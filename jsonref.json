She was very red and her skin was wrinkled from being so long in the water. We gave her water and she was checked by our medical team. She was also hungry so we gave her some vegetable soup and a chocolate mousse. She also had an isotonic energy drink and some fresh orange juice.\u0027He said a crew member lent her a T-shirt and a pair of trousers so she had dry clothes to wear.She slept for about an hour on a sofa as the ship returned to shore.  By then, her shorts had dried and she changed back in to them.Last night, questions continued to be asked about exactly what had happened when Miss Longstaff, who lives on the Costa del Sol in Spain, tumbled from the cruise liner shortly before midnight on Saturday, off northern Croatia, around 60 miles south of Pula.She has been accused of causing huge disruption to passengers, and costing Norwegian Cruise Line hundreds of thousands of pounds for delays caused by the incident.Lawyer Jim Fisher, an expert in cruise ship accidents, said 80 per cent of incidents of people going overboard from cruise liners were linked to alcohol, while 5 per cent were trying to take their lives.Andy Harmer, director of the Cruise Lines International Association industry body, said: \u0027Cruise ships today are the safest that ever sailed thanks to the rules and technological innovations that govern their design. There are no known cases of someone acting responsibly who has accidentally fallen over the railing of a cruise ship.\u0027 He said safety regulations included uniform minimum railing and balcony heights of 1m, plus other structural barriers to prevent passengers falling off a ship.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/21/23/38B1592300000578-6084521-image-a-63_1534889998146.jpg","title":"Help Great British Bake contestants Paul Hollywood says dumbed viewers","story":"    Paul Hollywood has revealed he has \u0027reined back\u0027 the technical challenges for this year\u0027s The Great British Bake Off so the public can keep up          Celebrity chef Paul Hollywood said The Great British Bake Off is \u0027going back to basics\u0027 French food blogger, 26, who shares Instagram snaps of...Mother of jet-setting GBBO contestant Ruby Bhogal launches...Share this articleHe said: \u0027I wanted to go back to basics to a point because I think leading up to last year\u0027s technical challenges people were saying to me, \u0027I couldn\u0027t do that\u0027.

Last year two people were arrested on charges of sexual assault.  Unlike more traditional music festivals, Burning Man organizers are tasked with teaching Burners that freedom on the playa doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a free for all.          The issue of sexual harassment at festivals have finally come to light with the rising movement, and  organizers must teach Burners that the festival\u0027s free spirit doesn\u0027t mean a free for all\u0027Just because we aim to be sexually liberated doesn\u0027t mean we are,\u0027 Donna Rae Watson told the Reno Gazette-Journal.  \u0027In the Burn community, you run into this attitude where we welcome the stranger, but sometimes that translates into: We have to accept their behavior. That\u0027s not how it should be.\u0027 Watson is the director of the Bureau of Erotic Discourse, a camp on the playa with the sole purpose of teaching Burners about consensual sex.  \u0027We\u0027re an experimental community, but we still bring the problems from the default world into the burn,\u0027 she said.  \u0027Our sole purpose is to bring consent front and center and incorporate it into the ethos of the culture, where boundaries are respected and our bodies are respected.\u0027\u0027We\u0027re taught the basics of consent in first grade: Don’t touch people without their consent, but we fail to extrapolate that to the sexual arena. We aim to fill that gap\u0027 That includes teaching Burners that scandalous costumes and nudity should not be considered an all-inclusive invitation.       Burning Man organizers are now also getting involved, this year sending attendees an email reminding them about the importance of consent for sex, touch, or photosAnd then there is Vika Viktoria, who hosts underground men\u0027s salons in order to help male Burners get in touch with different ideas surrounding masculinity. \u0027The men were immediately more fearless, there was an understanding that everyone there was curious and they wanted to be better,\u0027 she said. \u0027In the default world, there are several defenses that need to come down to get to that same crux of curiosity.\u0027 But not everyone is ecstatic about the changes on the playa.Ted Allen, who runs the Hug Church, has seen a sense of trust disappear since he first came to the festival 13 years ago.           B.E.D is now no longer the only camp on the playa that is working to preach consensual sex, while others are forming to give women their own safe space entirelyAllen said that he now offers a handshake before giving out hugs as a way of asking for consent. \u0027This is not a handshake culture, this is not a handshake society,\u0027 he said. \u0027You can get that anywhere else.

The creature remained for a few minutes caught in the moonlight before disappearing.It follows a \u0027remarkable, feature film length\u0027 video of the Loch Ness Monster shot by a Nessie watcher from Ireland on April 30.Hospital clerical worker Eoin O\u0027Faodhagain from Donegal took a ten minute video from the Loch Ness webcam.The creature moves from right to left and as it swam towards Urquhart Bay - a favourite haunt of Nessie - and is seen ing and surfacing with water splashes.DNA sampling recently took place to discover previously unrecorded organisms in Loch Ness.                             I am totally excited by this photograph - it is the best of \u0027Nessie\u0027 in years                        However Prof Neil Gemmell, a New Zealand scientist leading the project, said he did not believe in Nessie, but was confident of finding genetic codes for other creatures.Prof Gemmell of New Zealand\u0027s University of Otago said a \u0027biological explanation\u0027 might be found to explain some of the stories about the Loch Ness Monster.He said: \u0027Wouldn\u0027t it be amazing if we did find something extraordinary during our investigation.\u0027Is there anything else, perhaps something unusual, such as a giant catfish, sturgeon or eel, or a species unknown to science? It seems unlikely, but who knows?\u0027Results of the project are expected in early 2019.Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster set new global records last year.Nessie\u0027s 11 accepted sightings in 2017 were the highest this century.According to Google, there are around 200,000 searches each month for the Loch Ness Monster, and around 120,000 for information and accommodation close to Loch Ness. The monster mystery is said to be worth £30m to the region.Irish missionary St Columba is first said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD. Since then there have been 1080 officially logged sightings.Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson.The image was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.The Home Office last year rejected a cheeky bid by a group of artists from Glasgow to grant the Loch Ness Monster permanent UK residency after Brexit. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/22/10/4F4B718B00000578-0-image-m-23_1534930740908.jpg","title":"Cottage Cornwall inspired DH Lawrence Michael Morpurgo goes market 750 000","story":"    The two-storey granite cottage in the Cornish village of Zennor has gone on the market for £750,000.

In the UK, only 3 per cent of spending is made using cash, the findings suggest.According to the study, the prevalence of items with prices ending in .99p has fallen in recent years and now only accounts for around 12 per cent of prices.Using data from the ONS for February this year, it is evident that roughly 70 per cent of prices in the UK already end in a zero or 5, and so would not need rounding at all, according to the Bank\u0027s two economists.While some consumers may be attached to them, surveys suggest that six in ten 1p and 2p coins are used in a transaction once before they leave the cash cycle.            Falling: The decline in prices ending in .99, according to two Bank of England economistsMany end up in \u0027jars, down the back of the sofa or just lost to the ether.\u0027 To meet demand created by such losses from circulation, in previous years the government and the Royal Mint have needed to produce and issue over 500million 1p and 2p coins each year to replace those falling out of circulation, the Bank\u0027s two economists suggest.

Mr Corbyn (pictured in Scotland yesterday) was praised in some of the propaganda material that has been deleted by Facebook          Some of the pages removed by Facebook also lampooned Brexit, including with this image In July, the Electoral Commission fined official Brexit campaign group Vote Leave and reported senior figures to the police for breaking electoral law with Facebook adverts targeting voters in the build-up to the EU referendum in 2016.\u0027We\u0027ll see more of this activity between now and the US mid-term elections (in November). But Facebook has not really been investing in looking at this activity and the problem is probably much larger than we\u0027ve seen,\u0027 said Mr Collins.Cybersecurity firm FireEye first alerted Facebook to a network of pages operating under the name Liberty Front Press, posing as \u0027news and civil society organisations\u0027.Mr Gleischer said website data linked 74 pages, 70 accounts and three groups which targeted UK and US politics on Facebook, as well as 76 Instagram accounts, to Iran\u0027s state media.These pages hosted three events and spent more than 6,000 dollars (£4,666) in advertising, he said, although he gave no details about the events and adverts or what would happen to the money paid to Facebook for promotion.\u0027About 155,000 accounts followed at least one of these pages, 2,300 accounts joined at least one of these groups, and more than 48,000 accounts followed at least one of these Instagram accounts,\u0027 he said.A second, smaller network linked to Liberty Front Press tried to hack into user accounts and spread malware.The oldest network was created in 2011 and largely posted about Middle East politics in Arabic and Farsi but also shared content in the UK and US, including the page Free Scotland 2014.The network spent more more 6,000 dollars in advertising on Facebook and Instagram, paid for in US dollars, Turkish lira and Indian rupees between July 2012 and April 2018.Facebook said it was still investigating the networks and has shared information with the US and UK governments.FireEye plans to release a full report into the activity but has not specified a date.Mr Collins said the fake news inquiry will release its final report in the autumn, after the Information Commissioner completes a parallel investigation into how Facebook handles users\u0027 personal information. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/22/18/4F4EEFC400000578-6087055-image-a-3_1534957400904.jpg","title":"Motorists fume M25 turns car park","story":"    The crash took place at 7.10pm when the vehicle struck the nearside barrier and came to rest down the motorway embankment near to a brook for the River Lea.Police said a 32-year-old man from the Czech Republic was \u0027reported for careless driving with the matter being referred to the courts\u0027 following the crash.    Extraordinary aerial photographs showed the scale of the traffic jams, with vehicles still stuck this afternoon, nearly 24 hours after the accident occurred.The delays have been partially due to repairs being made to barriers damaged in the crash, and motorists were urged to allow extra time if travelling in the area. The road remained closed throughout the morning rush hour, before a crane was used to complete the recovery of the lorry and its load this afternoon.           The collision on the M25 near Waltham Abbey in Essex led to huge delays for motorists today          The lorry was eventually lifted back into place by a crane after the crash in Essex yesterday          Queues ran for around seven miles, with travel time through the section at 80 minutes          The lorry loaded flammable liquids had overturned after coming off the motorway yesterday          The queues come after the incident on the anticlockwise carriageway of the M25 last night          The lorry came to rest down the motorway embankment near to a brook for the River Lea          Queues of seven miles formed, with roads around the M25 accident site facing severe delays and ersionsLast blast of summer!

One of the biggest ever August bank holiday rail engineering schedules will see 9,600 Network Rail workers carry out more than 400 works costing £84million.Britain\u0027s fifth busiest station London Euston will be closed for the whole weekend, with west coast main line passengers told to avoid all but essential rail travel.Other towns and cities which will be affected by works this weekend include Derby, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Wigan, Preston and Blackburn.And holidaymakers flying out from the North West face chaos after staff at Liverpool John Lennon Airport voted to strike for 36 hours over a pay offer.The move by the GMB union means 80 workers from firefighting services, control room, engineering and airport bird control will walk out during the weekend.There are also fears of more two hour-plus passport control queues at London Heathrow Airport for non-European passengers, as happened last month.

Students are also reminded to bring their sixth form or college paperwork with them.          The GCSE test results can be obtained either in-person or by post if requested by the studentWhat do the new GCSE grades mean?The 2018 GCSE results will feature a new grading system that will change how the tests have been scored.The new grading system will see the traditional A* to G grades replaced with a numerical grading system of nine to one.A nine will represent the highest grade while a one is the lowest passing mark. U will still represent a failing mark in the new grading system.A and A* grades are now essentially the equivalent of a seven, eight or nine mark.Passing marks of B and C are now roughly represented by four, five and six.The D, E, F and G grades are now the equivalent of the new one, two and three grades.How grades impact college coursesIf students don’t have the grades they need for their college courses, they should contact the sixth form or college they’ve applied to as soon as possible.Some colleges, it should be noted, have stringent requirements that they adhere to when it comes to GCSE grades while others have much more relaxed rules and will allow students to attend the course regardless of their GCSE grades.Students seeking to improve their grades will be able to retake the Math and English Language GCSEs in November 2018. For all other subjects, the earliest date to retake them will be in June 2019.          How GCSE grades impact college courses generally depends on specific school requirementsHow to dispute a GCSE markStudents who believe they’ve been given an incorrect mark are eligible to dispute it and have their test results remarked.Those interested in doing so should speak to a teacher after obtaining their test results and submit an exam appeal form to request a review of their test marks.This process is required to be done at a student’s school unless they’re homeschooled. New on Netflix in September 2018: New TV shows and movies revealedNational Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday, 22 AugustHow Meghan Markle won Princess Charlotte and Prince George over with clever trickGCSE results day 2018: When are the results out and what do the new grades mean?Who is Deborah Hutton?

The couple are pictured on their wedding day in Gibraltar in 2014She told the Mirror: \u0027Craig\u0027s not a very nice person when he\u0027s been drinking. So him going on a cruise is a recipe for disaster. I can imagine what she went though.\u0027 It comes as the captain of the ship that rescued Miss Longstaff revealed she continued to complain about her boyfriend even after being hauled to safety. Passengers have claimed the couple rowed before she fell from the Norwegian Star\u0027s seventh deck.Describing the moment Miss Longstaff was pulled from the water after her 10 hour ordeal, rescue ship Captain Lovro Oreskovic said: \u0027She was talking about the boyfriend. I can\u0027t tell you exactly what she said because it\u0027s all under investigation, but she didn\u0027t say anything positive.\u0027¿Can I have pudding?¿ Exhausted British cruise ship ¿jumper¿...\u0027Stupid woman!\u0027 Mother of cruise boss blasts British...Share this articleMiss Longstaff laughed and joked with Mr Rayment after they were able to relax following her 10 hour ordeal in the Adriatic Sea.The 46-year-old - who has claimed she fell from the cruise liner Norwegian Star - was in a happy mood as she left a restaurant at a four star hotel on the outskirts of the romantic Italian city.Miss Longstaff dined with other members of her boyfriend\u0027s family at the Crowne Plaza hotel before going up to her room shortly after 9pm.Wearing a red dress and her hair loose, she showed no ill effects of being in the sea for such a long time and close to death.          Kay Longstaff is given a warm hug after her ordeal          The couple refused to answer any questions as they left the restaurant hand-in-hand to return to their roomThe couple refused to answer any questions as they left the restaurant hand-in-hand to return to their room.Miss Longstaff had been kept overnight on Sunday in a psychiatric ward in Pula, Croatia, for observation before she was collected by her partner.Senior doctors said she was checked over for signs of acute stress after the terrifying ordeal but was \u0027a healthy woman\u0027 and \u0027in good spirits\u0027.Just over 24 hours after the extraordinary ordeal, and having travelled to Venice, she donned a knee-length dress for dinner with her boyfriend and two other family members in their hotel in the romantic Italian city – the original disembarkation point of her £1,000-a-head luxury cruise.She could be seen laughing and joking before they came out at around 10.30pm and hugged each other goodbye.A relative, speaking after the family meal, said: \u0027It\u0027s something that\u0027s happened, they just want to put it behind them now. We\u0027re family, we look after each other. I can tell you now they will not speak. A lot of what\u0027s said has been wrong – apparent \u0027friends\u0027 speaking and people on board the ship who don\u0027t know anything.\u0027    Kay Longstaff and Craig Rayment hold hands in their hotel in Venice          British tourist Kay Longstaff exits Croatia coast guard ship in Pula, near the Croatian coast\u0027The boyfriend said they\u0027d been drinking and had quarrelled. He went back to his cabin and left her. The next thing he knew he was woken by the crew to say they thought she was missing as they had found her belongings.\u0027By this point a search was being carried out by the crew and the ship doubled back and carried out at least four passes. The coastguard then took over, and the ship went on to Venice.Doubts have been cast on Miss Longstaff\u0027s claim that she fell from the liner.The captain of the ship said she was a \u0027jumper\u0027 while the director of a trade organisation representing over 50 cruise companies said it was unheard of for anyone acting \u0027 responsibly\u0027 falling off a ship.Other passengers on the week long cruise around the Greek islands claimed the couple had been arguing and drinking prior to Longstaff going over the side.After spending a night in hospital in the Croatian port of Pula she was discharged and driven to Venice at her pre booked hotel.Medical staff in Pula said Longstaff had mild hypothermia symptoms but was otherwise in good condition despite spending 10 hours in the water.Survival experts said the relatively warm temperature of the sea and lack of wind to churn up the waves helped in her survival.Miss Longstaff remained hidden away in her hotel room and told staff not to put any calls through.  Air stewardess almost drowned - because rescue plane couldn\u0027t see her frantic wavingThe British woman who spent ten hours in the sea after going overboard from a cruise ship was forced to watch a rescue plane circle above for up to two hours before being saved, it was revealed yesterday.The captain of the boat that rescued Kay Longstaff said she was probably not seen from the air because she was not in a life jacket and was only just above the water.Lovro Oreskovic, commander of the coastguard patrol boat Cavtat, also said it took his crew \u0027just five minutes\u0027 to find her after they arrived in the area where she was reported to have gone overboard from the Norwegian Star.He claimed her miraculous survival was a rebirth, adding: \u0027We wish her all the best in her new life.      Ms Longstaff posted Facebook pictures of herself during the cruise including when the vessel docked off the Greek island of Santorini (pictured) last week          Another of her holiday snaps posted on Facebook shows the Norwegian Star near shore during the Mediterranean cruise last week \u0027She was very happy, very relieved and very grateful when we found her. The first thing she said to us when she came on board was, \u0027You saved my life! You saved my life!\u0027.\u0027She was in shock and dehydrated. She was very red and her skin was wrinkled from being so long in the water. We gave her water and she was checked by our medical team. She was also hungry so we gave her some vegetable soup and a chocolate mousse. She also had an isotonic energy drink and some fresh orange juice.\u0027He said a crew member lent her a T-shirt and a pair of trousers so she had dry clothes to wear.She slept for about an hour on a sofa as the ship returned to shore.  By then, her shorts had dried and she changed back in to them.Last night, questions continued to be asked about exactly what had happened when Miss Longstaff, who lives on the Costa del Sol in Spain, tumbled from the cruise liner shortly before midnight on Saturday, off northern Croatia, around 60 miles south of Pula.She has been accused of causing huge disruption to passengers, and costing Norwegian Cruise Line hundreds of thousands of pounds for delays caused by the incident.Lawyer Jim Fisher, an expert in cruise ship accidents, said 80 per cent of incidents of people going overboard from cruise liners were linked to alcohol, while 5 per cent were trying to take their lives.Andy Harmer, director of the Cruise Lines International Association industry body, said: \u0027Cruise ships today are the safest that ever sailed thanks to the rules and technological innovations that govern their design. There are no known cases of someone acting responsibly who has accidentally fallen over the railing of a cruise ship.\u0027 He said safety regulations included uniform minimum railing and balcony heights of 1m, plus other structural barriers to prevent passengers falling off a ship.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/22/03/4F4A4D8000000578-6085155-image-a-47_1534905320638.jpg","title":"Burning Man grapples consent amid MeToo movement","story":"    Burning Man is learning how to coincide its reputation of sexual liberation with the burgeoning #MeToo movement That is the exact question organizers are attempting to tackle as they prepare for the onslaught of 80,000 burners in Black Rock City come the first week of September.And it is one that all music festivals have had to grapple with recently as the issue of rampant sexual harassment has finally come to light.  A Teen Vogue article went viral earlier this year after the writer talked to 54 women who all said they had been harassed at Coachella. And Burning Man is not immune. The festival\u0027s Sexual Assault Services department revealed it receives between five to 20 reports of alleged sexual assault each year. Last year two people were arrested on charges of sexual assault.  Unlike more traditional music festivals, Burning Man organizers are tasked with teaching Burners that freedom on the playa doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a free for all.          The issue of sexual harassment at festivals have finally come to light with the rising movement, and  organizers must teach Burners that the festival\u0027s free spirit doesn\u0027t mean a free for all\u0027Just because we aim to be sexually liberated doesn\u0027t mean we are,\u0027 Donna Rae Watson told the Reno Gazette-Journal.  \u0027In the Burn community, you run into this attitude where we welcome the stranger, but sometimes that translates into: We have to accept their behavior. That\u0027s not how it should be.\u0027 Watson is the director of the Bureau of Erotic Discourse, a camp on the playa with the sole purpose of teaching Burners about consensual sex.  \u0027We\u0027re an experimental community, but we still bring the problems from the default world into the burn,\u0027 she said.  \u0027Our sole purpose is to bring consent front and center and incorporate it into the ethos of the culture, where boundaries are respected and our bodies are respected.\u0027\u0027We\u0027re taught the basics of consent in first grade: Don’t touch people without their consent, but we fail to extrapolate that to the sexual arena. We aim to fill that gap\u0027 That includes teaching Burners that scandalous costumes and nudity should not be considered an all-inclusive invitation.       Burning Man organizers are now also getting involved, this year sending attendees an email reminding them about the importance of consent for sex, touch, or photosAnd then there is Vika Viktoria, who hosts underground men\u0027s salons in order to help male Burners get in touch with different ideas surrounding masculinity. \u0027The men were immediately more fearless, there was an understanding that everyone there was curious and they wanted to be better,\u0027 she said. \u0027In the default world, there are several defenses that need to come down to get to that same crux of curiosity.\u0027 But not everyone is ecstatic about the changes on the playa.Ted Allen, who runs the Hug Church, has seen a sense of trust disappear since he first came to the festival 13 years ago.           B.E.D is now no longer the only camp on the playa that is working to preach consensual sex, while others are forming to give women their own safe space entirelyAllen said that he now offers a handshake before giving out hugs as a way of asking for consent. \u0027This is not a handshake culture, this is not a handshake society,\u0027 he said. \u0027You can get that anywhere else.

Something\u0027s there. With all the sightings over the years there must be something in the loch.\u0027Nessie expert Steve Feltham - who has dedicated his life to solving the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster for the past 27 years - was astonished by the image.\u0027I am totally excited by this photograph - it is the best of \u0027Nessie\u0027 in years,\u0027 said Mr Feltham, 55, who is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records for the longest continuous monster hunting vigil of Loch Ness.          There have been four official sightings this year of the Loch Ness Monster\u0027There is clearly a solid object in it and it is relatively clear. It warrants further study.\u0027There may be a mundane explanation such as a seal, but I have not heard of a seal in the loch this year. For my money it is larger than a seal or an ottter. It is a fantastic picture by Charlotte.\u0027Mr Feltham, who lives on the shores of Loch Ness at Dores, added: \u0027This is just the image we have been waiting for - for years. Congratulations Charlotte. I am totally excited by it.\u0027There have been four official sightings this year of the Loch Ness Monster.The last previous glimpse of Nessie occurred on August 5 at 9.38am when the family, regular visitors to the area, were on holiday - also from Leeds.It has now been accepted by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings\u0027 Register.\u0027After travelling from Drumnadrochit to Fort Augustus they looked out at the loch and spotted a strange looking lump on the surface of the water, which was very still and quiet at the time,\u0027 said the register.\u0027It looked dark brown in colour and \u0027sort of like an upturned boat\u0027. They revisited the area by boat in the afternoon and there was nothing like that in that area. Unfortunately because they were driving and couldn\u0027t pull in, they didn\u0027t manage to get any pictures.\u0027In June the first sighting of the Loch Ness Monster in moonlight was recorded - and in front of an 11-year-old girl.The third sighting of the year of the legendary monster was also accepted by the official Nessie register.Natalie Hodgson and her family, on holiday from Yorkshire, took a picture of the head of an unknown creature in the water at 10.30pm on June 1 from the Highland Lodges holiday park where they were staying. The creature remained for a few minutes caught in the moonlight before disappearing.It follows a \u0027remarkable, feature film length\u0027 video of the Loch Ness Monster shot by a Nessie watcher from Ireland on April 30.Hospital clerical worker Eoin O\u0027Faodhagain from Donegal took a ten minute video from the Loch Ness webcam.The creature moves from right to left and as it swam towards Urquhart Bay - a favourite haunt of Nessie - and is seen ing and surfacing with water splashes.DNA sampling recently took place to discover previously unrecorded organisms in Loch Ness.                             I am totally excited by this photograph - it is the best of \u0027Nessie\u0027 in years                        However Prof Neil Gemmell, a New Zealand scientist leading the project, said he did not believe in Nessie, but was confident of finding genetic codes for other creatures.Prof Gemmell of New Zealand\u0027s University of Otago said a \u0027biological explanation\u0027 might be found to explain some of the stories about the Loch Ness Monster.He said: \u0027Wouldn\u0027t it be amazing if we did find something extraordinary during our investigation.\u0027Is there anything else, perhaps something unusual, such as a giant catfish, sturgeon or eel, or a species unknown to science? It seems unlikely, but who knows?\u0027Results of the project are expected in early 2019.Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster set new global records last year.Nessie\u0027s 11 accepted sightings in 2017 were the highest this century.According to Google, there are around 200,000 searches each month for the Loch Ness Monster, and around 120,000 for information and accommodation close to Loch Ness. The monster mystery is said to be worth £30m to the region.Irish missionary St Columba is first said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD. Since then there have been 1080 officially logged sightings.Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson.The image was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.The Home Office last year rejected a cheeky bid by a group of artists from Glasgow to grant the Loch Ness Monster permanent UK residency after Brexit. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/22/16/4F4E843200000578-6086447-image-a-20_1534950891895.jpg","title":"Motorists slam council poor signage traffic enforcement camera makes 100 000 day","story":"Vehicles were spotted making a now illegal left turn from Mare Street onto Richmond Road in Hackney, east London in June.

The same one I had been reporting.\u0027Mr Madley added that it took a full day for the ceiling collapsed to be cleared up, and that water was still coming through the family\u0027s hotel room ceiling.\u0027We had to paddle through water in our room and waste all our towels daily to try to make the floor not so slippy.\u0027Two days before we were due to come home our nine-year-old daughter had an accident going to the bathroom - due to the flooded floor.  The family used the bathroom bin to mitigate the leak during their stay at the Mexican hotel\u0027This resulted in a head injury caused by your neglect. The representatives were still not interested.\u0027Upon returning home I then have a confirmed case of cyclospora caught from the hotel.\u0027If this is not investigated and a full report, along with an explanation and settlements within the next week, I will be starting legal proceedings.\u0027Mr Madley attached a photograph of the hotel corridor when the ceiling had collapsed, left debris all over the floor and a gaping hole above.  The pictures show soggy towels strewn across the floor in an attempt to mop up the leaksIn other images taken by the family during their stay, water can be seen dripping through the light fitting in the bathroom.The pictures also show soggy towels strewn across the floor in an attempt to mop it up. The family also used the bathroom bin to mitigate the leak. Speaking today, Mr Madley said: \u0027Safe to say all in all the holiday was a complete disaster. This was supposed to be a time of relaxation and making memories.\u0027Not mopping up water and wasting our time constantly reporting issues and waiting for people that never turn up along with accidents.          The family want holiday firm TUI to probe what went wrong at the Bahia Principe Coba Hotel\u0027I will be looking to start legal proceedings if they do not have this investigated properly and provide me with a satisfactory response and resolution.\u0027Mr Madley added that the family had to deal with many other problems which he believes were caused by the leaks - including constant dripping from the ceiling, intermittent air con and flickering lights.He said: \u0027It was interesting that all the electrical appliances within the room appeared to be faulty when water was leaking through. It was probably the cause of all this.\u0027However, Mr Madley believes he caught the disease after eating from one of the hotel\u0027s restaurants.          How the bathroom at the hotel appeared in the brochure photographs - without any leaksHe added: \u0027There was a variety of buffets and a la carte restaurants all included in the package and where all based within the resort, as part of the hotel.\u0027I went to the doctors and got antibiotics, (and) took stool samples for parasites and disease. The main ones came back and nothing was found.\u0027The doctor advised a lot of cases of cyclospora have been reported and symptoms stemmed towards it being this.\u0027I had severe stomach cramps and diarrhoea and ended up taking three weeks off work. I\u0027m still not great now. But much better than I was.\u0027          Mr Madley took to social media at the weekend to vent his frustration at the holiday firmThe family were also annoyed by the pictures used by the travel company to advertise the Mexican resort against what it actually looked like, which they say was a beach covered in seaweed and \u0027rotten\u0027.Mr Madley told TUI he wants a full investigation \u0027to be completed and compensation awarded along with acknowledgment of their neglect and an apology\u0027.He said: \u0027I would like to see what they believe is a fair settlement once they have completed their investigation. Legal action will only be taken if they do not comply with a full investigation and offer a fair settlement.\u0027A spokesman for TUI said: \u0027We are sorry to hear about the Madley family\u0027s experience on their recent holiday to Mexico and we will be contacting Mr Madley directly to discuss the issues raised.\u0027We\u0027d like to reassure customers that we regularly audit all of the hotels we feature in respect of health and safety.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/04/4EFA68D700000578-0-image-m-42_1533871154628.jpg","title":"Crazy Rich Asians author skipped national service","story":"Author Kevin Kwan and actor Michelle Yeoh at the US premiere of \u0027Crazy Rich Asians\u0027  The film version of Crazy Rich Asians has been a huge success in the US grossing $35million during last weekend\u0027s opening weekenedIt said authorities rejected his application in 1994 to renounce his Singaporean citizenship without serving the mandatory national service.The ministry of defence said: \u0027Mr Kwan has committed offences under the Enlistment Act, and is liable to a fine of up to 10,000 dollars (£7,700) andor imprisonment of up to three years upon conviction.\u0027Mr Kwan did not travel to Singapore for Tuesday night\u0027s premiere of the hit romantic comedy based on his book.Eight people in two bedrooms and one in the living room: The...MoviePass now limiting which films you can see  to six a day...BREAKING NEWS: U.S. employers added 157,000 jobs in July as...Share this articleThe writer is descended from a wealthy Singaporean family.Much of Crazy Rich Asians is set in Singapore.

Mr Corbyn (pictured in Scotland yesterday) was praised in some of the propaganda material that has been deleted by Facebook          Some of the pages removed by Facebook also lampooned Brexit, including with this image In July, the Electoral Commission fined official Brexit campaign group Vote Leave and reported senior figures to the police for breaking electoral law with Facebook adverts targeting voters in the build-up to the EU referendum in 2016.\u0027We\u0027ll see more of this activity between now and the US mid-term elections (in November). But Facebook has not really been investing in looking at this activity and the problem is probably much larger than we\u0027ve seen,\u0027 said Mr Collins.Cybersecurity firm FireEye first alerted Facebook to a network of pages operating under the name Liberty Front Press, posing as \u0027news and civil society organisations\u0027.Mr Gleischer said website data linked 74 pages, 70 accounts and three groups which targeted UK and US politics on Facebook, as well as 76 Instagram accounts, to Iran\u0027s state media.These pages hosted three events and spent more than 6,000 dollars (£4,666) in advertising, he said, although he gave no details about the events and adverts or what would happen to the money paid to Facebook for promotion.\u0027About 155,000 accounts followed at least one of these pages, 2,300 accounts joined at least one of these groups, and more than 48,000 accounts followed at least one of these Instagram accounts,\u0027 he said.A second, smaller network linked to Liberty Front Press tried to hack into user accounts and spread malware.The oldest network was created in 2011 and largely posted about Middle East politics in Arabic and Farsi but also shared content in the UK and US, including the page Free Scotland 2014.The network spent more more 6,000 dollars in advertising on Facebook and Instagram, paid for in US dollars, Turkish lira and Indian rupees between July 2012 and April 2018.Facebook said it was still investigating the networks and has shared information with the US and UK governments.FireEye plans to release a full report into the activity but has not specified a date.Mr Collins said the fake news inquiry will release its final report in the autumn, after the Information Commissioner completes a parallel investigation into how Facebook handles users\u0027 personal information. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/22/18/4F4EEFC400000578-6087055-image-a-3_1534957400904.jpg","title":"Motorists fume M25 turns car park","story":"    The crash took place at 7.10pm when the vehicle struck the nearside barrier and came to rest down the motorway embankment near to a brook for the River Lea.Police said a 32-year-old man from the Czech Republic was \u0027reported for careless driving with the matter being referred to the courts\u0027 following the crash.    Extraordinary aerial photographs showed the scale of the traffic jams, with vehicles still stuck this afternoon, nearly 24 hours after the accident occurred.The delays have been partially due to repairs being made to barriers damaged in the crash, and motorists were urged to allow extra time if travelling in the area. The road remained closed throughout the morning rush hour, before a crane was used to complete the recovery of the lorry and its load this afternoon.           The collision on the M25 near Waltham Abbey in Essex led to huge delays for motorists today          The lorry was eventually lifted back into place by a crane after the crash in Essex yesterday          Queues ran for around seven miles, with travel time through the section at 80 minutes          The lorry loaded flammable liquids had overturned after coming off the motorway yesterday          The queues come after the incident on the anticlockwise carriageway of the M25 last night          The lorry came to rest down the motorway embankment near to a brook for the River Lea          Queues of seven miles formed, with roads around the M25 accident site facing severe delays and ersionsLast blast of summer!

This is reflected in the Royal Mint’s production of 1p and 2p coins, which roughly halved in 2016-17 compared with the previous year. Production of pennies fell from about 500m to 288m.It is not the first time the future of the 1p and 2p coins has been questioned. At the time of the chancellor’s spring statement in March, the Treasury launched a review of cash and digital payments, and said it did not make economic sense to produce coins that were used infrequently.However, a day after the review was announced, Downing Street said it had no plans to axe 1p and 2p coins after a brief but determined media campaign and concerns raised by charities.As the  revealed last year, George Osborne came close to abolishing 1p and 2p coins when he was chancellor, but the idea was blocked by the prime minister, David Cameron, who thought the public might disapprove.Returning to the debate on Wednesday, the Bank of England economists called into question the cost-effectiveness of continuing to produce the coins.“As inflation slowly erodes the purchasing power of the penny, the balance between its usefulness and its cost begins to shift,” they argued.Angeli and Meaning said history suggested that scrapping low-denomination coins did not stoke inflation, citing the abolition of the halfpenny in 1984.“Many of the arguments that were made in the early 1980s around the inflationary impact of removing that particular tiny coin are being made now. However, the evidence, including our own work on UK price data, suggests they are unfounded,” the authors wrote."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd725010cbd60d6a5a7e49538eb49eed2c20151/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ea8d96b1385f475d9941277c39d06d0","title":"wall street record longest rally history bull market","story":"Tax cuts, QE, low inflation and tech profits push key S\u0026ampP 500 index towards 3,453 days without major correctionUS stock markets passed another landmark on Wednesday as the S\u0026ampP 500 recorded its longest rally ever, capping a near decade-long Wall Street boom that has gathered pace over the course of this year.One theory explaining the stock market terminology comes from the way both animals attack their opponents. A bull thrusts its horns up into the air, while a bear swipes downward.The previous record bull run started in October 1990, lasting almost a decade until the dotcom bubble burst around the turn of the millennium. There are, however, disputes over the starting point, which could render celebrations over the latest milestone premature.The US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority reckons the tech rally began in 1987, rather than 1990, meaning the current bull market would need to continue until at least the summer of 2021 to break the record.Some analysts argue that bull and bear market status is unclear, not set in stone, and that identifying the positions reflects an unhealthy obsession with arbitrary turning points in financial markets.The S\u0026ampP 500 was little changed in trading on Wednesday afternoon, hovering around 2,862 points, within touching distance of the record high reached in January. Among the best performers so far this year are Netflix, Twitter, and the watchmaker Fossil.The latest milestone comes as the US economy goes through its second longest-ever unbroken expansion, helped by low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve and sluggish inflation. Having collapsed during the crisis and still gradually recovering, stock markets have also benefited from the world’s biggest central banks pumping billions into their economies through quantitative easing.The rise of the tech firms has boosted the overall value of the US stock market. The five so-called Faangs – Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google – are together worth more than $3tn, a sum that makes them more valuable than the entire FTSE 100.Donald Trump’s corporate tax cuts have boosted US corporate profits, helping to drive the stock market higher. The president celebrated stocks reaching record levels earlier this year, tweeting: “Dow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.”Little more than a month after the US president’s tweet, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by more than 1,000 points amid fears over rising inflation that could have prompted the Fed to raise interest rates faster than expected. Concerns over a global trade war instigated by Washington have also rocked markets in recent months and could still pose a threat.Analysts said US stocks could continue rising over the course of this year, although warned against placing faith in arbitrary definitions of strength, such as markets having risen for a period or reaching certain levels.Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard, said: “Is there any reason for this trend in US equities to fade? Not quickly. We still expect strong growth in US economy next year, helped by the tax cuts. There are risks. The Fed could tighten too much, China could lose control of its debt problems, or Italian bonds could cause another sovereign debt crisis.”"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a9073dd5e5a2e3f8fbaac451d321d8159526719/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1b868a946f8b25eebe5c9f942e69ca5","title":"how to pollution proof your skin","story":"Polluted air is a problem whether you live in or out of town. Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to. Gentle cleansing, a hardworking hydrating cream, daily SPF and lots of red wine, I mean, lots of water, should ensure glowing skin, wherever you may be.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

It was founded by a group including Tom Shinner, former head of strategy at the Department for Education, and Jonathan Simons, a former No 10 adviser under Gordon Brown who later worked at the Policy Exchange thinktank co-founded by Gove.Parents were told this year that GFS was to be taken over from September by Ark, a multi-academy trust (Mat) that runs about 40 schools in England, including the lauded King Solomon academy in Paddington, central London.Simons, chair of the governors at GFS, said: “Originally the plan was that, as a free school trust, we would ourselves become a Mat and open primaries or collaborate with local primaries and essentially run a small Mat ourselves.”Instead, the strategic demands of running just one standalone school meant the trustees decided that a larger organisation would be better able to “future proof” the school, according to Simons.He said: “The most important thing is strategic capacity at the governor and trustee level. Any single school requires a huge amount of strategic oversight, whether that’s academic oversight, looking at the finances or managing major projects.“While you can share operational responsibility to a team of staff, ultimately you can’t discharge the major strategic decision making and the major calls that need to be made, to make sure you’re safeguarding taxpayers’ money. What we have concluded is that we don’t have the capacity to do that, as much as we think the school’s children and future children need.”Despite the move Simons vigorously defended the ability of outside groups to set up free schools,– and criticised the Department for Education’s efforts to more closely regulate the process amid signs of its flagging enthusiasm.“I would continue to urge the DfE to continue to allow that route to stay open, while recognising that the system ought to move towards smaller number of larger grouping of schools – which is not the same as saying it should be a local authority,” he said.While several free schools remain as standalones, Simons said the logical trend was for single academies to join a larger organisation, because of the pressure on those running the schools. “It’s those very practical things that make it very challenging – and this is a broad governance issue which applies to all schools. If you want professional, working, governors it’s quite difficult to do that,” Simons said.GFS’s first cohort of GCSE results last year was impressive, and Simons is confident that this year’s will be even better. But the school’s progress in its initial years has been rocky. Soon after its launch in 2012 GFS was praised by the Economist for its strong discipline policies and academic ethos along with its high proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals. But soon after the school parted company with its first headteacher and was hit by a critical inspection report from Ofsted in 2014, which rated it as “requiring improvement” and strongly criticised the school’s teaching of lower-ability, special needs and disabled pupils.

Plus, if he were to make a Bond movie (he previously expressed interest), perhaps he could bring along current It Girl Saoirse Ronan, who would make a good pupil for the retiring Craig, or even a sharp, younger foil.Ever since his 2005 remake of schlock classic House of Wax exceeded everyone’s expectations, the Spanish Collet-Serra has built a reputation for himself as the go-to director of modern day B-pictures. After all this time, he deserves a shot at the A-list.Collet-Serra would be an exciting choice for Bond 25 precisely because he’s the opposite of guys like Mendes or Forster. His take on the property would be a fun, muscular – and yes, kind of dumb – throwback to the early entries of the Moore or Brosnan eras, when these films had just the right amount of ridiculousness, but before they got completely bogged down in camp lunacy. He could also sweeten the pot by bringing along his regular leading man, Liam Neeson, who would bounce off Craig’s secret agent well as the main villain.Traditionally, Bond producers choose directors with a sturdy CV. However, as many a Marvel movie has proven, picking younger, less experienced film-makers can turn out quite well.French director Coralie Fargeat only has one feature-length film to her name – last year’s rape-revenge thriller titled (appropriately) Revenge – but as any viewer can attest, she’s more than ready to take on the responsibility of a major production. Her spin on the uber-masculine Bond mythos would prove a welcome (albeit controversial) change of pace for the overall series, even as her talent for eye-popping visuals, kinetic pacing, and gnarly physical violence would all but guarantee she would turn out a real barn burner. Bonus points if she brings along her Revenge lead, Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz, the platonic ideal of a Bond girl in the physical sense, but who could also imbue such a character with much-needed steeliness and intelligence.Given his penchant for alienating audiences with his Cronenberg-like brand of arthouse weirdness, the English Wheatley is the least likely choice on this list. Yet for as transgressive a film-maker as he is, he’s also a showman at heart, one entirely capable of delivering a crowd-pleasing slice of action cinema, evidenced by last year’s 90-minute shoot ’em up Free Fire (had a crowd actually shown up).Regardless of previous ticket sales, Wheatley would bring an edge to any 007 adventure, spiking major set pieces with a palpable sense of dread and an “anything-can-happen” vibe. He might also inject the franchise with its first dose of spookiness since the voodoo-themed shenanigans of 1973’s Live and Let Die. Again, he’s a wild card, but one that should be kept in the deck when considering potential replacements.In the tradition of Odd Job and Jaws, his frequent onscreen collaborator Michael Smiley would make an excellent addition to the Bond series’ collection of grotesque henchmen.Last but not least, fashion-designer-turned arthouse auteur Tom Ford already has a history with Bond, having designed Craig’s wardrobe the last time around. It would be fitting for Ford’s relationship with the franchise to mirror his larger career arc: moving from the role of tinkertailor for the soldierspy, and into the director’s chair.Ford would be groundbreaking on a couple of different fronts – not only would he be the first openly gay director in the series’ history, he would be the first American (Irvin Kershner was the closest, directing the “unofficial” entry Never Say Never Again). Should the producers deign to hand the reins over to someone from the colonies, they couldn’t pick a more cosmopolitan choice.The two films Ford has directed to date – his morose adaptation of Christopher Isherwood’s A Single Man and the pretentious arthouse-exploitation hybrid Nocturnal Animals – betray a penchant for style over substance, but if there is any franchise for which style should trump substance, it’s this one. Ford wouldn’t need help from previous collaborators his costume design and eye for set dressing are all that he would be required to bring with him. If nothing else, he’d make James Bond look his absolute best, and really, isn’t that the first rule of any good Bond movie?"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4fa0806712933e28cf1a34bb5d211b7f84abcbd/0_33_3096_1857/master/3096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdc918ee385ba004a9d2ce2d5c83c9ee","title":"fuelled by tequila george clooney tops list of highest paid actors","story":"Clooney earned almost a quarter of a billion dollars in 2017, Forbes reports, largely through the sale of alcohol outfit Casamigos TequilaBetween 1 June 2017 and 1 June 2018, George Clooney made more money than any other actor has ever made in a single year, Forbes magazine has found. The star’s film-based enterprises accounted for only a fraction of his income, however, with most coming from the sale of spirit company Casamigos Tequila. In 2013, Clooney co-founded Casamigos with Rande Gerber and Mike Meldman, initially as a way to supply them personally with sufficient quantities of high-quality liquor. Last year, British multinational Diageo purchased the brand in a deal worth a £1bn dollars. “If you asked us four years ago if we had a billion-dollar company, I don’t think we would have said yes,” said Clooney when the deal was announced. Now 57, Clooney – who also became the father of twins in 2017 – is best known in the drinks world for his endorsement of the coffee brand Nespresso. Clooney’s booze jackpot bumped Dwayne Johnson – who frequently tops the chart – into the second spot. Johnson doubled his earnings year on year, making $119m (£92m) from his involvement in multiple blockbusters, including Skyscraper and Rampage. Johnson’s Fast and Furious co-star, Vin Diesel, failed to make the top 10 this year, despite topping last year’s chart. Avengers stars including Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans all featured, alongside non-American names such as Jackie Chan, Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan. Clooney earned some $200m more than the highest-paid female actor, Scarlett Johansson, whose $40.5m total is thought to largely derive from her involvement in Marvel titles.

Loman said she finally relented and found Weinstein to be very professional during several meetings. The lawsuit says that changed, however, after he lured her to his hotel suite, presumably to discuss possible acting roles in some of his films. “Upon arriving at Weinstein’s suite ... Weinstein quickly dropped his professional demeanor. He instead overpowered Loman and raped her,” the lawsuit says. It adds that the 66-year-old former Hollywood producer subsequently made it clear to Loman that he could ruin her career if she came forward.“Fearful both that no one would believe her and the potential retaliation from such a powerful figure, Loman stayed silent,” the lawsuit says. “It was only upon the late 2017 revelation of the scope of Weinstein’s wrongful actions ... that Loman felt safe coming forward to seek redress for Weinstein’s rape of her.”Loman is suing Weinstein for assault, violation of human trafficking laws, battery and false imprisonment.Weinstein has been accused by dozens of women of numerous incidents of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to rape. He is out on bail and has pleaded not guilty in New York to six counts allegedly committed against three women in 2004, 2006 and 2013.

With fascism making a comeback in the United States, that’s been the question on many pundits’ minds, a decisive point where the rubber of ethics meets the road of politics. It’s also the central query of Operation Finale, a dramatization of the 1960 mission to retrieve Hitler’s henchman Adolf Eichmann from Argentina and bring him to stand trial in Israel. Extradition laws prohibited the Mossad agents tasked with apprehending the notorious SS officer from simply tossing him on a plane and calling it a day, so they had to first get his signature on an official document and then smuggle him out of the country incognito. The latter task wraps the film up with a risky extraction clipped out of a cut-rate Argo, but the former proves even more complicated.With one of the world’s most evil men tied to a chair, it would have been easy enough for his captors to beat a John Hancock out of him and proceed onward. They instead decided to do things the hard way, endeavoring to convince Eichmann that if he truly believed he was “only following orders”, as the common defense went, then he shouldn’t have any trepidation about proving it to a jury of his peers. So begins a rather sedate battle of wills between a mannered, urbane Eichmann (Ben Kingsley) and his strapping interrogator Peter Malkin (Oscar Isaac) in which neither party has a clear upper hand. After all, as the Mossad team states, this is a man who convinced millions to board trains leading them to their deaths. He knows how to work people.Kingsley’s done this all before: in 1994, he played a war criminal hiding out in South America who’s taken prisoner by a vengeful Sigourney Weaver and ultimately spared in an act of soul-cleansing mercy. That film, Roman Polanski’s adaptation of the play Death and the Maiden, mounted the same argument in favor of civility that Operation Finale sands to a soft nub. To lay hands on Eichmann, as one of Peter’s colleagues comes dangerously close to doing in a scene that all but instructs the audience to cry “No!”, would be to sink to his level. When they go genocidal, we go high.Aside from the occasionally turbulent tonal modulations between cracking espionage thriller and Silence of the Lambs-style two-hander, that moral reductionism is the blemish marring an otherwise well-acted thespians’ showcase. Chris Weitz’s direction and the dialogue in Matthew Orton’s script first paint Eichmann in a discomfortingly sympathetic light, daring the audience to buy his spiel about being a good German and doing right by his family. (Here’s the Hannibal Lecter bit Peter’s haunted by the memory of his dead sister, and makes the fatal error of letting Eichmann know this.) Accordingly, this leaves Isaac to play Peter as a gritty Captain Israel, an overly familiar mold with which he nevertheless does the best he can.It’s not especially convincing portraiture, not only because the average viewer knows what they know of Eichmann, but because he speaks like every other icy-veined manipulator to have come before him, including himself. He methodically works through the classic sociopath’s bait-and-switch, empathizing with Peter by exchanging names, then conversation, then gestures of mutual humanity. When he has the eventual outburst and the composed facade falls away, just as it did in Death and the Maiden, it affirms what the audience already knows but still might like hearing. Deep down, bad people are always villainous – the precise opposite of Hannah Arendt’s immortal wisdom about the “banality of evil” that Eichmann inspired.A conclusion this thin can’t hope to fill out Weitz’s two-hour run time, so there’s some other meshugas about a spoiled romance between Eichmann’s son (Joe Alwyn, unsettlingly well-cast as an Aryan Youth) and his unknowingly Jewish girlfriend (Haley Lu Richardson, the biggest stretch in a film weirdly intent on passing off goyim as members of the Tribe). We get some down time among the other members of Peter’s squad, least dull among them an officer played by Nick Kroll, who continues the test of how seriously audiences are willing to take him that he began in 2016 with Loving. And there’s the undercooked romantic subplot between Peter and Hanna (Mélanie Laurent), the team medic and token woman invented for the sole purpose of injecting a little passion for good measure.It all feels like padding for a film that doesn’t have the philosophical depth to back up its analytical ambitions. The debate over the utility of violence and the dignity owed prisoners of war has raged since time immemorial, and recent developments have only amplified the decibel level. Operation Finale zeroes in on these complex dynamics, only to erase their nuance. The final title cards spell out Eichmann’s demise as if to bring closure to the horrors of Nazism, but there’s ample evidence that the matter has only grown more insidiously tangled. What good is a ethical thought experiment that ends firm and unbothered, convinced of its own rightness?"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/6acf655a4c3e6805418cbf26469b740378b98c5f/17_186_5943_3569/master/5943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=837ff51ced7fc3f3787f4cb7e323b713","title":"barnums animals crackers change design after pressure from rights group","story":"Barnum’s Animals Crackers’ new design features a lion, elephant, giraffe, gorilla and zebra roaming free in a savannah-like paradiseIt took them 116 years but the African animals that feature on boxes of Barnum’s Animals Crackers have finally been freed from the circus. Since 1902, the packaging for the sweet crackers has featured caged circus animals being transported in a red and yellow wagon, with the Barnum name a reference to PT Barnum’s circus which for years travelled with caged animals.But in 2016 the animal rights organisation Peta advised the cracker-manufacturer Nabisco to change the design, because animals in circuses are often kept in cruel conditions.“Circuses tear baby animals away from their mothers, lock animals in cages and chains, and cart them from city to city … they have no semblance of a natural life,” Peta wrote in a letter to the company.Today Nabisco has revealed the new packet, which sees a lion, elephant, giraffe, gorilla and zebra roaming free in a savannah-like paradise, although if we are taking the packets of crackers seriously it’s worth pointing out that because of hunting and environmental change you’re unlikely to see all five animals sharing the same habitat in modern Africa.Both Peta and Nabisco have suggested that the change was a nod to animal welfare. A Nabisco spokesperson on Tuesday said that the brand had always driven “awareness around key animal and environmental issues” and that “to continue to make the brand relevant for years to come, we felt this was the right time for the next evolution in our design, now showing the animals in a natural habitat.”Peta claimed the change as a personal coup, tweeting “Big victories can come in small packages” and thanking Nabsico for heeding their advice.Still, the change may have as much to do with the declining popularity of circuses as it does with increased awareness of animal welfare. Animal-shaped biscuits had been popular in the US since the late 18th century, but Nabisco, then the National Biscuit Company set their brand apart in 1902 by adopting the “Barnum’s” name, evoking the circus theme of the Barnum and Bailey Circus, then one of the most popular circus attractions in the United States – although to this day the company has never paid a licensing or royalty fee to the circus.In 2017, though, the Barnum and Bailey circus, since merged with the Ringling Bros circus, put on its show for the final time, ending 146 years of entertainment. The circus blamed low attendances and high operating costs for the closure. It meant Nabisco now had a biscuit tribute to a circus that no longer exists. It was only after this closure, that the new box was designed.Over the years more than 50 different animals have featured inside the boxes, although some have been rejected because of their unusual shape. Alligators, apparently, were rejected because the product development team thought their tails would be too fragile and the biscuits might crack."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/56c02287d35baf275385f5399d97fa6c603ae991/0_167_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f17592508d795dc814c778c57dcb6ed3","title":"karan gokani omelette curry fast food recipe","story":"Leftover ingredients and larder staples make this quick and easy recipe a perfect go-to late-night protein-packed mealAn omelette curry is my choice of dinner when I’m looking for a late night protein-packed meal that still satisfies the craving for spice!

Chickpeas are a natural bedfellow for tahini, garlic and cumin. But chocolate? Mixed berries? Banoffee?It would help if Harry Tyndall had a rootsy backstory with which to sell his sweet hummus – if he were reviving an ancient Levantine dessert, say, or had been handed down a family recipe through 17 generations. But no – when he first had the idea, he struggled to find others who had tried anything similar (one US company, Delighted By Hummus, served as inspiration with its chocolate, vanilla and snickerdoodle flavours). His company, Hou Loves Hou, is the first to sell sweet hummus in the UK.Could the hot fudge brownies and creme brulees of this world really be defeated by hummus? Actually, Tyndall hopes to disrupt the spread market – compared with jams, nut butters and chocolate spreads, Hou is healthier, boasting lower sugar and saturated fat content, thanks to its virtuous chickpea base. Still, sweet hummus … would you put that in your mouth? I gamely opened the first of three nicely branded tubs (£2.99 for a 180g pot). All are smooth in texture, but the chocolate Hou is especially thick, thanks to the coconut milk included in its ingredients. The mixed berry Hou is the one that has the most detectable chickpea flavour, although it is unusual rather than unpleasant. It is being promoted as a jam alternative, but it is more like a creamy fruit spread. Banoffee is perhaps my favourite – a guilt-free substitute for nut butter that could work as a dessert filling – whereas the “choc-a-chick” chocolate hummus is similar to traditional chocolate spreads, not least in the sense that it is best eaten straight from the tub. All three make for a tasty, healthy breakfast when spread on brown bread. Tyndall suggests dipping strawberries in the chocolate one or serving the fruit hummus with yoghurt and granola (Delighted By Hummus has a range of recipes on its website including cookies, muffins and pretzels).Health is Tyndall’s main concern. He had a reckless youth, microwaving whole tubs of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and drinking them as smoothies. Now 30, he suffers from kidney stones and gout, possibly as a consequence. He had to reinvent his diet – no red meat, no red wine and definitely no ice-cream smoothies – and that is where the idea for Hou came from. He is especially excited about entering the children’s market I can confirm that my two-year-old was particularly enthusiastic about the mixed berry flavour, shouting “more hummus” repeatedly in a way that definitely wouldn’t sound sickeningly middle-class if aired in public.

Either way we once again have football public relations to thank for a tale of two cities. In Manchester we have Manchester City, whose enjoyable and interesting fly-on-the-wall Amazon documentary has received almost nothing but plaudits.Despite the series having been quite clearly subject to a form of copy approval by the club, City have been praised for their “risk-taking”. The results have been described as “not sanitised” in the Daily Mail, which was presumably still high on the Dettol fumes. I note one particular guy in Manchester did not much care for it but in general it went over as you might expect of a high-access documentary about a normally low-access obsession.In Rome, meanwhile, the Lazio ultras are operating on slightly less of a PR budget but they absolutely refuse to be held back by it. To this end the Irriducibili group has put out a flyer telling women to stay away from their section of the Stadio Olimpico, calling it a “sacred space”. I’ll spare you the full thesis but it goes: something something “we do not allow women, wives and girlfriends”, something something “experienced like the trenches”.This no-budget act has earned them approximately 20 miles of global column inches (20 miles 4 inches after this), and plenty of broadcast coverage. Either this scrap of leaflet gets denounced by pundits keen to make the point that banning women from places is bad or it gets denounced by various Lazio proxies, who say this is nothing to do with the club.I particularly enjoyed the Italian gentleman whom the Today programme appeared to have sourced from central casting and whom it was impossible to hear without imagining the arm gestures he would have been making as he naughtily refused to take it very seriously and batted away questions with airy rejoinders such as “you have never been there, my friend”.In general UK media outlets have been obligingly outraged that women should be denied, in a non-formal manner, the opportunity to sit with the chaps whose wide-ranging racism is occasionally the reason no one at all is able to sit anywhere in the Stadio Olimpico and watch Lazio play.I don’t wish to speak for the ladies of Rome but I imagine being told you can’t sit in the calcio Somme is a little like being told you can’t attend two hours of men’s rights performance poetry – upsetting, of course, but you get on with your day as best you can. The Italian FA has now opened an investigation. I myself thought about opening a joke about Italian FA investigations but have immediately closed it.Not for the first time, then, the Irriducibili’s PR gambit has proved that a little goes a long way. But a lot goes even further and we must marvel at City’s continuing ability to suggest there are Chinese walls between the club and the regime that owns it. The eight-part documentaryproductpiece of content ersification is the latest play in the emirate’s stunningly fast-tracked acquisition of soft power and influence.We can all see that football in the modern era is a vehicle for reputation laundering. Only last month Gianni Infantino dismissed the idea the World Cup had become a way for morally challenged regimes to launder their reputations. Mere moments later the Fifa president explained: “This World Cup certainly did change the perception of the world towards Russia. It changed a lot of pre-conceived opinions.” That’s the trouble – it is such fun to watch the laundry being done that it is easy to forget what caused the stains.And so with club ownership, Abu Dhabi style. The emirate’s rulers are hardly in it to make money and no one could accuse them of being especially interested in football. All the all-access documentaries in the world should not distract from the fact City’s owner is part of a regime of ghastly autocrats, and every attempt to misdirect attention away from that – no matter how pretty – is an action performed in that regime’s service. As the regional human rights expert Nicholas McGeehan has put it: “While Abu Dhabi may not be the most abusive government in the world, they are easily the most abusive government running a football club.”I’m not remotely suggesting people switch off City, widely acknowledged as among the most wonderfully watchable sides in the world. But we don’t always have to fall quite so completely for their owners’ sleight of hand. Trying not to look the wrong way is the very least we can do. This week those concerned about the sharp end of women’s rights would have been rather better off not rising to the Lazio ultras’ bait and focusing instead on the disconnect between an ultra-modern and attractively successful Premier League club of that documentary – one that spouts all the right things about equality and ersity and so on – and the oppressive regime that pays for it all.There is no space for a full rundown of the contrasts but by way of a flavour: UAE husbands are allowed to beat their wives marital rape is not a crime hundreds of rape victims are flogged or imprisoned every year under laws prohibiting extra-marital sex … it goes on and on.Are these bigger issues than the unofficial seating arrangements for Lazio games? Not so as you’d notice from the coverage."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/339b5841c918b829b1fec0f03d20235741f8cd65/42_340_1950_1170/master/1950.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b64c8b0aeb46c54be1fae67ef2d79667","title":"alleged massacre of amazon tribespeople javari valley brazil","story":"A paddle and bad recording of a bar-room conversation were all investigators had to go on when claims surfaced of killings deep in Brazil’s Javari Valley last yearWhen not selling breakfasts in this sleepy town on the western reaches of the Amazon, Algenor Costa fishes and hunts along the Jandiatuba River, as he has done for decades. Heading days upriver, he has often headed into the Javari Valley, a vast indigenous reserve where such activities are forbidden.“That’s the town larder,” he says. “Everybody enters there to fish and hunt.”Until last year, Costa, 53, sold his catch and prey to the crews of illegal gold dredgers – known as garimpeiros – who used this town as a support base before heading deep into the reserve, sucking up gold from the Jandiatuba River and pumping poisonous mercury into its muddy waters.Last year, however, Costa was at the centre of an inquiry into the alleged massacre of up to 10 tribespeople from an uncontacted group in the reserve. The case made headlines around the world, and forced the Brazilian government – who had already been alerted about the garimpeiros’ mining activities – into action. In late August, a pre-planned army operation destroyed four dredgers and seized another near the town. In November, Funai staff joined a second army operation that blew up ten more mining barges and headed into the reserve to look for evidence that a massacre had occurred.But they were unable to find anything conclusive. Instead, while prosecutors are still to close their investigation, the case has exposed the vulnerability of isolated groups in the Javari Valley, the prejudice indigenous people face in communities around them, and the difficulties of such investigations in areas of inaccessible wilderness.Locals said it was the third time the garimpeiros had set up in São Paulo de Olivença. Although many were out-of-towners, some locals, including Costa, delivered supplies to them. The garimpeiros barges’ were located days by boat from the town, deep inside the reserve.Costa and two other men, Manoel Castro and Roque Alves Rocha, were named in an anonymous denunciation received last August by Funai, Brazil’s indigenous agency, which included a badly recorded conversation and a photo of Costa with a paddle. The tip-off said the men had boasted of killing up to 10 indigenous people and had stolen the paddle and other artefacts. Other evidence led credibility to the denunciation. A flight over the area found some maloca longhouses had been burnt – common practice after a death in local tribes.Prosecutors in Tabatinga – a city six hours away by boat – opened an investigation and requested arrest warrants for the three men. A judge turned these down and authorised searches of their properties instead. Interviewed by TV Globo’s national news programme Jornal Nacional, the three men denied the accusations that they had been responsible for a massacre. “It is something I never did,” said Rocha. Castro said he had not seen the indigenous people, but that he and Costa had found two paddles in a canoe and taken one. Costa refused to say any more to the channel.But in an interview with the , Costa refuted being on the recording and said that he and Manoel Bida had found the paddle two years earlier in a canoe at a place called Três Bocas, deep inside the reserve, near footprints an isolated group had left crossing a river.“We didn’t see them, just their traces. It’s common there,” he says. Costa alleges that the supposed massacre had been devised by those who want to force the authorities to act over gold dredging, but doesn’t specify who this might be.He says it would be impossible to kill so many light-footed indigenous people and survive. He also alleges, despite having no evidence, that the isolated tribe practises cannibalism.“If they kill us, they eat us,” he says.Indigenous people around São Paulo de Olivença routinely face discrimination, but prejudice against them has increased since the denunciation, for which they were unjustly blamed, says one local leader, talking anonymously after receiving threats. Speaking to the , some local people say they feel indigenous people receive too much money in government benefits and believe the reserve is too big for the indigenous population that live there. Funai staff were threatened when they reached the town in November 2017 for a joint operation with army and environment agency officials, a federal prosecutor says. Three months had passed since the original tip-off – a delay criticised by Sydney Possuelo, a former Funai president who had been instrumental in gaining protected status for the Javari Valley.As they headed upriver, soldiers blew up 10 dredgers. Funai officials quizzed crews and left the soliders working to reopen one of the agency’s bases on the Jandiatuba River, which had been closed in 2012.This was important to deter garimpeiros from entering the area, says Beto Marubo, an indigenous leader working to raise international attention over the threats to the Javari Valley’s 16 isolated tribes.“Without these bases, the isolated Indians who roam this territory become vulnerable,” he says.The Funai group carried on up the Jandiatuba River. Before reaching Três Bocas, they had found an abandoned gold dredger. At the site of the alleged massacre, they found no sign of the killings – though what evidence would have remained after three months is unclear. No police took part in the expedition.This was a difficult trip involving arduous travelling through remote and inhospitable terrain, says Bruno Pereira, the Funai isolated indigenous specialist who led a team that included Jair Candor, one of Funai’s most experienced isolated authorities (featured in award-winning documentary Piripkura). Since 1987, Funai has avoided contact with isolated tribes – who have attacked and killed employees in the past, and been decimated by viruses passed on by outsiders. Trekking inland in search of signs that the tribe was healthy, they came across a plantation of fruit and vegetables, then a settlement. Because of the seriousness of the denunciation, they decided to enter and found fires still smouldering, temporary thatched-roof shelters called tapiri, slings for blowpipes, clay pots, arrowheads, bones of tapir, wild boar and alligator that had been cooked and eaten, as well as a body-length ceremonial mask.If the alleged massacre had happened, it was unlikely that this established settlement would still be there, he says, because isolated groups flee danger. This conclusion is shared by Daniel Mayaruna, 44, an indigenous man from Javari who was also on the expedition. Daniel saw a community of his “relatives” in good shape, but says the abandoned mining barge just 10km away was profoundly worrying.“There are a lot of isolated relatives in this region and my concern is that garimpeiros could kill them,” he says. Adam Mol, a volunteer Polish doctor, shot video footage of the village. “We didn’t find any indications of a massacre,” he says.Accusations of massacres are not unknown in the Javari Valley. Last August Bruno Pereira, the Funai official responsible for monitoring its isolated groups, led an expedition in the south of the reserve, following reports of another mass killing related by an indigenous man. Mol went with him.Mol brought a drone along – equipment that Funai did not have. The agency has been decimated by budget cuts under the austerity regime of President Michel Temer. As the expedition headed along the Jutaí River, around the area where the killing allegedly took place, they came across a small camp on the side of the water that the isolated group had just vacated, leaving an axe, bow and arrow and other artefacts behind. Then Mol’s drone spotted the main village just a kilometre away, with people, communal thatched buildings, and plantations. They retreated, reasoning that the group would have moved had they suffered a massacre.“The drone footage gave us the intel we needed,” says Mol.Both cases underline just how hard it is to investigate allegations of possible crimes in such remote regions. In Tabatinga, federal prosecutor Pablo Beltrand says the tip-off over the supposed Jutaí River massacre was “not such a reliable report” and presented “contradictions”. On the alleged massacre involving the tip-off, Beltrand has just received Funai’s report on the expedition and is analysing it. The agency had been reluctant to share sensitive information, such as the location of isolated groups. That the isolated tribe has stayed in the region is “something to be considered in the investigation”, Beltrand says. He has yet to conclude his inquiry. But he has little to go on – a paddle, a conversation, an anonymous denunciation. Meanwhile, smaller wooden mining barges are now reportedly being built beside a river in São Paulo de Olivença. The garimpeiros may yet return.

The latest findings provide the most compelling evidence to date that disrupted sleep alters the metabolism and boosts the body’s ability to store fat.The findings add to mounting scientific evidence on how disrupted sleep influences the usual rhythms of the body clock, raising the risk of a wide range of health problems from heart disease to diabetes.Jonathan Cedernaes, a circadian researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden and the paper’s first author, said the findings pointed to “the irreplaceable function that sleep has”.“Sleep is not just to conserve energy, it has so many functions,” he said.Time and again research has linked shift work and lack of sleep to the risk of obesity and diabetes, but the reasons behind this association are complex and have been difficult to elucidate. Insufficient sleep appears to disrupt hormones that control appetite and feelings of fullness. Those who sleep less have more time to eat, may be too tired to exercise and have less self-control when it comes to resisting the temptation of unhealthy snacks. A previous study by Cedernaes and colleagues showed that even a short period of sleep deprivation led people to eat more and opt for higher calorie food.To complicate matters further, obesity increases the risk of sleep apnoea, a breathing problem that itself disturbs sleep quality.The latest study provides new evidence that sleep deprivation having a direct influence on basic metabolism and the body’s balance between fat and muscle mass.In the study, published in the journal Science Advances, 15 healthy volunteers each attended a testing session on two occasions, once after a normal night’s sleep and once after staying up all night. During the visit, they gave samples of fat and muscle tissue and blood.After sleep deprivation, people’s fat tissue showed changes in gene activity that are linked to cells increasing their tendency to absorb lipids and also to proliferate.By contrast, in muscle the scientists saw reduced levels of structural proteins, which are the building blocks the body requires to maintain and build muscle mass. Previous epidemiological studies have also found shift workers and those who sleep less have lower muscle mass. This may be in part down to lifestyle factors, but the latest work shows that there are also fundamental biological mechanisms at play.“Sleep loss by itself is reducing proteins that are the key components of muscle,” said Cedernaes, although he added it is possible that diet and exercise could counteract these changes.The study also found an increase in inflammation in the body after sleep deprivation, which is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes.However, the authors said it would be important to investigate further to see whether the short-term changes they identified were sustained in people working shift patterns or experiencing sleep deprivation over longer time periods.The link between sleep deprivation and illness is of growing concern due to the increase in shift work and changes in sleep patterns across the world.The number of people regularly working nights in the UK has increased by 260,000 in the past five years, according to the TUC, which estimated last year that Britain’s late-night workforce has reached almost 3.2 million – equivalent to one in eight workers."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/89808ad6eafc3482ae22a7877929720fbde0bf8b/0_70_3111_1866/master/3111.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4e48a95c6bd00f84d3ee803066b5dbe","title":"madonna vmas aretha strangest tributes ever","story":"Madonna’s VMAs ode to Aretha Franklin has been labelled a self-indulgent disaster but it’s not the first time an onstage tribute has gone wrongLet’s get this out of the way from the get-go: Madonna’s rambling spiel about Aretha Franklin at the MTV Video Music Awards earlier this week was just about as weird as award show tributes get. Dressed as a berserk cross between a scarecrow and a dreamcatcher, Madonna took Franklin’s legacy and forced it through a prism so utterly self-regarding that even the jazzed-up kids in the audience looked like they were losing the will to live. It was just about as strange and awful as these things tend to get.But, hey, if we treat this as an excuse to show you a bunch of other dreadful award show tributes, maybe we’ll start to feel better about it. Maybe Madonna will even read this and realise that she is simply a thread in a rich tapestry of terrible tributes. So let’s do that.Actually, I hope Madonna isn’t reading this, because it turns out that she’s responsible for the second-weirdest awards show tribute too. Admittedly her 2009 tribute to Michael Jackson lacked the self-conscious performance art nature of her most recent work, but nevertheless it was still long and rambling and more about her than Jackson. She does these speeches once every nine years now, it seems. I’m already strapped in to see what she says about whoever dies first in 2027.It’s important to remember that not all tributes take the form of shapeless monologues. Most of the time, an awards show will just hire a vastly unsuitable act to perform some of the deceased’s best loved songs. That’s what happened at the Grammy a couple of years ago, when it hired the Hollywood Vampires – a supergroup comprising of Joe Perry, Johnny Depp and either Alice Cooper or Steve Carell doing a bad Alice Cooper impersonation – to sing some Motörhead songs after Lemmy died. It’s hard to know what was worse the fact that the music uniformly sounded like the Biker Mice from Mars theme tune, or the godawful stench of midlife crisis emanating from the stage.The fastest way to undercut the sincerity of a tribute – as proved by all the shots of puzzled kids during Madonna’s Franklin lecture – is with an audience cutaway. So it went when Christina Aguilera performed a medley of Whitney Houston songs at the American Music Awards last year. At the high point of I Will Always Love You, when for some reason or another Aguilera made a noise like a buffalo falling down the stairs, the camera cut to Pink. Pink was pulling a face like Larry David inspecting something that displeased him. She pulled it together into a smile by the end, but that one split second was excruciating.James Bond hadn’t died in 1982, but he was certainly on the ropes. Looking back, it is incredible that this wasn’t the final nail in the coffin. Sheena Easton was booked to perform her Bond theme For Your Eyes Only at the 1982 Oscars, but whoever designed the set had clearly never seen a Bond film. Easton arrived in a spaceship. A high-kicking James Bond in orange satin fired a laserbeam at a wall. Jaws was decisively murdered with a grenade. And then, at the climax, Bond got off with Easton in what I think was meant to be a time machine. This is the worst thing that has ever happened, and I will take any excuse to share the video online.Sadly, all trace of this performance has been wiped from the internet. However, this monstrosity of a tinny, joyless Jive Bunny medley of Abba’s greatest hits – featuring a none-more-1999 line-up that included Steps, Tina Cousins, Cleopatra, B*Witched and Billie Piper – was eventually released as a single. It reached number four in the UK music charts, possibly the most damning indictment of humanity as a species in all of history.Hey, Madonna, I take it back. This is perhaps the most awful tribute ever seen at an awards show. It’s Lady Gaga dressed as Kate McKinnon dressed as Lady Gaga dressed as David Bowie performing 20 seconds of several David Bowie songs in a performance that was co-credited to – and preceded by a commercial for – a multinational semiconductor chip manufacturer. It’s about as tasteless as a performance can get, and none of us should ever speak of it again."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/3519e95fb34c08c9f69c7b36ba4af4cfe5941e79/30_143_3470_2082/master/3470.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3561dfcf8693a8ddbf47f1dd6dae7774","title":"jacob rees mogg tells leaveeu dont join tories on my account","story":"Party needs members who run church fetes, not entryist ‘single-issue fanatics’, says MPJacob Rees-Mogg has disowned calls by Leave.EU for its backers to join the Conservative party to support him in a potential future leadership bid, warning against a takeover by single-issue “fanatics”.Leave.EU, the pro-Brexit campaign group co-founded by rightwing businessman Arron Banks, claims to have 88,000 supporters, and has urged them to “flood” the Tory party to elect a “true Brexiteer” such as Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson as the next leader.Leave.EU’s activities have prompted centrist MPs including Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan to warn about the risk of “entryism” in their party.But Rees-Mogg told the : “They’re not doing it in my name. Of course I want people to join the Conservative party, but I want them to join because they support a broad swath of values.”He said encouraging people to join up to back a single issue, or candidate, was “not a good approach to running a political party and its supporters, because entryists tend to be fanatics, as the Labour party has found”.The MP added: “What the Conservative party wants is what it’s always had, which is members who are by and large already doing things in their communities – people who are running the church fete or raising money for the RNLI.“You want being a member of the party to be a completely normal thing that sensible people do, not something that is done for one particular policy, however important that policy is. Conservatism is much broader than that.”Leave.EU is one of the groups responsible for an upsurge in campaigning activity on both sides of the heated Brexit debate, as negotiations in Brussels approach their denouement.With the hardline pro-Brexit European Research Group mobilising MPs to oppose Theresa May’s Chequers deal, there is a risk that the prime minister could face a vote of no confidence.Conservative rules say that anyone who has been a member for at least three months before a contest has a vote. Many at Westminster believe the greatest challenge for a pro-Brexit candidate such as Johnson or Rees-Mogg would not be winning over grassroots activists, but securing the support of enough MPs.Conservative MPs whittle down the field of candidates to two, in a series of secret ballots, and members then have the final say.The latest poll of Tory members by the website ConservativeHome earlier this month showed Johnson is currently the most popular candidate, with the home secretary, Sajid Javid, second and Rees-Mogg third.Some activists have called for the rules to be rewritten to enhance the role of members, but Rees-Mogg said the former foreign secretary William Hague was right to argue earlier this week that MPs should continue to have a significant say."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ccb50807fa170d0eaf015bd4e218f80d9ec1936/0_112_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e63475fc1732cfdb699cebdd386e547f","title":"offspring of neanderthal and denisovan identified for first time","story":"Discovery suggests that distinct ancient human species may have mingled and interbred happilyA small piece of bone found in a cave in Siberia has been identified as the remnant of a child whose mother was a Neanderthal and father was a Denisovan, a mysterious human ancestor that lived in the region.Researchers made the discovery when they examined DNA extracted from the bone and found that it contained chromosomes from a Neanderthal female and a Denisovan male. It is the first time that the offspring of such a coupling has been identified.“If you had asked me beforehand, I would have said we will never find this, it is like finding a needle in a haystack,” said Svante Pääbo, director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. “And then we stumbled across it. I was very surprised.”The discovery has led scientists to suspect that different groups of archaic humans, including the ancestors of people alive today, had few qualms about interbreeding when the chance arose. “I’m beginning to think that when these groups met, they were quite happy to mix with each other,” Pääbo said.Until 40,000 years ago, Eurasia was home to both groups of archaic humans with Neanderthals in the West and the elusive Denisovans in the East. Although the groups separated from each other more than 390,000 years ago, they occasionally crossed paths, and evidently got along royally when they did.One place where the groups overlapped was the Denisova cave in the Altai mountains in southern Siberia. It is here, and only here, that archaeologists found bits of bone belonging to what are now known as the Denisovans. Pieces of Neanderthal bone have also been unearthed in the cave too. That the material is so fragmented is blamed on hyenas: traces of DNA and etch marks from acid suggest at least some of the bones had passed through the animals’ stomachs before being lost in the cave sediments.In research published in the journal Nature, Viviane Slon and others in Leipzig describe how they examined a 2.5cm chunk of bone from the Denisova cave. They found that it belonged to a girl who was at least 13 years old when she died more than 50,000 years ago. But more striking was her parentage. While her mother passed on Neanderthal genes, the girl inherited Denisovan DNA from her father, who himself had a very distant Neanderthal ancestor. “This implies that when iniduals of the two groups happened to meet, they interbred, much more so than was previously thought,” Slon said.Scientists have little idea what the Denisovans looked like, but some hints have emerged. A handful of Denisovan teeth recovered from the cave are much larger than those of Neanderthals, and work that will be published soon finds that a piece of Denisovan skull is thick compared with other ancient humans. “They seem to have been very large and robust, even compared to Neanderthals,” said Pääbo. “They were probably pretty impressive.”Sharon Browning, who studies populations of ancient humans at the University of Washington, said the finding was “very intriguing.”“Finding remains from a first generation admixed inidual should be a very small probability occurrence, unless perhaps interbreeding between Neanderthals and Denisovans was not uncommon at a small number of locations, such as the Denisova cave, where the groups’ ranges overlapped,” she said.The researchers are now analysing sediment from the Denisova cave for traces of DNA that will clarify when different groups of humans sheltered in the refuge. Somewhere in the cave there might be more pieces of bone that reveal further details of the girl’s story. “Maybe we will find the parents one day,” said Pääbo."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5bb7c0848f98917544fdd32a768e6116fa63af/0_338_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84f58d38d9cc0bdfee413672dff6f937","title":"un poverty chief calls for evidence on effects of austerity in uk","story":"Philip Alston’s visit investigating extreme poverty in the UK likely to cause political row in BritainA disabled former soldier who said he is so poor that he lost 16kg (2st 7lb) due to a lack of food is among the contributors to the first United Nations investigation into extreme poverty into the UK.Alexander Tiffin, a 30-year old from the Scottish Highlands, sent a diary of his life on universal credit to Prof Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, who is coming to Britain in November.The eminent international human rights lawyer called for submissions from anyone in the UK to establish “the most significant human rights violations experienced by people living in poverty and extreme poverty in the UK”. He is interested in the impact of austerity, universal credit, the advent of computer algorithms making decisions on welfare matters, and Brexit.Anyone taking part has been asked to set out in no more than 2,500 words what is happening, where he should go and what he should look at. He has set a deadline of 14 September for submissions and academics, thinktanks and charities are among those drafting responses.The visit is set to be politically controversial. Alston conducted a similar exercise in the US earlier this year, which resulted in public clashes with the Trump administration. In the UK, he wants to know “to what extent austerity has been necessary” and its impact on public services including police, firefighting and libraries. He will also consider how Brexit might affect people living in poverty. Alston defines extreme poverty as “a lack of income, a lack of access to basic services, and social exclusion”.The government has already said in response that household incomes “have never been higher and there are 1 million fewer people living in absolute poverty than in 2010, including 300,000 children”.The Centre for Social Justice, a right-leaning thinktank founded by Iain Duncan Smith, who set up universal credit as work and pensions secretary, said it will not make a submission.“Universal credit is one of the most effective poverty-fighting tools in existence,” said Edward Davies, the head of policy. “When it is fully rolled out, hundreds of thousands more people will have a job as a result.”Tiffin’s diary of life on universal credit is among the most striking contributions so far. The wheelchair user told Alston he is living off £95.35 a fortnight in universal credit payments and that after paying for his electricity and gas, fuel for his adapted car, broadband connection, TV licence and baby milk for his youngest son, he is left with £10.50 for two weeks.“At one time in February, I had no food at all for two weeks,” he wrote. “I probably ate on less than a quarter of the days in that month. I just had nothing. I lost two and a half stone … my hair has started falling out and my teeth are loose due to a lack of vitamin intake.”Tiffin has suffered from mental health problems. He is a Muslim convert and was recently admonished by a court for threatening to kill unbelievers. Police considered he was “an idiot” rather than a terrorist and he was not punished. He said the incident occurred when he was going through a complete breakdown. Human Rights Watch, an organisation more often associated with defending rights in countries such as Russia, China, Syria, and India, is planning to tell Alston about food poverty in the UK.“There is a lot of hunger that goes under the radar, ranging from parents skipping meals, kids showing up to school hungry, and schools and families relying on low-cost, redistributed surplus food to make ends meet,” said Kartik Raj, a HRW researcher for western Europe. “People have a right to food and an adequate standard of living. These are human rights the government is obliged to ensure under international treaties it has signed. If the fifth largest economy in the world is failing to ensure that basic minimum, or letting things get worse, particularly for those who are least well off, then that is certainly something we will be bringing to the rapporteur’s attention.”“Destitution cuts off your ability to have a decent life and affects mental and physical health and the opportunities for you and your children in the future,” said Chris Goulden, a deputy director of the JRF.Aoife Nolan, a professor of international human rights law at the University of Nottingham, said: “The key issue he has to come and see is welfare reform, deliberate actions which have negatively impacted the enjoyment of human rights for disabled people and children in particular.”The right to an adequate standard of living is enshrined in the UN convention on the rights of the child and, Nolan said, it is being breached because these rights were not being extended as they should and minimum thresholds are being breached.The government has said it is its policy to accept and facilitate visits by UN rapporteurs."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/36a390d4942d6d2b42bbb94f65f6e31d5cad0954/0_198_2036_1221/master/2036.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0664c438dde1c2e5e28aef7f0fb12312","title":"andrew heffernan hull kr concussion","story":"Hull KR’s Australian centre Andrew Heffernan has been released from his contract and is set to take a 12-month break from the game to continue his recovery from a long-standing concussion.The former Penrith player has not played for the Robins since early April when the latest in a series of head knocks forced him from the field in the victory over Widnes, with specialists later advising him not to play again this season.However, having still experienced symptoms while training and in his day-to-day life, the 23-year-old has made the decision to return to Australia and focus on his long-term health.Heffernan scored 20 tries in 31 appearances for the Robins and was named the club’s young player of the year and community clubman in his debut season in their promotion-winning campaign in 2017.“Since my last concussion back in April I’ve seen a number of specialists and I’ve worked through a rehabilitation programme,” Heffernan told Hull KR TV. “It took a long time to work out exactly what was going wrong but we were able to pinpoint it and we found out that, while my brain and cognitive function was working well, I had some damage to my vestibular system.“This continues to give me some symptoms during my day-to-day activities so I’m just working through that at the moment and building up gradually.“It was a very tough decision but I came to the realisation that I had to focus on my health for this next period. It’s been the most difficult injury that I’ve had. I’ve had some shoulders done and other injuries throughout my career but because it was affecting me day-to-day, and still continues to, it makes it a very difficult injury.“Globally I don’t think we have the best understanding of concussion yet. We’re still learning about it and hopefully I can use my experience to help other players moving forward and that’s what I’ve tried to do both at the club and at the RFL.”The Hull KR coach, Tim Sheens, said: “We are sorry to see Heff leave the club and return home to Australia to be closer to his partner and his family but we are fully understanding and supportive of his decision.”"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/901c591a959bf0a447d15152ba93856526d1c50e/388_100_2612_1567/master/2612.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a463c0b191da1b6039d89ecb8721e11a","title":"james vince england recall india jonny bairstow","story":"James Vince could return to England’s plans for the fourth Test on his home ground at Southampton next week following the 203-run defeat by India that left Jonny Bairstow nursing a broken finger and the captain, Joe Root, lamenting his batsmen.England will name their squad on Thursday and Bairstow, who sustained the hairline crack to his left middle finger while keeping wicket on Monday, may yet be included as a specialist batsman. Vince would thus be cover, with Jos\u0026nbspButtler expected to take the gloves regardless.Ed Smith, the national selector, dropped the Hampshire captain from his first squad this summer and the return of a player averaging 24.9 from 13 Tests will not worry India unduly. The tourists are buoyant after requiring only 17 balls on the final morning in Nottingham to claim the final wicket and cut England’s lead to 2-1 with two to play.Despite ruing a second-day meltdown with the bat in which 10 wickets were lost in a session and ultimately with it the Test, Root said: “We’re definitely in the driving seat as far as the series goes. We have to keep remembering that.”It is clear that while there is a glut of batsmen queuing up for spots from five to eight, the top order is not working. And while Keaton Jennings is short of runs during his second spell in the side, there are also questions resurfacing over Alastair Cook’s longevity after just one half-century in\u0026nbsp14 innings this year for the 33‑year‑old opener.Cook, who made 29 and 17 in Nottingham, has been feast or famine over the past 12 months, registering an unbeaten 244 in Melbourne during the winter’s Ashes defeat and 243 against West Indies last summer but offering little in between.Root said: “The hardest point to bat is opening. He’s a world-class performer, he’s proven that time and time again and actually I’d like you to write him off because every time he’s written off he comes back and scores a double hundred.“You never really know what someone is thinking. But the way he speaks on the field, the way he speaks to the batters around the group and offers his experience, it doesn’t look like someone who is thinking about jacking it in.”There is a small complication as regards Cook’s immediate future with his wife, Alice, expecting their third child some time around the fourth and fifth Test. Root, while noting such things “are not an exact science”, said the selectors would consider the left‑hander available but “play it by ear”.The return of Vince, who averages 56 in Division One this summer and made scores of 74 and 147 for Hampshire in their win against Nottinghamshire at the Ageas Bowl this week, would allow Root to drop down to his preferred No\u0026nbsp4 position and move Pope away from the newer ball.That said, the latter could make way for Moeen Ali, fresh from a double century and eight wickets for Worcestershire at Scarborough, should the pitch call for two spinners. It all hinges on whether Bairstow, who is said to able to grip the bat unimpeded, is deemed worth risking, even if Buttler appears certain to keep wicket.Root said: “Jonny is obviously a world-class batter in good form and would warrant his place within the side as a batter. In terms of keeping, we are very fortunate to have Jos in the team already. It would make things very easy in terms of him stepping into that role.”On his own scores of 16 and 13, the England captain said: “I don’t feel as though I’m Bambi on ice or anything. I’m determined to get things right but you’ve got to earn the right, get in and lay a platform to make a big score. I don’t think I’m far away.”As regards his team’s overall performance in Nottingham, Root laid the blame squarely on their batting and added that to explore other issues would be “nit-picking” (despite catching remaining a significant problem). He pointed to Buttler’s maiden Test century in a second-innings stand of 169 with Ben Stokes as the template, as well as his opposite number, Virat Kohli, making 200 runs for the second time this series.England, meanwhile, confirmed that Buttler and Jennings are clear to play for Lancashire in their T20 Blast quarter-final at Kent on Thursday while Moeen can turn out for Worcestershire in their home tie against Gloucestershire on Saturday. Stokes, who has reported a niggle in his left knee but is not considered a doubt for the next Test, is rested from Durham’s hosting of Sussex on Friday."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/4687d0f783d1709041edb9616812fd92d4dadcac/1_137_1874_1124/master/1874.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6199845f78d582c07f91a406000ad814","title":"lewis hamilton sebastian vettel formula one championship run in","story":"Formula One returns to action in Spa this weekend after an unprecedented volume of contract activity during the summer break. Yet much serious business is far from settled – especially for the title protagonists, Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, who begin a championship run-in likely to be decided by the finest of margins.After Hamilton won in Hungary the curtain fell on a demanding first half of the season. At the time there were many ongoing driver negotiations but little was anticipated in terms of actual movement over the break. Five days later Daniel Ricciardo made the shock announcement that he would not, as had been expected, re-sign with Red Bull but was to join Renault for 2019.The Australian cited the desire for a new challenge but factors such as a lack of faith in Honda’s power unit for next season, his desire to be an undisputed No\u0026nbsp1 driver and even perhaps Renault convincing him that their works team have championship-winning material in the pipeline, are all likely to have played their part. His move opened the floodgates.Fernando Alonso then made his less unexpected statement that he was to leave F1 at the end of the 2018 season after 17 years in the sport, although he remains open to returning should McLaren make their way back to the front of the grid. Alonso will be greatly missed but, with the Indy\u0026nbsp500 now his target and McLaren way off the pace, it was only a matter of time before he walked. With the market thrown open by Ricciardo, McLaren had to move and two days later announced they had signed Renault’s Carlos Sainz for 2019.Red Bull, too, now had a seat available and they opted to stick with their method of promoting from within the ranks, taking Pierre Gasly from their sister team Toro Rosso for next season. Gasly celebrated, he said, by running round shouting in his pants before jumping into a swimming pool. A pleasingly enthusiastic response but Red Bull also know he is a strong asset. He brings knowledge of Honda’s power unit and this season where it has been strongest Gasly has delivered exceptionally well – fourth in Bahrain, seventh in Monaco and sixth in Hungary.All of which had been preceded by the news that Force India had been saved from administration by a consortium led by the Williams driver Lance Stroll’s father, Lawrence. This was superb for the team, who have outperformed better-funded rivals and deserve to race on – but it further complicates the driver market. Stroll is almost certain to take his son to Force India, who are also likely to retain Sergio Pérez, leaving the Mercedes junior Esteban Ocon without a drive. He is now a contender to replace Stoffel Vandoorne at McLaren but they are also considering their junior Lando Norris, who will drive in his first Grand Prix weekend in FP1 at Spa. Williams in turn will have a seat open and a big Stroll-shaped hole in their finances.Deals are still to be done then but at the sharp end these are the distant sounds of musical chairs, not a distraction for Hamilton and Vettel, embroiled in a fight as tight as either driver has yet encountered. Hamilton’s win over Vettel in Hungary, after his victory from 14th in Germany, has given him a 24-point lead over his rival. It is the greatest advantage either driver has held all season but is not indicative of how competitive their battle has been.The Mercedes and Ferrari are remarkably closely matched and, with the Scuderia making a real step forward this season in power, the advantage Mercedes previously enjoyed on grunt‑dependent tracks has all but disappeared. Indeed, what the opening 12 races have indicated is that this title will be decided by the men behind the wheel and their team more than machinery.The Mercedes technical director, James Allison, pointed out after Hungary that only five races had been won by what was the fastest car and seven had gone against the head. “Small differences, maybe an error, maybe a moment of particular genius, or just sheer good fortune or ill fortune is what is determining who comes home smiling at the end of the race,” he said.Luck, then, will play a part, as it did with the VSC and safety car in Australia and China. So will strategic calls, as Mercedes found to their cost in Melbourne, Shanghai and Austria, and both teams will require a bulletproof mechanical performance. Given all those factors so far and that Ferrari are now quicker in a straight line than Mercedes and hold an advantage through the slow corners, Vettel would have expected to be leading after Hockenheim and Budapest.But in Germany his “off” in the rain cost him dearly while Hamilton’s superb drive there and his brilliant pole in the wet at the Hungaroring proved vital. As things stand, it is the drivers who look to be the crucial differentiator. Both are settled with their contracts and the next nine meetings will prove which one has really earned all those zeroes to claim a fifth title."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/e425ddde9e95882bc9511659d854eba485a5411b/6_308_3887_2331/master/3887.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89f0d2f689e99a8c63e513fe47dba67b","title":"oisin murphy roaring lion wins juddmonte international stakes york","story":"At the start of July Oisin Murphy was still looking for his first win in a British Group One. Less than two months later he has three to his name and the latest success, aboard Roaring Lion in the Juddmonte International Stakes here on Wednesday, showed that in addition to his horsemanship, judgment and guile, Murphy has now developed the invaluable habit of being in the right place at precisely the right time.Poet’s Word, the King George winner at Ascot last month, was the 8-5 favourite for what promised to be one of the best races of the season with Roaring Lion, who broke Murphy’s Group One duck in Britain in the Eclipse Stakes in July, next in at 3-1. Most the punters on the Knavesmire were on one of the pair and, while the bare form of Roaring Lion’s three-and-a-quarter-length defeat of Poet’s Word looks comprehensive, the favourite’s backers will have headed home with a nagging feeling that on another day it might have been different.As the field turned for home behind Thunder Snow, the Dubai World Cup winner James Doyle on Poet’s Word was nicely positioned behind the leaders with all his\u0026nbspoptions still open. But then Christophe Soumillon, on Thunder Snow, led the runners all the way across to the stands’ rail and suddenly, unavoidably, Doyle found himself stuck behind runners.Doyle was briefly short of room three furlongs out and then had to sit and wait for running room before switching left to launch a challenge. Murphy, by contrast, had been left ideally placed by the move to the stands side and had already picked his moment to strike for home. Poet’s Word set off in pursuit but Roaring Lion stayed on strongly to the line as Thundering Blue, a 50-1 outsider, came through to finish third.The favourite’s poor luck in running should not detract from yet another step forward by Roaring Lion, whose season opened with a bitterly disappointing defeat at odds-on in the Craven Stakes. Masar, the winner that day, beat him again a few weeks later but this time it was by only two lengths – and in the Derby at Epsom. Roaring Lion’s two subsequent runs have both yielded Group One wins with the promise of more to come.An imminent rematch between Roaring Lion and Poet’s Word seems unlikely as the winner is expected to head to the Irish Champion Stakes in September, a race that Sir Michael Stoute to all intents ruled out for Poet’s\u0026nbspWord.“James said it was very messy,” Stoute, trainer of Poet’s Word’s, said. “We thought we were in a good position turning in, and then we were in the worst position – and the winner had gone when we were getting reorganised. The Irish Champion Stakes wouldn’t be a possibility. I don’t know where we’ll go now. Why should I know? It’s\u0026nbsptoo early. He’s in everything he could be in.”Charlie Appleby saddled the first two home in the Great Voltigeur Stakes and will send Old Persian, the winner, to the St Leger at Doncaster next month while Cross Counter will continue on the path towards the Melbourne Cup at Flemington Park in November.“I think we have a nice team going to Australia but it depends on how they travel,” Appleby said. “That’s their biggest challenge. If they turn up as they would on this side of the water, they are going to be big players.”Tips by Greg Wood"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/662ddcff4a4d3b21e958a66a5780a99353612311/0_142_2631_1579/master/2631.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fccdf7513c5844332f58730b90b3eacf","title":"andy murray ivan lendl alexander zverev us open","story":"When Andy Murray hooked up with Ivan Lendl seven years ago, he seemed convinced that, after several experiments with other coaches, he and old Rock Jaw would be together for the rest of his career. Within a year, he had broken through for an Olympic gold medal and his first grand slam title at the US\u0026nbspOpen. Two Wimbledon titles would follow – then injury, struggle and no little angst.When Murray arrived this week in New York to prepare for the US\u0026nbspOpen, the last major of the season, he may have experienced a shiver of regret, or nostalgia maybe, when he learned Lendl had come out of retirement to tend to the development of the exciting young German Alexander Zverev. Murray would hardly be human if he did not at least wonder how it may have panned out during his own difficult stretches had Lendl not walked away – twice.Lendl and Murray long ago put their emotional split to one side. The coach went off to play a lot of golf and the player found contentment with his old friend, Jamie Delgado, who has bolstered his long‑time back‑up team. He has new challenges now. Murray is 31, still managing the drawn out recovery of his chronic hip pain and looking up the rankings rather than down, at 378 in the world, as the 21-year-old Zverev consolidates his position near the top of the game at No\u0026nbsp4.Zverev has promised a lot – three Masters titles – without grabbing the biggest prize but he has the game to scare everyone in the field. It would be a disappointment if he did not reach the final weekend for Murray, getting into the second week would be a considerable achievement.Were the unseeded Murray and fancied Zverev to meet in the first round, it would be a collision even more electric than when the former world No\u0026nbsp1 beat Tomas Berdych in the 2015 Australian Open semi-final. That night his wife, Kim, swore dutifully in his defence as Murray’s former mentor, Dani Vallverdu, sat in the Czech’s box. What added spice to the occasion was the fact Berdych had tapped up Lendl to coach him, only to be turned down.So much has changed since then for all of them. Berdych (who made up with Murray) is not here this year, out injured again at the tail end of his career. Murray, places below Dan Evans in the rankings, is flying so far under the radar that Roger Federer did not mention the three-times grand slam champion when discussing whom he regarded as the main contenders.As Federer sees it in the first grand slam tournament featuring the big four since Wimbledon 2017, the defending champion and No\u0026nbsp1 seed Rafael Nadal, and the former champion Novak Djokovic, who beat the Swiss in the Cincinnati Open final, are the two to beat. He does not sound that confident about his own game, which soared and dipped during the warm-up tournament before his bankable return of serve collapsed against Djokovic on Sunday.Murray returns to New York an almost invisible champion, which may be the way he prefers it. Since his return from injury this summer, he has struggled to assert himself. When he looked to have conquered his own misgivings about his fitness, he then faltered on the eve of Wimbledon, unconvinced he could survive a five-set match.He still is not sure if he can – which is why he should have played there, although he is convinced he made the right decision. After winning a few matches on grass, Murray has had tough examinations in Washington – where he withdrew after winning three matches – and in Cincinnati, where Lucas Pouille was too good for him in the first round.Djokovic, who limped away from Wimbledon with Murray in the quarter-finals in 2017, has been considerably rejuvenated since winning there on his return this summer, then in Cincinnati. When Nadal, perennially worried about his knees and hip, decided to skip Cincinnati to get ready for Flushing Meadows he sent out a signal of doubt Djokovic will surely start favourite.The British have not had many successes in New York since they beat George Washington in 1776, and this year may be little different. Kyle Edmund is the only seed, at 16. Johanna Konta, who has fallen from four in the world a year ago to 46, is the only other British player in the tournament by right – and she pulled out of the Connecticut Open this week with a virus.Edmund, though, is on an upswing. Bjorn Borg, no less, celebrated his addition to Team Europe for the three-day Laver Cup in Chicago in late September with some glowing words. “Kyle is an outstanding young player who’s achieved some great results and big wins over top players,” he said. “I’m impressed with his meticulous and methodical approach to the sport and believe he will be a great fit with the team.”Europe, with Federer, Djokovic and Edmund on board, should be too strong for the weirdly named Team World – even without Nadal.The Spaniard declared as long ago as June he was making the Davis Cup semi-final against France the week before a priority over the fledgling Laver Cup, the Ryder Cup-style brainchild of Federer in honour of Rod Laver.This is the face of modern tennis towards the end of an intriguing summer: iniduals torn between personal glory (and money) and national obligations. With the ATP’s own team competition slated to start in 2020, it will only become more complicated."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/692b8df040a697df4909df4647405bb9a37e62fe/0_0_4263_2558/master/4263.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3957d943a4eeac0af238e0790b40764c","title":"samsung galaxy note 9 review phone bluetooth s pen","story":"The phablet’s massive, beautiful screen, excellent performance and new Bluetooth stylus will have Note fans salivatingThe king of the big, powerful phones is back for another generation, but is the new Samsung Galaxy Note 9 still the phablet to beat?The Note series pioneered the big-screen smartphone in 2011 and over the last seven years it has been made larger and more feature-packed with each new version. Where the Galaxy S9 series is Samsung’s top-end phone for normal people, the Note 9 is the powerhouse for those that need the answer to the question “can I do that on my phone” always to be yes.The Note 9’s screen is big - at 6.4in it’s 0.1in bigger than the last version – but it’s only actually a smidgen larger than that fitted to the Galaxy S9+.Place the new phone next to the Note 8 and you’d be hard pressed to tell the difference, until you look a bit more closely. The bezels are slightly smaller and the aluminium band around the sides slightly more prominent. The dual-camera system now sits slightly proud of the glass back and the fingerprint scanner has been moved from alongside the cameras to below them. It’s a tiny change but makes a huge difference for usability.The screen is the best you can get on a smartphone, with bright, bold colours, inky blacks and great viewing angles. The Note has always been Samsung’s showcase for its best screen technology.The massive screen does have its downsides, though, as it makes the Note 9 fairly difficult to handle without two hands. If any phone would benefit from a ring or finger grip on the back, this is it. Samsung should have included a hand strap like the ones that came with phones in the early 2000s. It could sit next to the headphone jack.Like the Galaxy S9, the Note 9 has a different processor, depending on where you buy it. The European model has Samsung’s own Exynos 9810 chip and was the version tested, while the North American model has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 processor, which is used in the OnePlus 6 and other top-end phones released in 2018. Performance should be similar between the two versions, although there may be discrepancies at the extremes.The Note 9 is arguably the best performing Android device on the market, and is capable of maintaining that maximum performance for much longer without overheating, which was very noticeable in Shadowgun Legends compared with a Pixel 2XL or OnePlus 6.That was while using the Note 9 as my primary device with the always-on display active, while browsing and using apps for five hours with well over a hundred notifications, reading comics in Marvel Unlimited for 60 minutes, and listening to about five hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.For comparison, Huawei’s 6in Mate 10 Pro can last two full days between charges under similar conditions. It’s possible that the North American version of the Note 9 with the Qualcomm processor may have longer battery life.The Note 9 runs the latest version of Samsung’s modified Android called Samsung Experience 9.5. It’s based on Android 8.1 Oreo instead of the recently released Android 9 Pie, which is disappointing but not entirely unexpected.It looks and behaves similarly to the Note 8 or Galaxy S9+ with Samsung Experience 9. There are a few useful additions for the stylus and large screen, such as the pop-out Edge apps, advanced split-screen multitasking and the ability to pop-out apps to run as windows over others – all features present in the Note 8.On the whole the software on the Note 9 feels like Samsung’s best optimised yet, with smoother performance all round. It’s not quite as snappy as a OnePlus 6 or Google’s Pixel 2XL, but it feels as if Samsung has done a better job of limiting lag all over the system.The dual-camera system on the back is the same as that fitted to the Galaxy S9+. Two 12-megapixel cameras, one wide angle with dual aperture and the other a 2x telephoto camera.New for the Note 9 is an AI system for optimising scenes for shots, which worked fine when it recognised objects such as food and plants, but often created oversaturated images that look like they’ve been put through an Instagram filters. I turned it off and got better results. The AI is also meant to spot when the image is blurry or your subject has their eyes closed, but I couldn’t get it to alert me no matter how many shots of friends blinking I took.Lacklustre AI elements aside, the camera is brilliant, capturing a rich amount of detail, even with the telephoto lens, and in a range of lighting conditions. Low light performance was excellent too, as was the 8-megapixel selfie camera.Another new addition is a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen, which uses a supercapacitor to operate the S Pen away from the phone for up to 30 minutes or so. Slide the S Pen back into the body for a full charge in 40 seconds.Other than the usual scribbling on screen, you can now press the button to trigger actions on your phone, such as taking a picture in the camera app, pausing music or presenting the next slide in PowerPoint. Hold down the button and you can launch an app too.I didn’t find it overly useful, but I know that the feature has been on the wish lists of Note users for some time.If you need your phone to be able to do just about anything, the Note 9 is it. It has everything and the kitchen sink wrapped up into a massive powerhouse of a phone.As you might expect that comes with a few compromises, the biggest of which is the sheer size of the thing making it quite difficult to pocket and handle. It also costs a lot, although not quite as much as Apple’s significantly smaller iPhone X.The camera is great, the screen is amazing, the stylus useful and the myriad features don’t get in the way if you don’t use all of them. You can game for longer at maximum performance than other phones and even use it as a workable light desktop when hooked up to a monitor.The battery life is good but should be better given the size of the cell, and launching after the release of a new version of Android 9 Pie but running last year’s 8.1 Oreo isn’t ideal.The Note 9 really isn’t that much different than the Note 8, but is a huge step forward over older models. Note fans should be happy.Pros: good battery, impressive screen, water resistant, brilliant camera, Bluetooth S Pen, microSD card slot, wireless charging, lasting performance, DeX without the dock, headphone jackCons: only Android 8.1, expensive, very big for hands and pockets, fingerprint scanner should be lower down the back, Bixby still not good enough This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

He said Trump repaid him for the $130,000 in hush money received by Daniels.“He said under oath the most damaging, definitive information yesterday – that the president of the United States directed him to commit a crime,” Davis said on NBC’s Today show.Davis also said Cohen would not accept a pardon, even if Trump were to offer him one.“Not only is he not hoping for, he would not accept a pardon,” Davis said.“He considers a pardon from somebody who has acted so corruptly as president to be something he would never accept.”On Wednesday, Trump praised praised Manafort, saying he was “brave” and had “tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Cohen, he refused to ‘break’”.He also sought to downplay Cohen’s admissions, and attempted to dismiss two of the counts of campaign finance violations that Cohen had pleaded guilty to, saying they “are not a crime”.He elaborated during an interview with the conservative network Fox News, which is due to be broadcast on Thursday. Asked if he knew about the payments, Trump said: “They didn’t come out of the campaign, they came from me. And I tweeted about it. You know, I put – I don’t know if you know but I tweeted about the payments. But they didn’t come out of the campaign.“But they weren’t – that’s not a – it’s not even a campaign violation. If you look at President Obama, he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general and they viewed it a lot differently.”Trump was apparently referring to a fine levied on the former president’s 2008 campaign over missing and delayed disclosure of high-dollar donors in the final days of that race.Though Cohen’s plea deal did not include an agreement to cooperate with prosecutors, his lawyer said Cohen was prepared to tell all to the special counsel’s investigators and to the public.“What he knows that he witnessed will be of interest to the special counsel,” he said on ABC’s Good Morning America. “He will tell the truth to everyone who asks him about Mr Trump.”Cohen was for years one of Trump’s most trusted advisers, but his attorney made it clear he has thoroughly turned on his billionaire boss, less than a year after he said he “would take a bullet for” the president.Cohen believes Trump is “unsuitable to hold the office”, Davis said, citing his refusal while standing alongside Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, to accept the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that the Russians were responsible for the election disruption.The distaste is apparently mutual. In his first comment on Cohen’s plea, Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning: “If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!”At the White House briefing later in the day, the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, declined to rule out the possibility that Manafort might receive a presidential pardon. She insisted: “Just because Michael Cohen made a plea deal doesn’t mean that implicates the president in anything.”Asked if the president lied to the American people about the payments, Sanders replied: “That’s a ridiculous accusation. The president in this matter has done nothing wrong and there are no charges against him.”But there has been sharp criticism from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill. The Democratic leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, said the cases were “further evidence of the rampant corruption and criminality at the heart of Trump’s inner circle.“Cohen’s admission of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in hush money ‘at the direction of the candidate’ to influence the 2016 election shows the president’s claims of ignorance to be far from accurate, and places him in even greater legal jeopardy.The Republican senator Ben Sasse said: “Paul Manafort is a founding member of the DC swamp and Michael Cohen is the Gotham version of the same. Neither one of these felons should have been anywhere near the presidency.”"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/108331699685d36d795d961d007e686a3cdde62f/0_0_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3c09aa6b9820376d9dc69ee802e303f","title":"my ivf life lupron transfer results","story":"Following the estrogen patches, the progesterone shots, the transfer, and an anxious wait, I finally find out if I’m pregnantA month before the transfer – which is to say, the procedure in which my doctor will place an embryo in my uterus in the hopes that it will implant and grow into a baby – E and I go away for an early-March weekend in western Massachusetts. I call it our IVF-moon: we know that the regime we’re embarking on will keep us fairly homebound. I’m already on two medications to start preparing my body for potential pregnancy, and soon we’ll add more.We’re visiting an art gallery in a high-ceilinged former factory building and I can’t believe the temperature. I start removing my layers.How on earth can they afford to heat the building like this? I ask E, peeling off my coat and sweater and flannel shirt until I’m down to a clammy T-shirt, and why is everyone else in this gallery still wearing coats indoors?He looks at me like I’m talking nonsense. He’s also wearing his coat.Oh my God, I say, I’m having a hot flash.Thanks to the drugs, I am in (temporary) menopause. The cause of the menopause is Lupron, which is injected into my stomach every night for two weeks with a skinny needle. I’m also wearing estrogen patches, to build up my uterine lining. Once the Lupron stops I move on to the dreaded progesterone in oil: dreaded because it’s viscous and requires a giant needle and nightly shots in the buttocks that cause huge welts and sometimes bleeding. Progesterone in oil is also hard to come by: there’s a nationwide shortage, so even though I have the tremendous privilege of health insurance that covers much of the cost, we’re sent scrambling for more when the mail-order pharmacy can’t fulfill the full order when we need it, which means E has to go pick up extra to fill in the gaps at a cost of $100 per vial. E has to pick the progesterone up because I am somewhat inert. Progesterone side-effects mimic the symptoms of early pregnancy, so I am tired and achy and hungry and lying on the couch whenever possible. I nearly pass out in the midst of a workout, and that’s the end of my attendance at the gym. We’ve now been in the IVF process for nearly six months, and I miss feeling like myself.E comes with me on the day of the transfer, but they don’t let him come in the operating room – he’s not sterile. I change into a hospital gown everyone else in the room is wearing hazmat suits.You don’t want to know the sex, right? says my doctor.No, I say. E and I have discussed this: though the information is there in the file – they identify the sex when sequencing the chromosomes for the other genetic tests – we know that imagining the embryo as a boy or a girl will make us feel a little bit more attached. I’m trying not to feel attached. Someone puts a photo of the embryo on a screen that I can see while I’m lying back on the procedure table: a grey blob of cells. I remember not to get attached.The transfer feels anticlimatic: a quick pinch and it’s done. I’m rolled back into a recovery area and told to lie still for 20 minutes or so, but there’s not much to recover from. They give me a print of the blob photo and I show it to E. We discuss whether it resembles us. I take a picture with my phone and send it to my mother.Isn’t is amazing, she says, that your dad and I are partly in there?It is, I say. It is amazing.And now: we wait. In IVF-parlance it’s known as the two-week wait, though in my case it will be more like 10 days until I return to the clinic for a blood test that will look for HCG – pregnancy hormone – in my blood. If it’s there, I’ll be four weeks pregnant.The only thing you can do during the two-week wait besides, well, waiting, is to take home pregnancy tests. E and I discuss it and I agree not to take one, because of the risk of false results. And then I think about taking one every day. Would it be so bad for me take one? I go into drugstores to look at pregnancy tests on the shelves, to scratch the itch, and then two nights before my blood test I go to a Duane Reade and buy a three-pack and take it home and leave it on the bathroom counter. This makes me feel a little bit more in control.What’s this? says E when he sees it.I didn’t take it, I say, but I wanted to.The blood test is scheduled early on a Saturday morning. I make E come with me, because I’m so anxious, but it’s an anticlimax, too: a quick stick, and then over. We’d planned to go out for breakfast afterwards, but we’re anxious, not hungry. We take the hour-long train back to Brooklyn, take the dog for a walk, go back to sleep for a bit. I stare at my phone. The minutes drag. E makes us some lunch out of random leftovers and we are sitting eating it on the front stoop when my phone lights up with the number of the hospital.Congratulations, says the nurse at the other end of the line. You’re pregnant.My HCG number is not huge, but it’s enough. The nurse tells me to come back in a couple of days for another test to see if it’s rising it needs to double each day.Thank you, I say.E and I put down our food and clutch each other. We blink in the sunlight. We look at the picture of the blob on my phone. There’s so much that could still go wrong, but it could be the first photo of our baby. I allow myself to take the print that the doctor gave me and hang it, with a magnet, on the fridge.This week I learned: HCG is the hormone that home pregnancy tests detect, but a blood test can determine exactly what your level of HCG is, which can be one indicator of the likelihood that a pregnancy is viable."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff5ceaae8d345395f93d811791dafea1e02b5cc/0_192_5756_3453/master/5756.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df65d2f914bd39a05fc620987b367a42","title":"us ready to drive iranian oil exports to zero says us national security adviser","story":"Donald’s Trump’s sanctions would drive Iranian oil exports down in order to force behaviour change on Tehran regimeThe US is prepared to use sanctions to drive Iranian oil exports down to zero, the US national security adviser, John Bolton, has said.“Regime change in Iran is not American policy, but what we want is massive change in the regime’s behaviour,” Bolton said on a visit to Israel, as he claimed current sanctions had been more effective than predicted.Donald Trump took the US out of Iran’s nuclear deal with the west in May and is imposing escalating sanctions, both to force Iran to renegotiate the deal and to end Tehran’s perceived interference in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.Bolton was speaking as the new UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, met the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, for the first time in Washington to discuss how to reduce Iranian influence, despite Britain’s continued support for the nuclear deal.In an interview with Axios, a US political website, Hunt praised Trump’s willingness to talk with leaders deemed to be hostile to the US, denying he was an isolationist. Trump has already met the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and has even hinted at talks with the Iranian leadership.Hunt is maintaining UK support for the deal signed in 2015, and according to Iran, the UK has even stepped in to advise Tehran on how to remain compliant with the deal by limiting plutonium from one of its heavy nuclear reactors.Hunt has suggested the existing level of US sanctions already has the potential to change Iran’s “destabilising regional behaviour”, but additional pressure that led Iran to pull out of the nuclear deal completely might lead only to a more dangerous anti-western government being installed in Tehran.Hunt stressed that the UK would not withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal, but acknowledged it was an open question whether Tehran would decide if the remaining economic benefits warranted remaining inside the deal. Sweeping US secondary sanctions on businesses that trade with Iran make it difficult for European governments to persuade EU companies it is worth the risk of continuing to do business with the country.Bolton was bullish about the growing impact of sanctions. “We expect that Europeans will see, as businesses all over Europe are seeing, that the choice between doing business with Iran or doing business with the United States is very clear to them,” he said.British officials acknowledge that the US administration policy for the moment has secured Trump the best of both worlds – Iranian refusal to restart its nuclear programme due the EU’s continued support for the deal, and the imposition of a regime of secondary economic sanctions that is placing great pressure on the Iranian economy.Fuller US sanctions, including actions against countries that trade in Iranian oil are due to come into force on 5 November, 180 days after the initial Trump announcement to withdraw.The measures against Iranian oil importers, and banks that continue to trade with the Central Bank of Iran, will ratchet the pressure to a higher level.Pompeo has set up an Iran Action group inside the US State Department to coordinate US leverage on companies and countries that cannot show that their trade, including in oil, has fallen significantly by November.Measures may also be taken against firms that insure ships carrying Iranian crude.It is expected some of the major Iranian oil importers, such as Russia, China and Turkey, will either ignore the threat of US sanctions, or, possibly in the case of Iraq, Japan and South Korea, seek exemptions.China takes a quarter of all Iran’s oil exports, and with Chinese banks little exposed to the US it can avoid the impact of Trump’s sanctions.Major importers of Iranian crude in Europe include Italy’s ENI and Saras, Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total, and Greece’s Hellenic Petroleum. All these companies depend on access to US dollar financing and US suppliers, and most have significant operations in the US.The EU in August introduced a blocking statute designed to give European firms immunity from US sanctions for trading with Iran. But its legal force is questionable since it requires EU firms to sue the US government for any losses caused by US sanctions. The statute is untested in court.EU foreign ministers will meet at the end of the month to discuss the measures they have taken to protect the deal.Iran’s foreign minister, Javed Zarif, this week demanded clearer practical steps from Europe to protect the deal, saying: “Europeans have been very good in declaring their positions, but to pay that price they need to make a decision and they have only a limited time for that decision and cannot wait for ever.”The German foreign minister, Heiko Maase, in an article in the German business daily, Handelsblatt, on Wednesday called for the EU to protect itself from secondary sanctions by increasing its autonomy from the US financial system. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she agreed with her foreign minister that relations with the US were changing but she stopped short of backing his call for a separate EU system for cross-border payments system to save the nuclear deal with Iran."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfd448ae3ec840dda2e638f0374ef2d68c697c93/0_132_2954_1772/master/2954.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73d4e4b92875535727c028cd5343df60","title":"china ejects us journalist known for reporting on xinjiang repression","story":"Foreign correspondents condemn decision to deny visa to Megha Rajagopalan China has “effectively ejected” an American journalist from the country, a journalists’ association has said, after she won a reputation for hard-hitting reporting on the country’s troubled western Xinjiang region.Megha Rajagopalan, a correspondent for BuzzFeed, wrote on Twitter that she would be moving on to another beat after the foreign ministry in Beijing “declined to issue a new visa”.The decision to deny her a visa was condemned by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC). “We are attempting to get clarity from the foreign ministry on its reasoning for effectively ejecting a credentialed foreign journalist,” it said in a statement.“We find this extremely regrettable and unacceptable for a government that repeatedly insists it welcomes foreign media to cover the country.”Rajagopalan, a former board member, had “conducted herself according to the highest journalistic standards while in China”, the organisation said.China has previously delayed visas, or refused to renew them, for inidual correspondents or media outlets that have angered the government with their coverage.In 2012 a reporter for al-Jazeera English was refused a visa renewal, prompting the broadcaster to shutter its China bureau. In 2015 a correspondent for France’s L’Obs magazine was also forced to leave, after writing a critical report on Beijing’s policies in Xinjiang.The foreign ministry said Ursula Gauthier’s article in current affairs magazine L’Obs, “openly supports terrorist activity, the killing of innocents and has outraged the Chinese public”.Several reporters for the New York Times were also refused visas, in the years after a 2012 story on the wealth of the family of the former premier Wen Jiabao.Rajagopalan had been recognised, by her peers and with press awards, for extensive and in-depth reporting on mounting surveillance and repression in Xinjiang.She did not directly accuse the Chinese government of expelling her for coverage of Xinjiang, saying the ministry told BuzzFeed it was a procedural issue. But she also noted that she would continue to cover developments in the region from a distance.“I also want to make clear that though I can’t do it from inside China any more, I’m not going to stop reporting on and speaking about state surveillance, repression and incarceration of millions of Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang,” she said on Twitter.The foreign ministry said only that it handed visas “according to laws and regulations”, the Associated Press reported."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/573d410a394ea84f3fe08740f3f91addf8403268/0_0_4560_2736/master/4560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02b19602876d420979274639bbc9e0be","title":"reunions of a lifetime as south koreans head north in pictures","story":"Almost 90 families have met for the first time since becoming separated by the Korean war nearly 70 years ago.

The transport company issues refunds to those who seek them from its head office. Its decision to no longer do so, announced on Wednesday, is part of a move toward a “cashless” service, it said, and encouraged people to buy Leap cards to pay for journeys. It said the amount of change reclaimed by customers has continued to decrease. In 2017, 10.4 per cent of overpaid fares was sought by customers while the overall value of unclaimed change was about €600,000.“If a customer overpays for their journey with cash after 9 September, the extra change will go towards continuing to improve our services and to local communities across the Greater Dublin Area through the Community Spirit Awards,” it said in a statement. Fianna Fail’s transport spokesman Robert Troy said the move should be delayed until the cashless service has been fully implemented.

Addressing a packed meeting of about 600 people in Cavan on Tuesday night, Mr Quinn (71) criticised aspects of the management of his former cement and plastic business and said it needed “major capital investment”. He said he was “still fit” and “still keen” to run the business again. A group of Irish investors backed by three US hedge funds bought Quinn group operations in Cavan and Fermanagh in 2014, saying they believed they had Mr Quinn’s “moral backing” for the deal.The new owners then appointed Liam McCaffrey, former Quinn group deputy, along with Dara O’Reilly and Kevin Lunney to run the new entity, Quinn Industrial Holdings Ltd.In a subsequent letter to the main Irish shareholders of the firm, Mr Quinn claimed he had been treated in “a deplorable manner”.Becoming emotional at times during Tuesday’s meeting, Mr Quinn told the community gathering he had run his company for 35 years in an honourable way and he recalled that he had been accused of “trying to commit fraud” against it. He also said he would post 140 pages of documents online in the coming days. Asked from the floor about his plans and whether he would try to get back into the company, Mr Quinn said: “I’ve been trying all along. I have said at all times I wanted to buy the company. I wanted to buy all of it. I could have got the finance to pay the equity share because you can’t go into a company without what they call a bit of skin in the game.“So if the business was costing €500 million to €600 million at the time, which it would, you would need a percentage of that and that is still the case, you would need a percentage of what is left.” He added: “Do I feel that if I was back in Derrylin (Co Fermanagh) in the morning that I could make a success of it? Yes. I don’t think there’s anybody would make a greater success of it and I think I would pay more money back to the bondholders than any man on this earth but it wouldn’t be easy . . . it needs major capital investment.“So it is a mess. Could I sort it out? Well let’s put it this way, I don’t think there’s anybody even at 70 years of age or 70-plus, I don’t think there would be anybody that would be able to sort it out better.” “I’m still fit, I’m still keen, I’m still determined and I know that with the support of the customers, the staff, the neighbours, the friends, the landowners, and I think it has all the support to make it as good as it could be made based on the position it’s in.” Mr Quinn, the son of a farmer who later went on to become a billionaire and Ireland’s richest man, was jailed for nine weeks for contempt of court in 2012.He and his son Sean jr, were jailed for their part in continuing to put assets beyond the reach of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation after the former Anglo Irish Bank seized the Quinn Group in 2011. Last month, the action by Seán Quinn’s wife Patricia and members of her family denying liability for some €2.34 billion in loans advanced by Anglo to Quinn companies was provisionally set for January next year. A spokesman for Quinn Industrial Holdings Ltd said managmement of the company did not attend Tuesday’s public meeting. “Management from the company did not attend the meeting, which unfortunately appeared to be set on airing inaccurate representations of the company’s prospects. Quinn Industrial Holdings DAC reported a 59 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last year, and this year has seen a continuation of the trend of increased turnover, profits, investment and employment. Due to the hard work of the company’s 830 staff the company’s long-term future is bright,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3604623.1534971133!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"super hero fionn gets thousands of birthday cards and medal from garda%C3%AD","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFionn Doyle (7) pictured in a Garda car in Kildorrery, north Cork. His mother Eimear put out an appeal for people to send him a card for his birthday - and thousands of people from all over the world responded. Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvisionA little boy who is battling leukaemia received thousands of birthday cards from all over the world on Wednesday morning after his mother posted about his birthday on Facebook. A convoy of Garda cars also called to Fionn Doyle’s home in Kildorrery, North Cork along with a fire engine to help celebrate his seventh birthday.Fionn was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of 18 months and after three and a half years of gruelling treatment went into remission in July 2016, only to suffer a relapse in December 2016.A bone marrow transplant last December failed to stem the cancer and Eimear Doyle and her husband, Jack and Fionn’s sister, Saoirse( 8) and stepsister, Amy (13) were told in May to brace themselves for the worst when he ended up on a ventilator in Temple Street Children’s Hospital. But Fionn rallied and came back home to Kildorrery. On Wednesday, his bravery was recognised when gardaí from Fermoy presented him with his own garda uniform and medal for being a Super Hero while thousands of well wishers sent him birthday cards from all over the world.“Today was a day we weren’t sure that we would ever see - when Fionn came home from hospital in May after spending days on a ventilator, we were told days to weeks at most, nothing more, but today was magical - memories made that will last forever,” Ms Doyle said.She explained she had posted a message on Facebook, asking people to send Fionn a birthday card, but she never expected the response that they got. The local post-man delivered up to 10,000 cards, including from America, Australia and South Africa. “He knew he was getting birthday cards but they’ve been arriving at a rate of 2,000 a day for the last few days- we’ve only opened 1,500 so far and they are from all over Cork and Ireland and all over the world so we told him it was because the world heard that he was a Super Hero.“He knew the post was coming but to see his face light up when he saw the Garda cars from Fermoy and the Mitchelstown Fire Engine driving up to the house this morning, it was brilliant.” “Cancer has always been in his life since he was 18 months so he has no concept of life without it, but today just gave him a massive lift- it was just magical and we are so grateful to everyone who made it such a special day for him and for us and gave us memories we will cherish forever.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3604423.1534956317!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk to issue first batch of no deal advice on thursday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK Brexit minister Dominic Raab: “I remain confident a good deal is within our sights.” Photograph: François LenoirFile PhotoReutersThe British government will on Thursday publish the first batch of technical notices advising citizens and businesses on how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. About 20 notices out of a total of more than 80, covering everything from veterinary medicine to banking and the Common Travel Area, are expected to be published, although the government declined to specify which areas would be covered in the first batch.In a speech to coincide with the publication, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is expected to stress that Britain believes that the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal is unlikely.“I remain confident a good deal is within our sights, and that remains our top, and over-riding, priority ... But, we must be ready to consider the alternative. We have a duty, as a responsible government, to plan for every eventuality,” he is expected to say.“These technical notices – and the ones that will follow – are a sensible, measured and proportionate approach to minimising the impact of no deal on British firms, citizens, charities and public bodies.”Conservative Brexiteers who have long complained about the government’s failure to prepare adequately for a no-deal Brexit now fear that publishing information about its impact could weaken their argument that no deal with Brussels is better than a bad deal.Mr Raab will stress that the notices are designed to provide information and guidance to make a no-deal Brexit as smooth as possible. But some of the plans would involve Britain continuing to follow EU rules after Brexit.“In some cases, it means taking unilateral action to maintain as much continuity as possible in the short term, in the event of no deal – irrespective of whether the EU reciprocates. Of course, while we may take that approach in the short term, we will be outside the EU, and free to erge when we are ready, on our terms, in the UK national interest and when it’s right for the British people,” Mr Raab is expected to say.“And many of the no-deal challenges will affect the EU in similar ways.\u0026nbspFor our part, if the negotiations fail, we will continue to behave as responsible European neighbours, partners and allies. That should extend to necessary engagement with our EU partners when it comes to no-deal planning.”Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said that if the publication of the documents was an attempt to dress up the severe consequences of a no-deal Brexit as somehow acceptable, the exercise would be pointless.“A no-deal Brexit would be a complete failure by the government to negotiate for Britain. These documents should not distract us from that.\u0026nbspNo deal would be catastrophic for people’s jobs, the economy and for the Border in Northern Ireland. It is irresponsible for anyone to casualise no deal,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

She also sang a line of the song from memory, Funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, How love can make you cry.The Rolling Stones, who wrapped up a tour of Britain and Europe in July, have said they are working on a new studio albumThat matches with Lee\u0027s recording, except Jagger and Simon appear to sing change instead of cry. Jagger does most of the singing, with Simon adding some harmonies.When the song ends, a female voice believed to be Simon\u0027s gasps: Good song.Simon and Jagger worked together in 1972 when the Rolling Stones frontman supposedly sang backup vocals on Simon\u0027s hit You\u0027re So Vain. For many years, it was thought that Jagger was the subject of that song, but Simon has denied that.Lee, an entrepreneur from London, declined to say where the tape of the song came from. But he said Wednesday that he sent a digital copy of the song to Rolling Stone magazine because they promised to give it to Simon.I\u0027m not doing it for the money, Lee said. I\u0027m a collector. My motive for sending it to Rolling Stone was to pass it to Carly.Representatives from the Rolling Stones did not immediately respond to a request for comment.While the song will be new to most listeners, it is not completely unknown to hardcore Stones fans. But it\u0027s not exactly easy to find, either.A snippet of the song, with its passage of Jagger repeatedly singing, It\u0027s funny, funny, funny, is briefly heard in a scene in the publicly unreleased documentary about the 1972 Rolling Stones tour of America. The name of the film is obscene in itself, stemming from the obscene name of an obscene song the band recorded a few years earlier to fulfill a recording contract they didn\u0027t want to actually fulfill.In cleaner terms, and as a hint to the name of the tour movie, that song is often referred to as Schoolboy Blues.The new finding comes two years after another previously unheard Rolling Stones song was uncovered. That song, No One Loves You More Than Me, is believed to have been recorded in 1964 and was found in 2016. The tape of that song was reportedly sold at auction.The Rolling Stones, who wrapped up a tour of Britain and Europe in July, have said they are working on a new studio album.

Students in England will receive the new numerical grades in a further 20 subjects on Thursday.Those in Wales and Northern Ireland will continue to receive their grades in the traditional A* to G format.\u0026nbspFollow all the reaction and read our live blog belowExams regulator Ofqual announced earlier this week that it had taken\u0026nbspextraordinary action to stop pupils from ending up with U grades in\u0026nbspa higher tier GCSE\u0026nbspscience\u0026nbsppaper\u0026nbsptomorrow.The regulator took\u0026nbspthe highly unusual step of intervening\u0026nbspover the fail grades\u0026nbspfor the tougher\u0026nbspGCSE science paper after it found that more students than expected were getting an unclassified result for combined science.\u0026nbspWhen judging results against expectations, exam boards believed that in some cases students should have been entered for the easier foundation tier paper.Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, has predicted that a higher percentage of students will gain the two new top grades - 8s and 9s - than the proportion of A*s awarded under the old system ahead of GCSE results day.Professor Smithers has also predicted that boys will close the\u0026nbspgap with girls at the top grades – as less coursework and more exams is supposed to favour boys.There have been suggestions\u0026nbspthat the grade boundaries could be lower this year for the new tougher\u0026nbspGCSEs compared with the old system.Last year, when grades were awarded for the first time for the new maths GCSE, students sitting the higher tier maths paper only\u0026nbspneeded to score\u0026nbsp18 per cent\u0026nbspof the marks\u0026nbspto secure a grade 4 - which is a\u0026nbsppass under the new scale.For many students, preparation for the GCSE exams\u0026nbspbegin\u0026nbspat the end of Year 9 or start of Year 10.\u0026nbspBut this week it emerged that children as young as 11 have been sitting GCSE-style tests in school.\u0026nbspEducation magazine\u0026nbspTES\u0026nbspfound that at least three of the largest school exam boards are marketing\u0026nbsptests modelled on GCSE exams that can be used in the first three years of secondary school.AQA, the biggest exam board, produces an English language paper for Year 7 pupils that is designed to be taken over one hour and 45 minutes. It comes with mark schemes covering different assessment objectives.Tens of thousands of\u0026nbspstudents in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are anxiously waiting to open their GCSE exam results tomorrow.

We tended to dissect ghastly business practices.It is not the first time Facebook has made a weird call, he revealed, saying: When my roommate got murdered in 2007, they deleted his profile before the funeral because their policy was \u0027no profiles for dead people\u0027. They\u0027ve changed policy since but it made coordinating confusing.His original tweet, which was shared more than 2,000 times, prompted others to share their own stories of tech companies acting in poor taste.The social network also faced criticism in 2014 when its Year in Review feature suggested a picture\u0026nbspof someone\u0027s\u0026nbsphouse burning down, while another user said it showed a photograph of his recently-deceased daughter.Facebook apologised at the time, saying: Clearly in this case we brought him grief rather than joy. It\u0027s valuable feedback. We can do better.Facebook exec tells media: Work with us or your business will dieThe feature was subsequently tweaked so it stated, see you next year, instead of It\u0027s been a great year! Thanks for being a part of it.More recently, Facebook was forced to apologise for adorning balloons and confetti on posts by survivors of a deadly earthquake in Indonesia.In that instance, the fault also lay with Facebook\u0027s algorithm, which was programmed to trigger animations when the word \u0027salemat\u0027 was written in a post. Unfortunately, \u0027salemat\u0027 means both \u0027congratulations\u0027 and \u0027unhurt\u0027 in Indonesian.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/22/08/danny-boyle.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/22/08/danny-boyle.jpg","title":"idris elba james bond danny boyle daniel craig replacement who","story":"Created with Sketch.The Luther star has long been considered a frontrunner to become the new 007Click to followThe Independent CultureIdris Elba confirms he won’t be the next James Bond hours after Danny Boyle steps down as directorIdris Elba has denied rumours he will be replacing Daniel Craig as James Bond.The actor has long been considered a frontrunner to replace the 007 star when he steps down from the franchise, however, he has put an end to the rumours.Elba was asked by Good Morning Britain reporter Divya Kohli at the premiere of his directorial debut Yardie whether she was looking at the next 007 to which he simply replied: “No”.The actor, whose credits include hit TV shows The Wire and Luther, recently fuelled speculation following reports that producer Barbara\u0026nbspBroccoli said the door is open for a black Bond in a future film.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe IndependentSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/22/16/istock-458097145.jpg","title":"nasa intern job loss twitter homer hickam space council","story":"Created with Sketch.The Nasa hopeful insulted Homer Hickman, not realizing he was on the National Space Council that overseas the space agencyThe Nasa hopeful had no idea who she was swearing atClick to followThe Independent TechA hopeful Nasa intern has lost the position before she even started after swearing at a member of Nasa\u0027s space council on Twitter.The\u0026nbspsince-deleted tweet caused thousands to react on the social media platform, eventually bringing the thread to the attention of the US space agency.Everyone shut the f*** up I got accepted for a Nasa\u0026nbspinternship, the Twitter user, who goes by the name Naomi H, wrote on Tuesday.When another user replied, Language, she responded: Suck my d*** and balls I\u0027m working at Nasa.Nasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsNasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsUnfortunately for her, the person who responded was Homer Hickam, a former Nasa\u0026nbspengineer and author who now serves on the organisation that oversees the space agency.His response to her profanity-filled tweet simply stated: And I am on the National Space Council that oversees Nasa.\u0026nbspNasa astronaut plays the first ever game of tennis in spaceNaomi H has since made her tweets protected and changed her bio to: Taking a break from Twitter for a while.Mr Hickam\u0026nbspalso deleted his tweets when the thread began to attract attention, as he claims to have not wanted to get her in trouble with Nasa.He explained his motivations in a blog post, saying that he had no role in her losing the offer of an internship at the space agency.I do not hire and fire at the agency or have any say on employment whatsoever, Mr Hickam\u0026nbspwrote.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s.

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together before1724 Dog-sized horned dinosaur fossil found shows east-west evolutionary ide in North AmericaA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1924 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”.

This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.US ecologist Professor Bruce Lieberman, who co-led the University of Kansas team, said: “Maybe in the long term the best evolutionary strategy for animals is to be lassitudinous and sluggish.“The lower the metabolic rate, the more likely the species you belong to will survive. Instead of ‘survival of the fittest’, maybe a better metaphor for the history of life is ‘survival of the laziest’ or at least ‘survival of the sluggish’.”The findings, reported in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, could have important implications for forecasting the fate of species affected by climate change, said the scientists.Dr Luke Strotz, also from the University of Kansas, said: “In a sense, we’re looking at a potential predictor of extinction probability.“At the species level, metabolic rate isn’t the be all, end all of extinction – there are a lot of factors at play. But these results say that the metabolic rate of an organism is a component of extinction likelihood.“With a higher metabolic rate, a species is more likely to go extinct. So, it’s another tool in the toolbox. This will increase our understanding of the mechanisms that drive extinction and help us to better determine the likelihood of a species going extinct.”Energy consumption had a bigger impact on species that were narrowly distributed, the researchers found.Species with a narrowly confined range were far more likely to go extinct if they had a high metabolic rate.Molluscs were used for the study because of the huge amount of available data on living and extinct bivalve and gastropod species.The team now plans followup work to see if “survival of the laziest” natural selection applies to other kinds of animals.Dr Strotz added: “There is a question as to whether this is just a mollusc phenomenon.“There’s some justification, given the size of this data set, and the long amount of time it covers, that it’s generalisable. But you need to look – can it apply to vertebrates? Can it apply on land?”The oldest animal ever known was a 507-year-old clam from the Icelandic seabed called Ming.\u0026nbspThe incredibly low metabolic rates of Ming and its fellow ocean quahog clams is thought to be responsible for their long lifes.Unfortunately, Ming’s long life was brought to an abrupt end in 2006 when scientists assessing its age killed it by opening its shell.Additional reporting by PAEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/22/14/banner-banned-c-207285.jpg","title":"confederate flag cheltenham country western music","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027I\u0026nbspdidn’t realise it was racist or anything like that,\u0027 says 71-year-old John BryantClick to followThe IndependentThe American Confederate flag which was seen flying in CheltenhamA country and western music fan was forced to take down a Confederate flag flying over his house following\u0026nbspallegations of racism.John Bryant flew the controversial flag over his semi-detached home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.The 71-year-old said\u0026nbsphe put it up only because he enjoyed\u0026nbspcountry and western music, and that he knew nothing about its controversial nature.He has since taken down the flag and says he will not display it again.Mr Bryant said: “To be honest, I didn’t realise it was racist or anything like that.

The only letting agent not to have any bans in place\u0026nbspwas Hunters.Almost half (48 per cent) of all the branches contacted by the charity\u0026nbspsaid they had no suitable homes or landlords willing to let to someone on housing benefit.Around 1.6 million adults rely on housing benefit to help with private rents, the majority of whom are women – especially single mothers with childcare responsibilities.\u0026nbspPeople who receive disability benefits are also three times more likely to need a housing benefit top-up, according to Shelter.One woman who has been affected is\u0026nbspsingle mother Lauren, who\u0026nbsphas lived in the same privately rented home in Lewes for 14-years\u0026nbspand says she has always paid her rent on time. Despite holding down three jobs, due to recent increases in her rent, she is searching for a cheaper home.There is huge discrimination, everyone is tarred with the same brush, and it’s unfair.”Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: “This ugly undercurrent of discrimination is wreaking havoc on hundreds of thousands of people’s lives. ‘No DSS’ is an outdated and outrageous example of blatant prejudice.“Private renting is now so expensive that many people simply can’t get by without some housing benefit, even if they’re working.“Rejecting all housing benefit tenants is morally bankrupt, and because these practices overwhelmingly impact women and disabled people, they could be unlawful.” \u0026nbspDavid Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, which represents social landlords of around six\u0026nbspmillion people, said the homeless shelters and charities housing vulnerable people that they represent were finding it increasingly difficult to help their residents move in to their own home.\u0026nbsp“Often, nowhere in the private rented sector will take someone on benefits and the chronic shortage of social housing means often none of this is available,” he added.Responding to the findings, David Cox, chief executive of letting agents\u0027 body Arla Propertymark, said: “Rents are paid in advance, whereas housing benefit is paid in arrears, and therefore with such a shortage of rental accommodation, landlords and agents will naturally choose a tenant who can pay the rent when it is due, rather than a tenant who is always a month in arrears.“We have called on government time and time again to resolve this problem. But our calls have fallen on deaf ears. This situation does not exist because of landlords or letting agents, it is a systemic problem caused by Government and the banks.”A spokesman for Haart\u0026nbspapologised, saying:\u0026nbspIt is not our policy to refuse housing benefit tenants – anyone who passes referencing checks is able to rent properties listed with our branches.We do regularly arrange tenancies for those claiming housing benefits and currently have 112 tenancies where this is the case.UK news in picturesAnti Brexit activists protest as they deliver a pile of medical supplies in cardboard boxes to the Department of Health and Social Care in London.

Nearly 10 per cent said they did not know and\u0026nbsp7 per cent said they would not vote.When pollsters removed “don’t knows”, they found a 50-50 split between remain and leave voters.Mr Kellner said: “On the night of the Brexit referendum two years ago, the early results from the northeast showed the strength of leave support, especially in Labour’s northern heartlands. YouGov’s new survey shows that a public vote today would produce a very different result.“Instead of the crushing 16-point victory for the leave campaign two years ago, the two sides are running neck and neck, with both on 50 per cent.“The swing in the northeast is higher than the national average and there is a clear reason for this. The region is more strongly Labour than any other:\u0026nbspthe party has 26 of the northeast’s 29 MPs.

But the European Union is not going to be impressed by that kind of blame game, everyone should understand that.“On the first day of the first press conference I came before you as a negotiator,\u0026nbspI said Brexit will have numerous consequences –\u0026nbsphuman, social consequences, economic, financial, technical, legal –\u0026nbspand I said that many people had underestimated those consequences.”Mr Barnier’s warning comes as the EU and UK both pledge to intensify negotiations, with both sides wanting to reach a deal by October.\u0026nbspMr Raab, who visited Brussels on Tuesday, said he wanted to “step up the intensity of talks” and said there were still issues to resolve on Northern Ireland and the future relationship. He added that those issues must be dealt with at a “political” level.He also said the UK was committed to leaving the EU in March next year even if it was with\u0026nbspno deal.Brexit will have numerous consequences: human, social consequences, economic, financial, technical, legal, and I said that many people had underestimated those consequences“Some of these hair-raising scare stories are very far from the truth,” he said, adding that he would set out more details about preparations for no deal on Thursday.Responding to whether the UK would reconsider its decision to quit the block in the event no agreement is reached, he said: “Certainly on the UK side, no. We’ll be leaving in March of next year.”There has been barely any movement in talks over the summer as both sides say each others’ plans for the Northern Ireland border and the future trade relationship are unacceptable.Continuing political uncertainty in the UK is also a major roadblock to a proper deal, with Theresa May’s Chequers plan opposed by many within her own party. The EU has said dismissed the plan as unworkable in several significant ways.Both sides have little room for manoeuvre\u0026nbspto change their positions, however: Ms May appears to believe she has already given more concessions to the EU than her party will allow her, while the\u0026nbspEuropean Commission negotiators have their mandate set by the EU27\u0026nbspnations, who say they are not prepared to change the nature of their union\u0026nbspto accommodate\u0026nbspBritain’s departure.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

A month later, Russia’s Supreme Court upheld the decision and ordered the group’s official representation to disband. \u0026nbsp“It doesn’t matter where in Russia they try to worship – in their meeting houses, which the state is beginning to confiscate, or in private homes,” said\u0026nbspGeraldine Fagan, author of Believing in Russia – Religious Policy after Communism. “It\u0026nbsprepresents the worst roll back of religious freedom since the fall of Communism.” \u0026nbspIt is unclear exactly why the Kremlin chose to use its broad extremist laws against the movement. Initially\u0026nbspthe Russian Justice Ministry’s moves against the group appeared to be\u0026nbspa response to an aggressive leafleting campaign.\u0026nbspSome have suggested the group’s opposition to overt patriotism and violence played a role. The influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, which views Jehovah’s Witnesses as a dangerous sect, is also apparent.\u0026nbspIn the 17 months since the ban was enacted, dozens of Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses have been arrested. Most of an\u0026nbspestimated 175,000 members of the denomination\u0026nbspin Russia no longer advertise their faith. Many, it seems, are looking for new lives elsewhere.\u0026nbspAccording to the Finnish Immigration Service, the number of applications from Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses grew from five in 2016 to more than\u0026nbsp100 in 2017 and 2018. The number of asylum applications also grew, from 193 in 2016 to 309 in the year to date. The\u0026nbsplatter figure\u0026nbspincludes all kinds of groups – from opposition activists to refugees from the northern Caucasus.Finnish immigration officials told The Independent the vast majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses applications have yet to be processed. There had been only a “handful” of accepted applications and a “handful” of negative decisions, officials\u0026nbspsaid with nearly all of those rejected since appealing.\u0026nbsp“Each of the cases is dealt with on an inidual basis,” The Independent was told. “Persecution of these groups has not been systematic across Russia, and the approach of the ministry has taken this into account.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesHigh waves hit Jeju Island, South Korea, as powerful Typhoon Soulik gradually approaches the Korean PeninsulaA Palestinian man throws his child in the air following morning prayers marking the first day of Eid al-Adha celebrations on the compound known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem\u0027s Old City.

around whether the UK and EU will agree a Brexit deal before the proposed October deadline.The EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had questioned whether an exit deal would be struck in

single market.But this growth could halve to 1.1 percent if the UK exits the bloc without a trade deal.The figures, compiled by Thomson Reuters, showed that opting for a no deal over a soft Brexit would wipe almost \u0026pound3bn from the turnover of the sector.The Law Society also predicted that by 2025 there could be up to 5,000 few people employed in the legal sector if the UK agrees a

positions, says former Europe ministerThe joint hardline positions on the Irish border, held by the EU and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, have encouraged the lack of a viable solution to the issue, a former Irish minister claimed.Lucinda Crieghton, who was Irish Minister for European Affairs between March 2011 and July 2013, argued that a series of Brexit redlines held by the EU, UK and DUP has caused a stalemate in the debate to find an Irish border solution.She said: \u0026ldquoThere is a lot of pessimism around because you have basically mutually exclusive hardline positions.\u0026ldquoYou obviously have the determination by the Irish government and the EU by extension, to maintain a seamless and borderless existence between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\u0026ldquoWhich of course would mean essentially the territory of Northern Ireland, if not the rest of the UK, remaining in the single market and effectively operating within the customs union.\u0026ldquoObviously the commitment of those who campaigned for Brexit and those who are still advocating a very clean break from the EU who will not countenance the UK as a whole staying in the single market or effectively within the customs union.\u0026ldquoThen in the middleMinister you have the position of the DUP in Northern Ireland who will not allow the territory of Northern Ireland to be in anyway treated differently or separately to the rest of the UK.Brexit news: Liam Fox suggested the UK could scrap the current migration target policy after Brexit (Image: )9am update: Vince Cable attacks \u0027empty, bombastic\u0027 Liam Fox trade declarationVince Cable has attacked International Trade Secretary Liam Fox\u0027s claims that Britain will become an exporting superpower.The Liberal Democrat leader argued that Brexit will create barriers to trade and that the Government have not offered business any \u0026ldquoresource to aid exports.He said: \u0026ldquoI would expect the Trade Secretary to be promoting trade and in the favour of exports, that is what he does for a living.\u0026ldquoThe problem is the rhetoric and the verbiage is not backed up by anything concrete, there is no resource available to help exporters.\u0026ldquoIn addition, the whole process of Brexit, whether you are in favour or not, involves creating barriers to British exports because non-tariff barriers do not exist within the single market prism will disappear and there will be barriers in the future.\u0026ldquoSo it is a rather empty, slightly bombastic declaration.\u0026ldquoThe big picture is we are in danger of losing access to existing markets, not just the single market of the EU but a whole lot of preferential arrangements around the world.\u0026ldquoIf you are a British exporter at the moment you are faced with massive uncertainty which is hardly good for the objectives that Liam Fox wants to achieve.8.55am update: Liam Fox suggests \u0027tens of thousands\u0027 migration target could be scrappedInternational Trade Secretary Liam Fox has suggested the UK could scrap the current migration policy after Brexit following the Government announcing plans to give EU citizens the right to stay in the event of a no deal.Asked whether he agreed with the UK\u0027s immigration target of 100,000, he told LBC: I think that one of the things that was clear from the referendum was that the public do not want unlimited movement into the United Kingdom.The public can differentiate between people who come here with a job and will be contributing to the economy and those who under free movement were able to come to the United Kingdom and use our public services without ever having contributed to them.Well that\u0027s the government target and we\u0027ll be reviewing what we do post-Brexit.The intervention from the Tory frontbencher came hours after Theresa May announced she would take the moral high ground during talks with Brussels and offer the three million EU citizens the right to stay in Britain even after a no deal.8.40am update: Emergency talks in Northern Ireland as fears heighten over no-dealBusiness Secretary Greg Clark has held urgent

conceded that talks over a withdrawal deal are unlikely to be may not be completed by the European Council summit in October as previously hoped, leading to fears that Brexit will be delayed.The EU\u0027s chief negotiator and Brecit Secretary Dominic Raab are yet to fully agree on the Irish backstop, outstanding withdrawal agreement issues and a political declaration on the future relationship.Standing next to Mr Raab at a press conference in Brussels on Tuesday following further talks, Mr Barnier said: If you count backwards from that date, March 30 2019, the day on which the UK will no longer be a member of the European Union \u0026ndash while remaining for 21 months, if we reach an agreement, in the single market, customs union and European policies \u0026ndash the countdown backwards from there has to take account of the time which is necessary for ratification.\u0026ldquoThat is a given, it will take a certain amount of time to ratify the agreement \u0026ndash on the UK side and the European side.That takes us for a final agreement on the withdrawal agreement and political declaration well before the end of the year \u0026ndash I\u0027m not going to say

SHOCK DISCOVERY: 16,000 year-old SKULL could show how we developed                Was prehistoric global warming caused by pre-human species?Co-author Professor Bence Viola, an anthropologist at Toronto University, said: The fragment is part of a long bone and we can estimate this inidual was at least 13 years old.The fossil was found by Russian archaeologists during an excavation of the famous cave in 2012.It was taken to Leipzig for genetic analyses after it was identified as the bone of an early human - or hominid - based on its protein composition.The Altai Mountains are a range where Russia, China, Mongolia and Kazakhstan come together.The ancient girl described in Nature is only represented by a single small fragment of bone  (Image: SWNS)Co-author Dr Fabrizio Mafessoni, also based at MPI-EVA, said: An interesting aspect of this genome is it allows us to learn things about two populations - the Neanderthals from the mother\u0027s side and the Denisovans from the father\u0027s sideThe researchers determined the mother was genetically closer to Neanderthals who lived in western Europe than to those that lived earlier in Russia.This shows Neandertals migrated between western and eastern Europe - and Asia - tens of thousands of years before their disappearance.Analyses of the genome also revealed the Denisovan father had at least one Neanderthal ancestor further back in his family tree.A view of the valley from above the cave (Image: SWNS)Dr Benjamin Vernot, of the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology, said: So from this single genome we are able to detect multiple instances of interactions between Neanderthals and Denisovans.Scientists believe there are still unknown human lineages yet to be discovered - and paleontologists will find more of our family tree.This situation in which there were multiple hominid populations on Earth at the same time would be similar to JRR Tolkien\u0027s fantasy world he named Middle-earth.Lead author Professor Svante Paabo, director of the department of evolutionary genetics at the MPI-EVA, said: It\u0027s striking we find this NeanderthalDenisovan child among the handful of ancient iniduals whose genomes have been sequenced.It shows our ancient ancestors interbred much more frequently than thought (Image: SWNS)Neanderthals and Denisovans may not have had many opportunities to meet. But when they did they must have mated frequently - much more so than we previously thought.DNA evidence has shown Neanderthals lived among modern humans for thousands of years and interbred with them before they became extinct.And they were not the only other human-like intelligent species in prehistoric times.In 2003 scientists identified Floriensis (check) - known as the hobbit people - in Indonesia - five years before the Denisovans were discovered.It means tens of thousands of years ago there were at least four different forms of humans on the planet.

Even those of us who will never hit the big time have an Instagram audience waiting to “like” our every selfie.So this is just the logical next step towards making cosmetic surgery available to the masses, rather than the few.Some have argued that Superdrug Botox is actually a good thing, because it bridges the gap between the elite Harley Street options — where you pay several hundred pounds for an appointment with an “aesthetic doctor” — and the more backstreet treatments carried out by hairdressers with just a few hours of training.I disagree. Being able to buy a syringe or two of Botox when you are out shopping for your hairspray legitimises — and normalises — the act of injecting poison in your skin in the name of beauty.Being able to buy Botox over the counter, so to speak, makes it seem like no big deal — just another tick in the “maintenance” box, and as reasonable as tinting your lashes or getting your ears pierced.And that is the problem. All decisions we make about our appearance boil down to personal choice. And if it makes someone feel better to tinker cosmetically or surgically with their natural looks, that’s their choice. No one should judge them for it.But there is a wider problem.Increasingly, women think that whatever they look like naturally isn’t good enough. More and more, the “solution” is invasive cosmetic enhancement.A mainstream shop making Botox available for less than 100 quid is surely only going to add to the pressure some women feel to change their appearance using more than just make-up.Superdrug presents itself as responsible because it will refuse to treat under-25s, when other clinics will.That is shocking — not so much that some clinics WILL treat under-25s but that anyone so young could think they need Botox.You can’t blame Superdrug for this epidemic. It is simple supply and demand.The question is: Why the growing desire among women to look frozen?It’s not like you can get away with saying you’ve not had it when you have, because it’s so obvious.I’ve got a friend whose husband jokes that she needs to hold up little signs saying “happy” or “angry” when she feels an emotion, since her face is so paralysed by botulism.While I’m a big believer in your body, your choice, I’m also a believer in scratching the right itch.The truth is if you feel good about yourself, you look good. If you feel bad and lack confidence, nothing, no amount of Botox or fillers, will ever change that.Just look at Meg from Love Island, above, who, even after an estimated £40,000 worth of plastic surgery, is still massively insecure.Because it’s not what’s on the outside that counts, it’s what’s on the inside.The problem is our society tends to give far too much weight to the outside. That is especially the case for women, but increasingly for men, too.I realise all of this is easy to say, harder to act on. I’m as susceptible as the next person to comparing myself with ­others more beautiful — and possibly more airbrushed — and finding myself lacking.I’m just glad that, when that happens, I know the thing that will make me feel better is far more likely to be self-acceptance than Botox.After all, if you tighten a prune you don’t get a grape — you just get a tight prune!So the really big question is, how to achieve self-acceptance when we are surrounded by all these images of perfection?Well, we are all on our own journey with that one but I’ve got some suggestions which might help.The first is to focus on what you have, rather than what you don’t. And the second is to never, ever compare yourself to anyone else.Forget Botox, you can have that advice for free.You’re welcome.We all enjoyed cheering on the Three Lions players that would quickly become our heroes during the World Cup in Russia this summer.Sadly, those heady days are over and we were reminded of the seamier side of sport this week with the arrest of England rugby union ace Danny Cipriani.His embarrassing brawl outside a Jersey nightclub came hot on the heels of England cricket’s Ben Stokes’ trial over his clash with two men during a night out.Stokes was cleared, but what links these sorry sagas is our drinking culture, which dictates that consuming excessive amounts of alcohol is a normal way of letting off steam.Sportsmen are supposed to be role models, as they influence young people and need to keep themselves in good physical shape.But as long as we think it is OK to binge and push our bodies to the limits rather than sip a few drinks, then violence, injuries and stupid mistakes will continue to be a regular feature of our nights out.And if you are an England sports star, then public shame is just one of the tragic consequences – along with the end of your career – that you might have to face.Why should anyone be surprised at the news that sexual harassment in the police force is rife?Let’s face it, it happens everywhere. So why should the police be any exception?I thought they might hold themselves to higher standards. But no.A new survey reveals that dirty jokes, inappropriate touching, leering and being pressured to have sex are daily issues for many police staff.In a survey of almost 1,800 police staff in England, Wales and Scotland, half had heard sexualised jokes and one in five had received a sexually explicit email or text from a colleague.Shockingly, one in five had also been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable.Our head of police at West Ham is a woman.She is smart, tough, brave and would never put up with this type of behaviour.Part of the problem is that many women accept these actions as “normal” and don’t even know how to object. We must learn to stop putting up with it.But it is much more important that men learn what is OK and what is not.End of.Jacinda Ardern – the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who has continued to work since becoming a mother in June – was criticised this week for “using her baby as a prop” after she was seen breastfeeding her daughter at a public meeting.I guess whoever coined that phrase has never had the experience of looking after a baby who needs to be fed – right NOW.Nor will they have dealt with the very loud consequences of that failing to happen.Instead, what about congratulating Jacinda on doing such a great job of being a working mum?We said farewell to two legends last week, let’s remember them with this wonderful meme....So interesting that the day after A-level results arrived, more than 26,000 university places were still available.An Ipsos Mori poll found that while most students still think university is “important”, that is down from 86 per cent five years ago to 75 per cent now.Since a degree is expensive – and no guarantee of a job – you can see why people are questioning the validity of one.However, there is no viable alternative.There are just 10,000 degree-level apprenticeships available, compared with 300,000 university places, according to Sir Peter Lampl, of the Sutton Trust.We need to think how we prepare young people for work and we need more technical qualifications at degree level that offer the chance of a bright future.GOT a story?

Our poll shows those that have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave. Project Fear has never worked, and it is not going to suddenly start working now. The public are wise to it.Our poll makes it clear that fudging Brexit would unleash serious anger among the electorate. The Government should take notice.Almost half of voters already reckon that the political classes in Britain are making heavy weather of Brexit, in the vain and misguided belief that they can get the public to change their mind.Meanwhile, the drop in support for Theresa May in the polls and Ukip’s rise is a further indication of what the public thought of her Chequers proposals.Millions more will abandon the Tories if Brexit ends up being fudged.Remoaners and Brussels have done their best since the Leave vote to make us think we made a terrible mistake and that the cards are stacked in the EU’s favour.Well, today’s poll is clear. We didn’t and they’re not.DEFENCE Secretary Gavin Williamson was right to stand up to France after they tried to bill us £2million for helping them stamp out a jihadi insurrection in Mali.Mr Williamson reportedly threatened to ground our choppers in retaliation.

It is whether the PM herself will seize the initiative and signal her own plan to jump before she is pushed.The undeclared contest has transformed Britain’s negotiating stance — from Theresa May’s meek, slow-motion surrender to a strident demand for a decent, honourable settlement. The good news is that while MPs have been away on holiday, Brussels has begun to blink.At long last it has dawned on our EU neighbours that they have more to lose from a messy Brexit than we do.Forfeiting the UK’s £40billion ransom payment — plus our annual £12billion contribution — would instantly cripple the EU expansionary budget plans and plunge poorer nations such as Greece into crisis.Car and pharmaceutical giants, not to mention French farmers, who export vast stocks to the UK, would be plunged into crisis. Cooperation on crime, security and defence would be at risk. Governments across Europe are now piling pressure on Brussels to see sense.Tory leadership wannabes have sniffed the way the wind is blowing.The Tories won’t pick another Remainer as party leader. Nor does this Government have a prayer at the next election unless it can see off Nigel Farage and his Ukip insurgents with a deal that satisfies the 52 per cent who voted Leave.This explains a sudden enthusiasm at the top for stating the blindingly obvious: Britain will survive a clean Brexit, while an obstructive Brussels will be diminished.After two years of being bossed around by EU bully Michel Barnier, senior Cabinet ministers are coming out as born-again Eurosceptics. Foreign Secretary and repentant Remainer Jeremy Hunt admits Britain will experience some turbulence, but says the EU will be damaged “for a generation”.His warning is echoed by Brexit supremo Dominic Raab, who has rubbished “Project Fear” stories about food and medicine shortages.While loyally insisting a deal is “still the most likely outcome”, Mr Raab insists Britain will cope with the alternative.Hunt and Raab are now openly jockeying for the top job — along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Treasury chief Liz Truss and a host of others.Significantly, Michael Gove seems out of the race after endorsing Mrs May’s Chequers sellout. So where does this leave Boris Johnson? If tens of thousands of grass- roots Tory supporters have anything to do with it, he would be way out in front. As things stand, they don’t.BoJo is out of office and fighting confected outrage over Muslim face masks. Enemies such as the priestly Dominic Grieve threaten to quit the party if he is elected.Under present rules, Boris needs enough support from fellow MPs to be one of the two candidates submitted to party members for a final verdict. His rivals will do anything to stop him — which is why party activists are demanding rule changes to allow any MP with 20 votes to enter the final ballot.Boris has gone quiet — but not for long. He is reportedly planning a nationwide tour — complete with bright-red battle bus — trashing Mrs May’s Chequers deal and calling for a clean Brexit.There will be plenty of opportunities for car-crash interviews and zipwire-style TV images. But the bookies aren’t the only ones making BoJo the clear favourite as Britain’s next Prime Minister.He names Somalis, Ethiopians, North and Central Africans and Afghans as being responsible for the knife-gang slaughter of young black and Asian men.“Race is part of the picture,” says the equality campaigner. “Failing to point this out impedes the fight against these crimes and imperils yet more children of colour.”He is right, isn’t he?But how long before this decent black man is himself accused of racism for daring to tell this unvarnished truth?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will our current free movement regime be rebadged as a “Labour Mobility Framework”?Such a move, speculated on in the media this week, would be politically toxic and very poorly timed. It would also betray her own instincts, which she rightly gave voice to when she became Prime Minister.Striking a chord with millions of people angry and alienated at their voices being ignored by the political elite on immigration and the downside of globalisation, delivered for her record poll ratings then and a real feeling of hope that at last people in power were listening.Yes, the main driver for the Leave vote was about democracy, independence and national sovereignty but it was also about the fundamental choice that a UK outside the EU would have: Who comes to our country and on what basis – decided by our own Parliament.Voters have noticed that the tightening of the labour market and record employment levels, as revealed by the Office for National Statistics last week, mean that at long last real wages – i.e. pay packets less inflation – are slowly rising and that belatedly big business is beginning to move away from an over reliance on cheap foreign labour, undercutting the pay and conditions of indigenous workers and giving rise to higher welfare dependency.It might seem a radical concept, but such employers might just have to pay workers decent wages, train them better, improve their skills and try hard to retain them. That’s why EU workers are still coming to the UK in huge numbers, despite ridiculous Project Fear stories to the contrary.So yes – Brexit will mean higher pay for British workers! Top businessman Stuart Rose, briefly spokesman for the Remain campaign, accurately predicted such a development before the EU Referendum.Regrettably, the multinationals’ trades union, the CBI didn’t get the message: No surprise that they now want no restrictions on foreign workers post Brexit – in other words an endless pool of cheap labour just like now.Likewise, they’re happy to defend the growing gap between average pay and that of FTSE 100 bosses.Ironically, The Prime Minister could still snatch victory from defeat on this issue, notwithstanding her lamentable record as Home Secretary on reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands.The alternative White Paper which David Davis and his Ministers were working on prior to it being dumped at Chequers, was much more evidence-based and looked to many workable international examples of mobility agreements between first world countries like Australia, the United States, Japan and Canada, as a model for future EU-UK immigration arrangements, to our mutual benefit.The policy would have been informed by the Migration Advisory Committee which reports next month, focused on what was the sensible policy for the whole of the UK and all business sectors rather than a noisy minority and their well-paid advocates.It also sought to end the systemic bias towards low paid and low skilled EU citizens over the well qualified from across the globe.It was pro controlled immigration and not about pulling up the drawbridge and that’s where most British voters are now.Will Theresa May use the opportunity to keep faith with the millions of people in the north and the midlands, in south Wales and south west, who look to her to keep her promises and defend their interests and not just those of the well heeled, the multinationals and those comfortable with the Brussels status quo?Will putative leadership contender Sajid Javid have the courage to resist further attempts at craven supplication on continuing free movement in all but name? Will Conservative MPs who benefited from the highest ever blue collar vote for their party in history, ignore their own electors’ concerns and just accept further concessions?The electoral prospects of her party depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Appropriation.In the eyes of today’s politically correct policers of “wrongthink”, there is no greater crime than cultural appropriation.Cultural appropriation is when people embrace the grub or music or ideas of a culture that isn’t theirs.Like when Kylie Jenner wore her hair in cornrows. Or when Katy Perry donned a Japanese kimono. Or when drunken lads on a university campus put on sombreros as they neck shots of tequila.All of these things have been branded cultural appropriation by today’s potty warriors against “offensiveness”.And to this blacklist of things we must never appropriate, we can now add non-native foods.This is not the first time Jamie Oliver has been criticised for making foreign dishes. Two years ago foodies were up in arms when he put chorizo in paella — which the Spanish tend not to do.Clearly Jamie Oliver is only allowed to cook “white” British food, like roast beef and toad-in-the-hole.Not Cornish pasties or Yorkshire puddings, though.After all, what right does a man born in Essex have to appropriate the food of Northerners and people from the West Country? And presumably Dawn Butler only ever tucks into Jamaican dishes.If it is cultural appropriation for Oliver to make jerk grub, surely it must be cultural appropriation for Ms Butler to rattle up a bit of sushi?This would be the crazy conclusion to the war on cultural appropriation — none of us would ever dip into other cultures and experience their pleasures.What is most depressing about the Butler/Oliver spat is that it confirms how mainstream the miserabilist, divisive PC worldview has gone.It used to be just time-rich posh kids and snowflakes on university campuses who raged against cultural appropriation.Like the officious students at Cambridge who banned an Around The World in 80 Days fancy-dress party for fear students would wear “culturally appropriated” costumes.Or the clipboard bores at the University of East Anglia who banned students from wearing sombreros.Or the easily offended muppets at the University of Ottawa in Canada who banned a yoga class, because for white people to indulge in this ancient Indian discipline is an act of “cultural genocide”.I bet you never knew that when you do a pelvic tilt at your local gym you are being a horrible racist.Now, however, with Butler’s missive against the crimes of Jamie Oliver, this PC claptrap has crept from the fringes into the political centre. Butler is Shadow Secretary for Women and Equalities, and she is very close to Jeremy Corbyn.Is this what we should expect under a Corbyn government? Finger-wagging at anyone who deviates from PC rules?The worst thing about the clampdown on cultural appropriation is how divisive it is. The message is that we must always stick with our own cultures and never borrow from others.Didn’t that used to be known as racism?In recent years, Beyonce has been slammed for wearing a sari. Glastonbury has banned attendees from wearing Native American head-dresses. Selena Gomez was ridiculed for doing a Bollywood- inspired dance on US TV.This new racial divisiveness makes ­culture stiff and dull.Anthony Horowitz, author of the Alex Rider teen spy novels, says he was “warned off” from writing a black character. Apparently a white writer like him ­cannot understand the black experience.Is this really the world we want to live in? Where people never mix and never try to empathise with those who have had different life experiences to theirs?We should stand up for cultural ­appropriation.The global intermingling of food and fashion and art has enriched human life.As the great American novelist Lionel Shriver reminds us: “People with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life.”Yet in their Brave New World, everyone would stick to their own people and their own ways. What a dispiriting, divided world that would be.I would far rather live in a world than has Jamie Oliver jerk chicken in it than in such a racially regimented PC nightmare.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In terms of spending, Scotland has more than paid its way.Spending overall in Scotland was £73.4billion - with the biggest chunk on welfare, at a record £236 billion, while tax revenue was £60billion.But rivals pointed out the so-called “union dividend” - the gap from higher spending plus lower tax revenues - was at £1,882, double the level at the 2014 vote on Scottish Independence.And MP Andrew Bridgen told The Sun: The fact is that without the support of English taxpayers money,  Ms Sturgeon and the SNP would have made Scotland into a copy of Venezuela but without the sunshine.Ms Sturgeon attempted to explain the figures, saying: “Firstly, there are very good reasons why public spending per head in Scotland is higher than it is for the UK.“Not least the rurality of our population. That would be our first point. The second point is, GERS - as it is every year - is looking at a situation over a single year.“If we look at the situation in Scotland within the UK over a longer period of time, this notion that Scotland is somehow subsidised simply doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.”Scottish Tory shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said the figures showed how Scotland could not afford to become independent.He said: “By being part of the UK, Scotland received an extra £1,576 for every man, woman and child last year above the UK average.For a family of four, that’s more than £6,000 in additional public spending.“If Scotland was to be ripped out the UK, this spending would be slashed drastically, meaning schools, hospitals and infrastructure would be hit.”And the Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the deficit figures were concerning.He added: “However these figures also confirm that being part of a strong United Kingdom – the 5th largest economy in the world – is worth nearly £1,900 for every single person in Scotland, which supports vital public services.“Simply put, Scotland contributed eight per cent of UK tax, and received more than nine per cent of UK spending for the benefit of families across the country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Victory came on Tuesday when Environment Minister Michael Gove vowed to ban the sale of puppies and kittens by pet shops and other dealers supplied by commercial puppy farms.  This will mean that anyone wanting a pet will have to go to rescue centres or deal directly with the breeders, so they\u0027ll be able to see the conditions in which the dogs are kept.  “I\u0027m over the moon,” said Paul O\u0027Grady, presenter of the long-running hit show For The Love Of Dogs featuring Battersea Cats \u0026amp Dogs Home. “The campaign has been smashing, it\u0027s great what\u0027s happened, all power to you.”  Paul\u0027s work filming dogs at Battersea means that he routinely sees first hand the grisly evidence of puppy farming. “I\u0027m not hardened to it, each case sickens me,” said Paul, the proud owner of five dogs. “You can always tell a female dog that\u0027s been overbred, the teats are on the floor, the vets can tell when they\u0027ve had too many litters. “I\u0027m constantly saying it on the show, never buy a dog over the internet, go to a rescue centre or a reputable breeder and ask to see the mother, and the puppy should never leave the mother until it\u0027s the right age. “You get internet sellers selling puppies that have not even been weaned. They will die, they will have all sorts of diseases.” Dragon\u0027s Den star Deborah Meaden called the government backing of Lucy\u0027s Law “fantastic news, adding: Thanks to a committed band of supporters”. Another Dragon, Jenny Campbell, tweeted “Awesome result”.  Ricky Gervais posted: “Unethical puppy and kitten farms \u0027to be banned\u0027 in England!”, while Broadcaster Kirsty Gallacher wrote: “What a victory, what a day!”  The message from model Jodie Marsh of Celebrity Big Brother to the army of Lucy\u0027s Law supporters was: “You are wonderful human beings!!!!!!!! What an achievement.”  MPs from across the political spectrum were full of praise.  Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who spoke-up for Lucy\u0027s Law in Parliament, tweeted “fantastic news”. Labour\u0027s Chris Evans posted: “We need to make sure the legislation has teeth now so it’s a real deterrent against this cruel practice.”  Caroline Lucas of the Greens said: “This is great news! Government has finally listened to campaigners who have long been calling for a ban on third party puppy sales.” Numerous charities told of their delight on social media, such as Animal Advocate which wrote: “Can\u0027t thank everyone enough for making my \u0026amp their dream come true.” Rescue charity The Animal Team posted: “Thank you for all that you have done to stop the misery of puppy farms, together we are making a difference”. The K-9 Angels called it a “Truly a great day for animal welfare”, adding “Thanks to all Lucy\u0027s Law supporters”. From the National Animal Welfare Trust there was the message: “Today is a great day for animal welfare and the NAWT is thrilled that the government has announced that they are committed to implementing #LucysLaw to ban third party sales of puppies and kittens.” Will Travers of the Born Free Foundation wrote: Animal champions every one of you - and a brighter day dawns for puppies and kittens. News of the victory went global, thrilling dog lovers campaigning against puppy farming in their own countries. The group Finding Shelter in the USA said: “Congratulations to our dear friends in the UK who never gave up on the dogs. Inspirational.

Campaigning medic Dr Phil Hammond condemned the Corporation\u0027s fear after being dropped from his three-hour Saturday morning slot on BBC Radio Bristol. It came hours after the GP, who investigates and writes about NHS failures, tweeted he will stand against Mr Rees-Mogg for the National Health Action Party in the next general election. In a statement today, Dr Hammond claimed he had told the head of BBC Radio Bristol of his intentions weeks ago and was advised it should not be a problem until the election itself. Saying he was sad and a little puzzled, he added: I strongly suspect whoever made this decision has never listened to any of my broadcasts. Such a sudden decision smells strongly of fear.  There is no political bias on the Saturday Surgery, just three hours of health and happiness with some live music. I shall really miss the fantastic team at BBC Radio Bristol and all the loyal listeners. It\u0027s been a hugely enjoyable 12 years. The National Health Action Party campaigns against creeping privatisation in the NHS. It has never won a seat in Parliament, but its candidate Louise Irvine came second in then-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt\u0027s seat last year with 20% of the vote. Now the party is hoping to challenge Mr Rees-Mogg\u0027s 10,235 majority in North East Somerset.

After meeting families facing eviction in Glasgow, he said Labour would end the “ugly and discredited” system of privatisation. Hundreds of people could be locked out of their homes if Serco presses ahead with its plans to change the locks.

Mr Corbyn said the treatment of the refugees was “appalling.” “This is not how our country should treat people seeking help,” he said. He added: “It is time for the Tories to end the failed privatisation agenda that is putting the public in danger. “Time and again private profit is put ahead of the public interest. This has to end. Asylum seekers who have fled horrific conflict and violence, and have since made the UK their home, deserve our help and support, not persecution from profiteering private companies. “Private firms have no business profiting from the detention of refugees and asylum seekers and we will end the ugly and discredited system of private firms running immigration detention centres.

The MP will give the Alternative MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival setting out ideas for “building a free and democratic media for the digital age” if he becomes Prime Minister. He will argue that the country needs to look at ways to democratise the BBC so it is freer from government influence, more accountable to the public and more representative of the country it serves. In a plan for the future of the BBC, he said there should be:  The election of some of the BBC board members by staff and licence fee payers, and the reduction or removal of the government’s powers of appointment Complete transparency about the diversity and make-up of the BBC workforce Placing the BBC on a permanent statutory footing to end government control through charter renewal The introduction of a digital licence fee, payable by tech giants or through internet service providers, to supplement the current TV licence fee and reduce the cost for poorer households.   On putting the BBC on a permanent, independent footing and the introduction of a digital licence fee, Jeremy Corbyn will tell the TV Festival: “If we want an independent BBC, we should consider setting it free by placing it on a permanent statutory footing, with a new independent body setting the licence fee.  “The licence fee itself is another potential area for modernisation. In the digital age, we should consider whether a digital licence fee could be a fairer and more effective way to fund the BBC.  “A digital licence fee, supplementing the existing licence fee, collected from tech giants and Internet Service Providers, who extract huge wealth from our shared digital space, could allow a democratized and more plural BBC to compete far more effectively with the private multinational digital giants like Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook .  This could also help reduce the cost of the licence fee for poorer households.”  On complete transparency of the BBC workforce’s makeup, Corbyn will add: “The BBC could lead the way by setting best practice with complete transparency on the makeup of its workforce by publishing equality data, including for social class, for all creators of BBC content, whether in-house or external.” And on elections to the BBC board, Jeremy Corbyn will say: “One proposal would simultaneously reduce government political influence on the BBC while empowering its workforce and license fee payers. That would see some elections of places to the BBC Board, for example of executive directors by staff and non-executive directors by licence fee payers. “To help decentralise the BBC, national and regional boards could be expanded, with election by BBC staff and local licence fee payers. All boards should be representative of the country, with a minimum representation for women and minority groups.” "},{"url":null,"title":"no barack obamas campaign finance","story":"NewsNo, Barack Obama\u0027s campaign finance violation wasn\u0027t the same thing as Donald Trump\u0027sThe President finally responded to Michael Cohen\u0027s guilty plea - but claimed his predecessor had done bad things tooShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter15:54, 22 AUG 2018Updated17:29, 22 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDonald Trump finally responded to Michael Cohen\u0027s guilty plea today, after his former lawyer admitted to felony crimes designed to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Cohen implicated the President in two counts of campaign finance violations - saying he had been acting under the instruction of his client, then candidate Trump. But in his first response since the news broke last night, Trump sought to shift discussion away from his own alleged crimes and onto his predecessor. He equated the violations to fines issued to Barack Obama\u0027s election campaign after the 2008 Presidential election.   But are the two comparable? Here\u0027s everything you need to know. What was Barack Obama\u0027s campaign fined for?  Essentially, their paperwork wasn\u0027t up to snuff. The Obama campaign was fined by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for failing to file a series of \u002748-hour notices\u0027 on their donations. Candidates are required to file any donations above $1,000 taken within 20 days of the election, and must file them within 48 hours of receiving them. When the FEC audited the campaign, they found they had failed to file notices in good time for 1,300 donations, worth around $1.8 million. The campaign was fined $375,000 for the violation. While it was among the highest fines ever doled out by the watchdog, the campaign paid up, it wasn\u0027t covered up, and so wasn\u0027t treated as a crime. What did Michael Cohen admit to last night?  He admitted - and implicated the US President in - a felony conspiracy to influence the outcome of an election by paying women hush money. Michael Cohen said in court that he had arranged payments to two women who claimed to have had affairs with his client - Trump - in order to buy their silence. He said he was acting under instructions from the President. And he said he arranged to make the payments for (the) principal purpose of influencing (the) election.

It comes as research shows the region is expected to lose 10% of GDP over the next decade under a disastrous “no deal” scenario, meaning every man, woman and child in the North East would be \u0026pound3,000 a year worse off. The region was overwhelmingly in favour of Brexit when the UK voted two years ago with only Newcastle voting narrowly to stay. But research suggests the tide has changed drammatically fuelled partly by younger voters and also by Labour voters changing their mind. The latest poll, carried out by YouGov on behalf of the People’s Vote campaign shows strong support for a vote on any final Brexit deal which is now favoured by a margin of 40 to 35%.  But if talks break down, or there is no agreement on a Brexit deal, 54% would back the public being given the final say against just 22%who say MPs should the take the decision. By almost two-to-one, 41-22% voters in the region expect Brexit to be bad for the economy. Peter Kellner, one of Britain’s most respected pollsters and a former president of YouGov, said: “The swing in the North East is higher than the national average and there is a clear reason for this. The region is more strongly Labour than any other: the party has 26 of the North East’s 29 MPs.  “And while the views of the relatively small number of Conservative voters towards Brexit are virtually unchanged, Labour voters have moved from 59 per cent to 68 per cent Remain.” Campaigners for a vote for the final deal believe the electorate are realising the potential dangers of a botched Brexit. Research shows more than \u0026pound595 million of EU funding for North East businesses and projects through Regional Development Funds and \u0026pound494 million in Structural funds are at risk from a botched Brexit.  There are also concerns that the area which boasts such attractions as Alwnick castle in Northumbria and the Sage in Gateshead may miss out on some of the 274,000 tourists from Europe who may choose to go elsewhere each year. Over 25,300 people in the North East are directly employed in tourism as their main or second jobs, while EU tourists to the North East spent \u0026pound90 million on regional products and attractions in 2014.

But the Tories are said to be hiding Belfast energy plans because they are so “incendiary”.  Business Secretary Greg Clark is believed to have had urgent talks in Dublin on a deal to keep the lights on in Northern Ireland. Tomorrow Brexit Minister Dominic Raab is expected to play down announcements as part of the duty of “a responsible government, to plan for every eventuality”.

But doesn’t that all require a bit too much, well, effort? Never fear, these tips from BBC Focus magazine can help you greenify your life \u0026shywithout breaking a sweat. 1 Don’t wash your clothes  Or at least, not so often. A single load of laundry generates 600g of CO2, even if you wash at 30\u0026degC and dry it on the washing line. Tumble drying triples this. But the United Nations Environment Program and Levi’s Jeans both agree you can wear trousers and skirts at least five times before washing them. The same goes for wool and synthetic sweaters, jackets and sweatshirts. If every household in the UK saved a whole laundry load per week, we would slash CO2 emissions by 840,000 tonnes a year. For ordinary laundry, halving the amount of detergent will leave your clothes just as clean while reducing the phosphates that end up in our rivers.   2 Use a milkman  Supermarkets will only sell you milk in plastic jugs, or cartons made of laminated cardboard and plastic. But local milk delivery companies, such as milkandmore, are bringing the glass milk bottle back to our doorsteps. Glass takes half as much energy to produce per tonne as it did 30 years ago. Returning milk bottles is also greener than recycling plastic bottles.   3 Use a dishwasher  Washing up by hand can use less energy than running a dishwasher, but only with an efficient technique. If you rinse the dishes under a hot tap and change the water in the bowl a few times, your handwashing session can generate 8kg of CO2, compared with 1kg for a dishwasher cycle at 65\u0026degC. Using the dishwasher’s ‘eco’ cycle will drop the washing temperature to 55\u0026degC and this reduces the carbon footprint by another 20%. Remember, though, that dishwashers are only efficient when fully loaded.   4 Move in together  A 2015 study at Dickinson College, Pennsylvania, found that living with someone reduces your overall carbon footprint by 23%, compared with living alone. Part of this is the obvious energy saving of heating just one house, not two. Couples who live together also don’t tend to go out in the evening as much, which cuts down on travel emissions.  5 Don’t mow your lawn so often  Although growing plants absorb CO2, a perfectly manicured lawn actually generates more greenhouse gases than it absorbs. An electric mower used for an hour, once a week through the growing season, results in an extra 15kg of CO2 a year. Adding nitrogen-based lawn feeder makes things worse because some of the fertiliser breaks down to nitrous oxide which is 300 times more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2.   6 Drive slower  Driving at 60mph instead of 70mph on the motorway uses 10% less fuel but has negligible impact on your journey time. On empty roads, a journey from Bristol to London would take an extra 16 minutes. Many drivers accelerate up to the car in front, then brake, before accelerating away again. This driving style is much more stressful and uses more fuel. If every UK driver slowed down to 60mph it could save 810,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. That’s what a small gas-fired power station creates.  7 Work from home   The average commute time is 27 minutes each way. That’s almost an hour that could have been spent in bed or with your family if you worked from home. Studies have also found homeworkers take 1.8  sick days per year, against 3.1 for office-based  staff. Staying at home obviously reduces your total car miles, but companies with lots of home workers can also manage with smaller offices, which saves on heating and air conditioning costs. Overall, working from home just three days a week reduces your carbon footprint by the equivalent of four tonnes of CO2 a year.   8 Bank online  The UK financial sector generates 160g of CO2 for every \u0026pound1 we pay them in mortgage payments, loans, etc. Even though their business mostly consists of electronic data transfers, they use energy to run branches and offices. Banking online reduces the number of branches a bank needs. Security vans can make fewer trips to refill cashpoints if you pay with a card or phone. Plus, 10% of the financial sector’s carbon footprint goes on printing and postage, so opting out of paper statements cuts emissions too.

Even so, there are still some unusual rules that can land you in hot water if you’re not aware of them. Here are six laws that could affect each and every driver in the UK - but which you might not have known about... Offence 1: Splashing pedestrians    It’s infuriating when it happens: getting drenched from head to toe in muddy water after a careless road user drives through a puddle. Worse still is the fact that it’s not always accidental. We’ve all wished we could see justice for this type of driver, but in actual fact they are breaking the law and the penalty is pretty severe. Under section three of the Road Traffic Act 1988, it is an offence to drive “without reasonable consideration for other persons”, and this includes any instance of “driving through a puddle causing pedestrians to be splashed”.   The maximum punishment is a level five fine of \u0026pound5,000 in instances where driving “amounts to a clear act of incompetence, selfishness, impatience or aggressiveness”. You are more likely to be be issued with a \u0026pound100 fixed penalty notice and three penalty points if you are caught. But if you refuse to pay and take the matter to court you could see a maximum fine of \u0026pound5,000 imposed. Offence 2: Buying from a drive-through using your smartphone We all know that using our phones while driving is strictly forbidden, and quite rightly so. But what is sometimes forgotten is that this rule also applies on private roads and land where the public has access. Feel like paying for your tasty takeaway or refreshing iced coffee using contactless on your smartphone? Think again. While it would take a particularly strict law enforcement officer to penalise you for this crime, it is technically possible for an officer to issue a fixed penalty of \u0026pound200 and give you six penalty points.  Halfords tip: If you have to use your phone to pay it might be better to park up and walk into the restaurant. However, if you need a sat nav, remember that touching your phone when driving is still illegal. A better option is to invest in a Garmin Drive 50 Sat Nav, \u0026pound89.99 (save \u0026pound10) which you can use within the law. As well as preloaded lifetime maps of the UK and Ireland, it\u0027s packed with added features that will help you reach your destination safely. The driver awareness features include alerts for dangerous curves, fatigue warnings, speed changes, wrong way on a one- way, railroad crossings, animal crossings, and more. Offence 3: Leaving your engine running    One of the more surprising rules of the road is that you must have your engine switched off when stationary. This law was not, originally, to prevent pollution - it was designed to reduce noise. The fine is \u0026pound20, although in London it could be higher (up to \u0026pound80) because of strict emissions rules. The law itself dates from the 1986 Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Act, but it doesn\u0027t mean you have to turn off your engine when in a traffic jam or stopped at lights. That said, if you’re stuck for a while, switching off is a great idea. Halfords tip: Switching off your engine will save fuel and money, so make sure you do it whenever you can. You do, however, need to make sure that your car battery is in good working order. Visit a Halfords Autocentre for a Free Battery Check to make sure you can start your car easily, every time. Many modern cars have start/stop technology which automatically stops and restarts your engine when stopped at lights or queuing in traffic. This requires special heavy duty batteries - a Halfords expert can help you pick exactly the right battery for your car. Offence 4: Sleeping in your car    We all know that drinking and driving a car isn\u0027t acceptable, but if you find yourself stuck after a night of heavy drinking then you might be tempted to sleep in your car. This may seem like a sensible idea if there’s no other way to get home, but it’s actually illegal and you can be prosecuted for being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle. It doesn’t matter if the keys are out of the ignition and you’re sat in the backseat, you could face a fine and a maximum of ten penalty points.  Halfords tip: Instead of sleeping in your car, grab the Two Person Dome Tent, above, for \u0026pound12 (save \u0026pound18), and Envelope Sleeping Bag, \u0026pound8 (save \u0026pound12). A little camping trip is way more fun than trying to sleep in a cramped car. You might also want to keep a top-up battery in your car for emergencies and impromptu camping trips. The Juice Power Station, \u0026pound25, (save \u0026pound5) has enough capacity to recharge a phone multiple times and will stay charged for up to six months. Offence 5: Using a phone in the passenger seat    Using your phone while driving is illegal and if you\u0027re caught you can get six points and a \u0026pound200 fine. But what a lot of people don\u0027t realise is that this same law applies to anyone teaching a learner driver too. Learners need to be supervised at all times and so the law takes a dim view of their instructors - professional or not - being distracted by mobile phones. So no witty social media updates and absolutely no Spotify playlist curation while you\u0027re teaching someone to drive. The answer, therefore, is the same as it would be for anyone driving a car. Either keep your phone in your pocket, bag or invest in a mobile phone holder. Mounting the phone to the windscreen keeps you legal although the drivers view must not be obstructed. Halfords colleagues can fit a car mount for you making sure it’s in the right place. Once that’s done, you’re good to use your phone to give your learner driver directions from your sat nav.  Halfords tip: The Belkin Dash or Window Mount, above, is a good solution to this problem. It\u0027s just \u0026pound20, which is a lot less than the \u0026pound200 fine, and its got extendable arms to fit any phone up to 6-inches in size. Offence 6: Driving with a broken brake light If your vehicle has something wrong with it, e.g. a broken brake light or no screenwash, the police may give you a ‘vehicle defect rectification notice’. You’ll need to get your vehicle fixed and provide proof that it’s been fixed (for example, a receipt for the work from a technician). You have 14 days from the date of the notice to show the proof to the police.

He had hired the \u0026pound160,000 supercar earlier this month but set off every speed camera on a busy dual-carriageway. The car rental company seized Farah\u0027s passport and he had to fork out \u0026pound26,000 to retrieve it.  But police arrested the Brit at the airport this week on suspicion of damaging the car, and he has spent days in a prison cell. Farah is now under house arrest in a hotel. His brother Adman Hashi, 50, said: Unbeknown to us, when they were returning the passport, they opened a case in the Dubai courts for vehicle damage and vehicle rental. Farah, unbeknown to him, was going to the airport after he got his passport, paid the ticket, and was told there was a case against him. His passport was taken and he was thrown into jail.  He was there for the first two days in the jail, now he\u0027s under house arrest in his hotel. Dubai courts do listen. I believe they have opened this case unlawfully.

Max Poshteh, 22, first met Louisa Chubb, then aged 25, two years ago as he browsed sex worker websites.  The pair met up at a Kensington hotel twice for sex sessions in 2016 after Poshteh had Googled adultwork and found Ms Chubb\u0027s profile, Inner London Crown Court heard.  They became friends and socialised over drinks and lunches and when Ms Chubb came into financial hardship Poshteh gave her \u0026pound10,000 to pay her rent and bills. When the escort began to feel pressured by the student she told him not to contact her.  Poshteh then started creating fake accounts on social media in a harassment campaign from October to December last year, prosecutors claim. On one account, named \u0027Sam Bloggs\u0027, he forwarded a \u0027sex review\u0027 by one of Ms Chubb\u0027s clients to her mother along with pictures from her site exposing her as a sex worker, the court heard. Police went to Poshteh\u0027s Chelsea home on October 26 last year and issued him with a harassment warning. But that same evening he phoned the grandfather of Ms Chubb, John Chubb, who lives in Devon, claiming to be a debt collector who needed to get in touch with her father Jason Chubb, prosecutors allege. Paul Fairley, prosecuting told jurors: There are going to be aspects of this case that some of you may find distasteful. Louisa Chubb is and was at the time an escort. She advertised her services on this adult website.  Max Poshteh met the complainant because he wanted the services of an escort. They met up and on two occasions and had a client-escort relationship. They appear to have been friends for a little while. During the course of that time the defendant appears to be fairly flush, he began to give Ms Chubb money not simply for her services, but he decided to pay her rent and put money towards bills. It appears from text messages the he appears to have some feelings for her. No doubt she was happy that he was looking to take care of her and that he was essentially making things easier for her. Then he started to get a bit weird with her. It appears he had given her about \u0026pound10,000 over a period of about 18 months. There are loads of text messages relating to the money and her saying she will pay him back and him saying No, you don\u0027t owe me anything.

The Madley family splashed out \u0026pound3,000 on the two-week trip to make amazing family memories - but instead they said it was unforgettable for all the the wrong reasons. The say they were forced to paddle through water every day after heavy rain brought down part of the ceiling at the Bahia Principe Coba Hotel in Riviera Maya, Yucatan. And they say nine-year-old Madison suffered a head injury after slipping on a wet floor during their stay.  To make matters worse, Scott, 29, says he contracted cyclospora, a tropical bug known as \u0027traveller\u0027s diarrhoea\u0027. The British Gas engineer claims the coffee machine, fridge and spa bath in their room was faulty, the air conditioning only worked intermittently, and the beach was smelly and bore little resemblance to the glossy brochure pictures. He and his wife, Tammy, 27, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, are demanding that holiday firm TUI urgently investigate what went wrong for the health and safety of other holidaymakers.  Scott took to social media at the weekend to vent his frustration at the holiday company and share pictures of the hotel after their holiday in June. He wrote: Upon arrival our room was flooded. We reported it immediately and it was mopped out. It became apparent that the leak was coming through the ceiling and a simple mop up wasn\u0027t going to solve the issue. I reported it to the TUI representative who was not interested and stated everyone has room problems. He added: Then a few days later at 5:30am I was woken by a loud crash. The ceiling had fallen down. The same one I had been reporting. Scott added that it took a full day for the ceiling collapsed to be cleared up, and that water was still coming through the family\u0027s hotel room ceiling.  We had to paddle through water in our room and waste all our towels daily to try to make the floor not so slippy. Two days before we were due to come home our nine-year-old daughter had an accident going to the bathroom - due to the flooded floor. Upon returning home I then have a confirmed case of cyclospora. Scott attached a photograph of the hotel corridor when the ceiling had collapsed, left debris all over the floor and a gaping hole above. In other images taken by the family during their stay, water can be seen dripping through the light fitting in the bathroom and show soggy towels strewn across the floor in an attempt to mop it up.  Speaking today, Scott said: Safe to say all in all the holiday was a complete disaster.  This was supposed to be a time of relaxation and making memories. Not mopping up water and wasting our time constantly reporting issues and waiting for people that never turn up along with accidents. I will be looking to start legal proceedings if they do not have this investigated properly and provide me with a satisfactory response and resolution. Scott added that the family had to deal with many other problems which he believes were caused by the leaks - including constant dripping from the ceiling, intermittent air con and flickering lights. He said: It was interesting that all the electrical appliances within the room appeared to be faulty when water was leaking through. It was probably the cause of all this.  On his tropical bug, Scott said: I went to the doctors and got antibiotics, took stool samples for parasites and disease. The main ones came back and nothing was found. The doctor advised a lot of cases of Cyclospora have been reported and symptoms stemmed towards it being this. I had severe stomach cramps and diarrhoea and ended up taking three weeks off work. I\u0027m still not great now. But much better than I was. The family were also annoyed by the pictures used by the travel company to advertise the Mexican resort against what it actually looked like, which they said was a beach covered in seaweed and was rotten.

Cheryl Halliburton, 27, has suffered from severe eczema flare-ups on her face and neck every few days, after falling pregnant with her daughter Alexis, now three. The skin condition left Cheryl with red, sore skin, that cracked open, causing sore, open wounds, and made her so ill and self-conscious she would be left unable to leave the house. At her wit\u0027s end Cheryl decided to try CBD oil, a naturally occurring cannabinoid found in cannabis, and found it had a remarkable effect on her skin after inhaling the natural remedy through a vape pen. Cheryl, a careworker from Elgin, Scotland, said: It really began when I fell pregnant with Alexis when I was around 23 years old.  It started on my back and cleared up after a course of steroids but straight away it flared up on my face and neck and has been constant ever since. It would flare up every couple of days depending on what I was eating and it would be an uncontrollable itch and no cream I put on it would soothe it, in fact, it would often make it worse. I would feel like I wanted to rip my skin off.  I felt like I couldn\u0027t go on anymore as I was just not getting any answers from the doctors. On bad days I wasn\u0027t even able to take my daughter to nursery or would be unable to work or leave the house and a combination of antihistamine and painkillers would make me drowsy. Cheryl had eczema as a child, but quickly grew out of it and believes that the hormone imbalance in her body from her pregnancy kicked started the sore and itchy skin condition. Struggling to find the ongoing cause of her eczema, Cheryl attending endless amounts of GP appointments where she was continuously given courses of steroids tablets, light treatment and blood tests. Cheryl was left unable to wear make-up or go on nights out with friends because she feared eating the wrong thing or drinking alcohol could cause her skin to react. It wasn\u0027t until August 2 this year, that Cheryl\u0027s flare-ups got out of control and she was rushed to Dr Gray\u0027s Hospital in Elgin by concerned husband, Craig, 32, who told his wife he could no longer see her suffer.

Princess Diana\u0027s former butler Paul Burrell has said he thinks Prince Harry is taking a leaf out of his mother\u0027s book by freezing Meghan\u0027s dad out. The 60-year-old described how Diana would have been furious if someone had betrayed her trust in the way Thomas Markle has - and causing the newlyweds problems.  In this week\u0027s New! magazine, he said: I\u0027ve been in similar situations where people said things about Princess Diana, and the way she dealt with it was by freezing them out. It looks as if Harry has taken a leaf out of his mother\u0027s book. Diana said, \u0027Once someone burns the bridge of trust towards you it\u0027s very hard to repair it.

David Challenor has been locked up for 22 years after playing out his sadomasochistic fantasies on the child, who he had claimed was a fantasist. The married 50-year-old subjected his young victim to a horrific campaign of abuse, which also included whipping her and putting pegs on her body. He would dress up as a small girl in adult-sized baby dresses and nappies before carrying out the sickening attacks at his home, a court heard. Police searched his property and found bondage gear including sex aids, gaffer tape, dummies, a stun gun and ropes hanging from the beam in his attic.  He even took trophy photos of the abuse carried out on the child - who cannot be legally named - which included attaching clips to give her electric shocks. Challenor accused the girl of being a a liar when he was arrested, but officers found the gruesome attic kitted out just as the youngster had described. The defendant, of Coventry, West Midlands, pleaded not guilty to charges including false imprisonment, rape, gross indecency, assault by penetration, indecent assault and assault causing her actual bodily harm. He also denied taking indecent images of her, making indecent images of children by downloading them, and possessing prohibited images. But after nine hours at the end of an 11-day trial, jurors unanimously found him guilty of all but one of the charges of taking indecent images. Sentencing Challenor on Monday, Recorder Nicholas Syfret QC said: It is hard to comprehend how you could behave with such depravity. The harm done by you to her is hard to overestimate.  Prosecutor Andrew Wallace told Warwick Crown Court that most of the charges related to the ordeal to which Challenor subjected one girl. The youngster lived in Coventry at the time, the court heard. He told jurors: The defendant will call her a fantasist and a liar about the allegations, but she made them before the police went to the defendant\u0027s house and made a search. Mr Wallace said Challenor had various sexual fetishes and fantasies including dressing up as a small girl himself. Pretending to be a little girl called Lucy, when the victim was at his home he took her to the attic where he asked her \u0027to do things to him\u0027. This included performing oral sex, the court heard. After leaving, the youngster was initially too frightened to tell anyone what Challenor had done - but eventually did so. She confided in someone what had happened, which was reported to the police who interviewed her towards the end of 2015.

Brave little Elsie May was seen perched on the beautiful carriage, wearing Hull City FC\u0027s colours, as she made her way to her brother Stanley Metcalf\u0027s funeral.  The youngster absolutely loved her twin and would do everything with him.  And this morning, she made sure she was by football-mad Stanley\u0027s side as his coffin was carried to Chanterlands Avenue Crematorium in Hull.  She waved to their family when she spotted them in the crowd. Stanley was found fatally injured at a property in Sproatley, East Yorkshire, on July 26 after he was shot in the abdomen in a pellet gun accident.  He tragically died in hospital later the same day.  Many of his close friends and family donned the amber-and-black shirts of his favourite football team as they bid him a final, emotional farewell. A pair of white horses, draped in flags of the same colours, pulled the white carriage carrying Stanley\u0027s coffin and Elsie May to his funeral service.  On the side of the hearse, stunning yellow flowers spelled out \u0027STANLEY\u0027.  The coffin passed four Star Wars stormtroopers, Iron Man and Captain America as it was carried into the crematorium\u0027s grounds by the horses.  There, Stanley\u0027s grieving loved ones had gathered to say goodbye.   The film characters led the cortege through the grounds to the service, before standing guard as the youngster\u0027s coffin was carried into the chapel. Many mourners shed tears and were inconsolable.  The service was to be followed by a \u0027fun day\u0027 event in the city.  In a statement issued through Humberside Police ahead of the funeral, Stanley\u0027s family said: We are absolutely devastated and completely heartbroken without Stanley and it still doesn\u0027t feel real we won\u0027t see his happy, smiling face again.  There are no real words to express how the loss of Stanley has affected us and we all miss him so much. He was so vibrant and full of energy, a typical six-year-old boy who just wanted to have fun and enjoy life, and he adored playing football.  They added: The condolences and support we have received have been incredibly touching and we would like to thank everyone, friends, the general public and the media, for their kind words and sensitivity during what is such an emotional and devastating time for us. Stanley\u0027s funeral will be a day dedicated to him and for him, he is all that matters. The statement concluded: Stanley was a loving, caring and beautiful boy, and there is a huge gap in all our lives now that will just never be filled. Last month, Stanley\u0027s great-grandmother had revealed the heartbreak the family faced in telling Elsie May that her twin had died.  She said the pair were extremely close. “His sister absolutely loved him to bits and they would do everything together, said the 84-year-old, who asked to remain anonymous. I don\u0027t know how you\u0027re supposed to explain things like that to a six-year-old girl.  She added: “I\u0027ve just been in floods of tears ever since it happened, I couldn\u0027t even sleep last night, just thinking about him and how tragic it all is.” Stanley, described by loved ones as a beautiful boy inside and out, had been visiting family in Sproatley when he suffered the pellet gun injury.  He was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary, but died hours later.  The \u0027fun day\u0027 event was due to be held at Hull\u0027s St Mary\u0027s Queen of Martyrs Academy this afternoon instead of a wake, the Hull Daily Mail reported.  Organiser Kayleigh Pepper earlier said: Stanley\u0027s family have made the decision not to have a wake as we know it but to celebrate his life in doing something that represents everything he stood for. The fun day will begin at 12.30pm, straight after Stanley\u0027s service and Jenny and Andy (Stanley\u0027s mum and dad) have one request and that is for it to be as fun as it possibly can.

Usually found in far-flung tropical countries, there have been no previous cases of the rare STI Donovanosis recorded in the UK. That is until now. The nasty bug causes genital ulcers to grow and spread. If left untreated flesh in the groin literally starts to eat itself. And according to a Freedom of Information request, submitted by online pharmacy chemist-4-u, the rare sexually transmitted disease Donovanosis has been diagnosed three times. Twice in Bolton and once in a woman, between the age of 15 and 25, in Southport in the past 12 months.  Although Donovanosis itself can be treated with antibiotics, time is of the essence. Infections typically occur in the genital area, but they can also appear around the nose, mouth and chest. In all, there are four types of Donovanosis to be aware of. The first is fleshy red ulcers that bleed when touched, known as ulcerogranulomatous. Secondly, a dry ulcer with a raised, uneven edge, this is known as the hypertrophic or verrucous type. A necrotic infection is deep and foul smelling and causes severe damage to the tissues. A sclerotic or cicatricial infection is a dry lesion with scar tissue. Sex with an infected person is not the only means of catching the disease, which is twice as likely to affect men than women.  Simple contact with a victim\u0027s bleeding ulcer is enough for it to be passed on and symptoms can show one to 12 weeks after coming into contact with the bacteria. And without treatment, the ulcers increase in size and other bacteria can also attack the ulcers which then generate a foul smell. Half of infected men and women have sores in the anal area, which appear as small, red, beefy lumps. The bumps gradually erode but as the disease spreads it starts to destroy tissues in the infected area. There are also possible complications involved in contracting the disease, which can include permanent genital damage and scarring, loss of skin colour and irreversible genital swelling due to the scarring. The disease is usually found in tropical and subtropical countries such as southeast India, Guyana and New Guinea, and due to its rarity in Britain it doesn\u0027t appear on most STI lists, compiled by UK sexual health websites. But it\u0027s now far from being contained to far-flung places and instead is making a comeback in Australia and South Africa too. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) said it has not found any previous cases in the UK.

It was underneath this clutter, in a house in America, that one student discovered the find of a lifetime. There he found a silver 1981 Lamborghini Countach and a red Ferrari 308. Together the cars could have a value of around $430,000. Posting photos of his find on Reddit under the name Eriegin, the unnamed student said the cars had sat there unused for over 20 years.  My late grandpa bought it (the Lamborghini) for his exotic car rental business in 1989, but after insurance costs became too high for him to operate the company, he kept the car (and many others including the Ferrari 308 in front of the Lambo) outside/in leaky garages for 20+ years instead of selling them. Don’t ask me why, I have no clue. The two 80s supercars have sat untouched and out of sight for decades, under dust-sheets and piles of junk. Keen-eyed car fans will recognise the Lamborghini as similar to the one driven by Leonardo DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street, while the red Ferrari is a similar model to the one used by Tom Selleck in Magnum PI.  The revelation prompted hundreds of Reddit users to ask how the cars had got there, why they were left and if either would be for sale. User Eriegin said: I totally agree, this kind of car abuse hurts my soul. But it’s also kind of incredible and rare to see something so beautiful (and valuable) in this condition. I definitely feel bad that it’s been hidden away in the garage in this condition for so long, and will probably continue to be if we keep it in the family. But I also (selfishly) hope that it stays there until someone in the family has the means to do it up, however long that may take. Seeing it in her garage like this was unreal. She also let slip his car-collecting grandad once owned a 1955 Mercedes (Gullwing), a car so collectible it\u0027s thought to be worth upwards of $5 million. She said there were no firm plans to sell the cars yet, but admitted they could be open to offers.

Instead, there was a huge, very lightly grilled mushroom next to it. John, 42, from Cheltenham, Glouchestershire, said: Myself and a colleague stopped for breakfast, and it took a few moments for it to sink in it wasn\u0027t a joke.

The girl managed to stay on the bike after the collision and hung on as it drifted across three lanes towards a lorry. The out-of-control bike travelled nearly 820ft (250m) on its own - narrowly missing the lorry as it slowed down - before it hit a barrier and toppled over. The girl was thrown off but she escaped with only a few scratches.  Dramatic dashcam footage, recorded by a vehicle following behind, captured the incident on a motorway near Bangalore, India on Sunday. It shows a white car changing lanes as a motorbike carrying the five-year-old girl, her mother and her father, who was driving, approaches at speed from behind in a bid to overtake it. The bike moves closer to a concrete barrier but ploughs into a motorbike that was travelling at a slower speed.  The parents are thrown off the bike and land on the motorway, where their bodies roll along the Tumakuru-Bengaluru Highway like rag dolls. The driver of the other motorbike is also knocked to the floor. The bike carrying the five-year-old girl stays upright and begins to drift across the other lanes as she clings to the fuel tank.

Kay was rescued after treading water for 10 hours 60 miles from land and insists she fell. But Kelly Rayment who split with electrician Craig, 43, after their volatile relationship fell apart, said bluntly: “If I was on a ship with him I would get off any way I could.” The mum-of-two, 38, added acidly: “Craig’s not a very nice person when he’s been drinking. “So him going on a cruise is a recipe for disaster. I can imagine what she went through.”  Kelly had been married to Craig for a year when they moved to Spain’s Costa del Sol. But she left him after constant rows and they are now in the process of divorcing. She added: “I’m proud of myself for building up the courage to leave him and saying no when he begged me to come back.”  Kelly says she passed a warning to Kay, 46, after the air hostess began dating Craig last year. She has sons aged 14 and 21 from a previous relationship and met Craig while a barmaid in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Passengers on the Norwegian Star, on a cruise in the Adriatic, say Kay and Craig had a drunken row before Kay plunged from the seventh deck on Saturday night. CCTV shows her alone at the time. Kay was finally rescued by a Croatian coast guard vessel on Sunday morning. The couple moved in together last November and are said to be living near Marbella.

It was just a terrible performance from the start.“I thought we were slack, very poor in possession.“Ayr had several early corners that put us on the back foot, there were bits of the first half where we got going but it really wasn’t good enough.“As a team, it’s not often I’ve seen so many players off form in one game. It was the polar opposite of Aberdeen last week, against the second best team in the country for the last few years, where we more than matched them.“The players can’t just take plaudits for how well they play and miss chances and then turn in a performance like that, it’s just not acceptable.”Striker Sofien Moussa was dropped to the bench after a poor run in front of goal but did his chances of a reprieve no good whatsoever after his introduction from the dugout.Within 15 minutes of replacing Jean Mendy, Moussa’s continual fouling caught up with him as referee John Beaton gave him his marching orders after a barge on Ayr midfielder Mark Kerr.And to cap things off, centre-back Genseric Kusunga was shown a straight red with the final kick of the game, scything down Michael Moffat in injury time.Neil added: “It was really poor from him, really poor from Gense.“I told Moussa that he can’t be making silly fouls, especially the one where he dived in to try to make a tackle on a yellow card.“It was a very dangerous game and he was warned and then paid the price for a poor challenge.“Then Gense obviously lost his composure and got a straight red which hurts us for this weekend, adding insult to injury.“Moussa had a great impact on the game, getting sent off, but, on the whole, our performance had a greater impact from start to finish, just not good enough.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba looks to make signings after taking dundee united squad to aviemore for team bonding","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United boss Csaba Laszlo could still add to his squad before the transfer window closes next week.Over a summer of major change, Csaba has already brought in 13 new players but has repeatedly said he would like to keep part of his budget for near the end of the window.He is still looking at the market and it’s understood there are a number of options he could pursue between now and the final day of business on Friday week.At the weekend there was down time, but not free time for Csaba’s squad as they headed for the Highlands.With no game because of they were already out of the Betfred Cup, he took most of his first-team squad north to Aviemore for a team bonding session.This week it will be back to a normal routine as the build up to Saturday’s home clash with Partick Thistle steps up.Meanwhile, as United continue a forensic examination of the workings on the entire club, it’s been confirmed a number of scouts have been told their services are not being retained.A club spokesman said: “When Mike Martin became chairman earlier this year he said he would conduct a root and branch review of the whole club to improve all areas of the business.“This review includes our academy structure and specifically the resources needed to attain elite status within Project Brave.“The recent changes to our academy scouting network are part of this process.”Today saw the reserves’ league season kick off when boss Craig Easton took the second string west to face St Mirren at the Simple Digital Arena.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7bd8878bae0.jpg ","title":"green campaign kicks off with adults walking to dundee primary schools","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA campaign to encourage more people to choose green travel options in Dundee was launched at City Square yesterday.Entitled Go Safe Dundee, the initiative saw a group of adults walking to primary schools around the city to raise awareness of the need for pupils and families to consider more sustainable transport.Parents, councillors, council officials and police all set off from City Square at 8.15am.

We’ve got to give Ayr some credit but the defeat was down to us. We weren’t at it at all.“We knew their qualities and had watched them so it wasn’t about under-estimating them.“We just didn’t create enough and were second best for the whole game.“It might be a lesson for some of the new guys, the league is tough and you need to be ready every game.“I don’t even know what to say, to be honest – it’s a hard one to take and we have to pick ourselves up for a big game this weekend at St Johnstone.“We need three points there.”Focus turns completely to the league campaign now after the Betfred Cup disappointment and what has now become a huge game at St Johnstone.The Dark Blues picked up three wins from four against their Tayside rivals last campaign, including a much-needed first victory of the season.That came in mid-September – this time around Kamara is keen to help the side repeat that 3-2 victory by grabbing a first three points of the season.He added: “Hopefully we can repeat that.“We’ll just do our stuff on the training pitches for the week coming up and put our attention now on St Johnstone but we definitely have to look back on the game on Saturday, we can’t just forget about that performance.“There are always other games and it’s a long season ahead but it’s really hard to go out of the cup like that.“We’re always after a cup run so it’s a tough one to take.“We have to pick ourselves up but I know this team is capable of doing that.“We played some good football in the games before Ayr so we know what we are capable of.“The results haven’t gone our way, though, and it’s obvious Saturday just wasn’t good enough from us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"meekings grateful to dundee boss mccann for captaincy honour","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew Dundee captain Josh Meekings has thanked under-fire boss Neil McCann for trusting him with the armband.McCann has confirmed the former Inverness defender will lead out the Dens Park side for the remainder of the season after trying out eight other potential candidates during pre-season.The 25-year-old Englishman says he is grateful for the honour and has vowed to repay McCann \u0026#8211 who is coming under increasing pressure from fans following his side\u0026#8217s shock Betfred Cup exit to Ayr United on Saturday \u0026#8211 with improved performances.He said: \u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m grateful for the manager for pulling me in to tell me I\u0026#8217m going to captain the side.

He says, though, coming off was just a precaution after needing surgery on the same ankle last season.He said: “It was nothing too serious. I had a shot and rolled my ankle a bit and I’ve had previous with it, so it was a bit of a worry at the time. However, a good bit of rest and the physio saw it. I’ve trained this week and it’s good. I just need to keep an eye on it.”Now would be an unfortunate time for Spence to be ruled out of action after some impressive displays in the early-season games and particularly due to the level of competition in the position now at Dens Park.“Last year there were a lot of centre-mids but again this year we’re very strong there, one of the strongest areas in the team,” he added.“I think that’s good because it keeps everyone on their toes, you can’t slack because there will be somebody else to take your place.“I believe in my ability and I’ve worked hard over the summer, worked hard in pre-season, too.“Obviously, I’ve been in the position but Glen Kamara is to come back and you’ve got Adil Nabi, Paul McGowan, Elton Ngwatala and Kharl Madianga, so there’s a lot of competition in there. I think throughout the season it will be getting rotated round and, hopefully, I can be in that team.“I think I’ve done OK so far. It’s still early but I want to keep this up through the whole season.“Last year I played well in stages and then got injured so I want to play consistently every week, play as much as I can, and obviously help the team climb the table.”And the way to do that will be to start finding the net, something Spence is adamant that’ll change soon.“I think our luck will turn around.“We have to put some of these chances away, we all know that, but the main thing is we are creating chances.“One day it is going to click, something is just missing at the moment but we all believe in the guys up front to go and do it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united have to make tannadice a fortress to win back wait and see supporters","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAfter a difficult start to the season, something approaching a feelgood factor has returned to Dundee United following victory over Queen of the South in the Championship and a dramatic success against St Johnstone’s kids in the Irn-Bru Cup.This weekend the Tangerines will attempt to build on that by chalking up another success when Partick Thistle visit on the resumption of league hostilities.As well as a chance to build on the new-found momentum, the Jags clash will also be a chance for Csaba Laszlo’s players to send out a message that Tannadice is once again becoming a place where visits are to be feared, not anticipated and relished.While the general perception regarding the failure to secure promotion to the Premiership in each of the last two seasons has been poor away form has been the main cause, there is no question too many points have been let slip at home.In all competitions, last season saw United beaten five teams on their own patch. Three of those defeats came against Inverness Caley Thistle, Morton and Queen of the South in league outings.There were also draws against Dumbarton, Inverness and Dunfermline, meaning a total of 15 points that were expected to be taken were, in fact, shipped.That proved crucial as United finished 13 points behind champions St Mirren and one adrift of second-place Livingston, meaning they kicked off at the first stage of the promotion play-offs, while Livi had the benefit of a two-week break before beating them in the semi-final.Before last week’s Irn-Bru success with a side that was a mix of kids and fringe players, and against very young opposition, there was little to suggest this season would bring an improvement.Over 90 minutes, the Tannadice outings in the Betfred Cup against Arbroath and Alloa were drawn and the opening day of league business ended in a painful 3-2 defeat against Dunfermline that saw the Pars dominate more than the final score suggested.That United must improve at home start is important, not just in terms of their promotion challenge but also economically.The new regime under chairman Mike Martin have invested in a new squad and that’s cost money, some of which they’d like to think will be recouped by fans paying at the gate to watch their team chalk up regular victories at home.Decent income has already come from season ticket sales that are now approaching the 4,000 mark and, if that’s down on previous years, it remains a number that would be the envy of many Premiership clubs.It would be no surprise, however, if that cash has already been spent on the rebuilding of the squad, making supporters who pay on turning up for games a vital source of further funds.In not buying season books, many have adopted a wait-and-see policy so far as attendance is concerned. If United are going well they will come, if not, they’ll find something else to do.That makes wins at Tannadice vital and, in fairness, despite the problems the team’s experienced there in the past 12 months, there are now some encouraging signs.United looked impressive in Dumfries and could’ve scored more than the two goals.And in new arrivals Pavol Safranko, Nicky Clark and Craig Curran, they have strikers who bring as close as anyone is going to get of a guarantee of goals.A more direct style this term should also help, though, ultimately, the proof of this pudding is going to be in the eating.Hopefully, from Saturday the fans can start getting tucked in to what becomes a regular menu of home wins.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic queued for miles near dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTraffic is queuing for miles on the edge of Dundee this morning.The tailbacks are the result of a broken down lorry close to the Myrekirk roundabout.\u0026mdash Traffic Scotland (@trafficscotland) August 22, 2018An HGV has come into trouble in the middle lane of the A90.There is said to be delays stretching as far back as Longforgan.\u0026mdash Traffic Scotland (@trafficscotland) August 22, 2018The HGV was recovered at around 8.45am.Traffic is still said to be heavy, however Traffic Scotland said it should now begin to “ease”.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck - leaving serious burns."},{"url":null,"title":"summer-sessions-2018-glasgow-road-closures-in-place-around-bellahouston-park","story":"                          SOUTH side drivers have been warned of major disruption on the roads this week ahead of a Bellahouston Park festival."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-pride-board-member-steps-down-as-event-refunds-total-6500","story":"                          REFUNDS to Pride Glasgow revellers who were denied entry to the event last month totalled \u0026pound6,500."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-to-create-thousands-of-apprenticeships","story":"                          MCDONALD\u0026rsquoS has pledged to create 43,000 apprenticeships across Europe by 2025, including a substantial number in the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"popes-visit-an-opportunity-to-end-the-cover-ups","story":"                          THE Pope\u0027 visit to Ireland is an opportunity to end the cover-up of abuse, Sinn Fein\u0027 vice-president said."},{"url":null,"title":"summer-sessions-2018-forecast-ahead-of-bellahouston-park-event","story":"                          POURING rain and blustery winds won\u0027t dampen the spirits of hundreds of Summer Sessions revellers making their way to Bellahouston Park tonight."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-belle-and-sebastian-join-forces-with-scots-orchestra-for-one-off-show","story":"                          A GLASGOW band will join forces with Scotland\u0027s national orchestra to celebrate a new \u0026pound21million hospice."},{"url":null,"title":"orange-order-refuse-to-re-route-parade-away-from-church-forcing-council-to-impose-new-route","story":"                          THE ORANGE Order has refused to re-route a parade away from the church where a priest was allegedly attacked and faces having a new route imposed on it."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bridge-next-step-in-major-renfrewshire-development-project","story":"                          A NEW bridge over the Black Cart will connect cyclists and pedestrians to a major investment area being developed in Renfrewshire."},{"url":null,"title":"davis-cup-returns-to-the-emirates-arena-for-world-group-play-off","story":"                          THE Emirates Arena will play host to Great Britain\u0027 Davis Cup World Group play-off against Uzbekistan."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-traffic-news-road-closures-and-delays-as-city-hosts-two-major-events","story":"                          Motorists travelling into Glasgow are being warned to expect delays caused by extra traffic."},{"url":null,"title":"austin-lafferty-what-can-i-do-about-my-noisy-neighbours-and-how-can-i-get-my-money-back-from-an-unhelpful-retailer","story":"                          I BOUGHT a display cabinet from a furniture retailer.

project will not affect completion of the Aberdeen bypass, according to transport bosses.Transport Scotland confirmed remedial works are being carried out on the new River Don Bridge, near Dyce, which is part of the AWPR, after “minor defects” were found.North-east Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald has written to the Scottish Government calling for answers on whether the bypass completion date will be pushed back.But transport bosses claim the project “remains on schedule” for late autumn 2018, adding that contractor Balfour Beatty would pay for the additional costs.Mr Macdonald said: “This latest development will only reinforce concerns that the AWPR could be subject to further delay and it’s vital that the Scottish Government provide clarity on this matter.“The Scottish Government also need to be clear on the extent to which this will impact on the overall cost of the project and any implications for safety.“The bridges over the River Dee and River Don are clearly critical parts of the infrastructure of the AWPR and it is vital that the Scottish Government publishes its own assessment of the issues affecting the Don Crossing and their impact on the project as a whole.”It is understood the added costs could amount to millions – which would be met by the contractor – but Transport Scotland declined to give a figure for the works.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “The AWPR contract sets out a clear standard for the works on AWPR and the contractor is required to complete any necessary work to deliver this at no additional costs to the public purse.“Some concrete panels are being replaced after minor defects were identified as part of the rigorous quality control processes which are utilised across the project.“It is not unusual for minor defects to appear during the construction of major infrastructure projects.“The contractor will undertake the necessary remedial works, at no extra cost to the taxpayer.“There will be no safety implications for users of the AWPR, and the AWPR/B-T project remains on schedule to open to traffic by late autumn 2018.“The previous Cabinet Secretary reported the latest position with the AWPR/B-T project to parliament in March 2018 and Balfour Beatty’s interim results remain consistent with this.”Two main sections of the £745 million project – from Balmedie to Tipperty and Blackdog to Dyce – have already opened to traffic.Transport bosses said the new 7.5-mile section would benefit tens of thousands of drivers through enhanced safety, reduced congestion, improved journey time reliability and safer access to local areas and the wider public network.The project is still slated for an autumn completion, following a series of delays caused by bad weather and the collapse of Carillion, a contractor on the project.The overall project is expected to bring in an additional £6 billion to the north-east economy and create around 14,000 jobs over the next 30 years.Balfour Beatty declined to comment saying it

intervention at this weekend\u0026#8217s Great Aberdeen Run are to be given a helping hand.A church in the city is holding a service with a difference, aimed at athletes taking part in Sunday’s run.Organisers at Gilcomston Church, which is a stone’s throw from the event’s start and finish line on Union Street, are changing their Sunday service for one day to draw in athletes and their fans who will be cheering from the sidelines.Runners and race fans will be able to call into the church from 9am to pray for good luck or tuck into a free snack at the church’s cafe.Especially for the run, the church’s minister Jerry Middleton has given his sermon an athletics theme.His morning service will be on the subject of the call to challenge, starting your journey, running the race and winning the prize which, he said, is finding Jesus.The church’s administrator Rosie McKie said: “The Great Aberdeen Run is such a great occasion and fantastic for the city.“We’re aiming to make the service one that runners and people coming to support them can come in and out of the church whenever suits them throughout the morning.“The format of the Sunday service will be adjusted to make it easy for visitors to ‘pop in and pop out’ throughout the morning.“The service will be divided into five 10-minute segments, which will all make sense on their own, or as a whole.“We want to offer people the chance to take part in this brilliant event without missing out on a Sunday service.”Mr Middleton said of the event: “We are excited that the Great Aberdeen Run goes right past our front door and we see this as another chance to invite people to see inside our church.“We have many occasions throughout the week when the people of Aberdeen are invited into the church, but this is a great opportunity for local people and visitors to Aberdeen to see inside our building, to meet some of our members and to experience some of what happens here every Sunday morning.”Ms McKie added: “We try to be a bit different to other churches in that we have chairs rather than pews, and it’s very social on Sunday mornings.“People will be able to come into our cafe and enjoy a cup of tea and we’ll be open from 9am.“We will be providing free refreshments for race supporters throughout the day until around 1pm.“We did a similar thing last year and it was really popular with visitors – hopefully it will be even more popular again this time.”Thousands of runners are expected to turn out for Sunday’s run which has a 10km and a half-marathon route, as well as one-mile family run.Entries are now closed.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"meeting held to discuss future of aberdeen church earmarked for demolition","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDozens of people turned out to a meeting organised to determine the future of an Aberdeen church.Plans have been put forward to demolish Garthdee Parish Church and sell the land for development, with the inclusion of a new church building in its place at the existing site in Ramsay Gardens.Speaking on behalf of the Presbytery, Reverend Scott Rennie attended the busy meeting last night.He argued that selling the land on would be the best course of action for the congregation, due to dwindling numbers at services in recent years and expensive maintenance costs on the ageing building.Mr Rennie informed those attending that independent surveyors have determined the costs of fixing up the building would be around £110,000, and that another option available to the group would be to merge with Mannofield Church.However, Garthdee Community Council’s chairman Paul O’Connor spoke out against the plans, and argued that the building should be retained for the good of residents and worshippers.Mr Rennie said: “The Presbytery intends for new congregation to have a more modern, suitable and sustainable base here in the heart of this community for the long-term.“So, far from being a withdrawal from the Garthdee community, what we are seeking is a revitalisation of the church’s work, and its presence in Garthdee, through a strong commitment to the congregation.“We as a church want to put the resources we have into people and congregations in our communities, and put less of our resources into the upkeep of old buildings that are difficult to maintain and keep.”Mr O’Connor said: “When you look around this beautiful hall, it doesn’t look as if it’s falling to pieces to me – what it does need is some tender loving care.“If they knock this fantastic site down, and all of the memories that go along with it, how long would it take to build this new church? I don’t think it would be any less than two or three years.“If we can have a future and improve the numbers of the congregation in this shiny new building, what’s to stop us from doing the exact same in the one that we already have?”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"museums 20th year celebration exhibition","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA north-east museum is celebrating its 20th year – with an exhibition of how much has changed.The Insch Connection Museum, located in the town’s old railway station, will take a look back at the town over the years.The museum, which opened in 1998, also houses the town’s archives which often prove usefeul to residents.Henrike Bird, the curator of the museum, said: “It’s an archive for Insch and it also houses a changing exhibition every year.“Many people in the town use the archives when they buy a new house in the area or something.“This year’s exhibition is all about Insch, but we have had many different types of exhibitions, like last year we looked into the police forces of the north-east.“But this year, because of our anniversary, we thought it would be best to stay local.”The museum aims to show the ways that the town has changed in the past two decades, with one of the pieces featuring a series of old and new photographs.Henrike said: “We sent the photographer around the town, and asked him to take the same photos that were taken 20 years ago.“It’s really quite surprising, because we could really see how much the town has changed.”The museum is run by volunteers, meaning that the times it can be opened are limited.It was built inside a derelict building that was supposed to be torn down in 1996 before being spared by Aberdeenshire Council.Henrike said: “Thankfully Aberdeenshire Council saved it. One of the conditions of it being saved was to put a heritage centre in it, and that’s what we are.“We’re very proud that we’ve been here for 20 years and it’s getting better and better.”To celebrate the anniversary, the museum will be holding an open day on September 22, following a successful trial earlier this year.Henrike said: “The first one was a complete trial, we just opened the doors in May, and so many people came in.

Purple had long been the preserve of royals and the elite of society because it was so difficult and expensive to produce.“I’ve been able to develop a method which I believe is more similar to the original.This shows that Perkin was well ahead of his time and that although his discovery was accidental, he understood enough about the chemical process to avoid giving away his secrets to competitors.”Dr Plater said he does not believe Perkin ever fully documented the infamous method he stumbled across to create mauveine.He added: “My research suggests that the samples given to the museums are true to the method used to manufacture the mauveine commercially, but are not the same as the mauveine made by his patented method.“This theory is backed up by the samples obtained from the six pence stamps and evidence from a famous lecture Perkin gave in 1896 where he expressed his concerns about competition.“It seems to me that he never fully revealed what he did to scale up the production of his famous dye.”Dr Plater explains the motivation for this could be related to the difference between the yields produced by the two different processes.He said: “Mauveine is a very difficult thing to make because the yield is very low.“The yields I have been able to reproduce in a lab give around 5% rather than the 1% from his patented method of 1856.“On this basis it is clear to see why a more efficient method was needed for mass manufacturing.“I propose that he used a very early traceless synthesis to modify the composition and improve the yield.“This shows that far from the accidental chemist, he really was a true pioneer of his time.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b7bc0562e975-848x564.jpg ","title":"station opening fit for a queen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Royal train station has been restored to its former glory – three years after it was destroyed by a blaze.Ballater Royal Station was devastated by fire following an electrical fault in 2015. Aberdeenshire Council pledged to rebuild the station using old plans and photographs as guides.The station was finally opened by Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson who cut the ribbon on the project yesterday.He said: “I think it sends out a real signal because people have had a really rough time with the storm and the fire.“This is an iconic part of the community, reaching right back into history, but we’re bringing it up to the modern day.“A vast amount of work has been done to take it forward, to reflect the old station and what it meant to the community.“I think this will be very much welcomed by the local community.“This is a valuable community asset, and the council wanted to commit to making sure that an iconic building, and part of our history, was brought back to life for wide public enjoyment.”The station was converted to include the royal waiting room in 1886, under the express instructions of Queen Victoria.The royal family would make regular trips through Ballater on their way to nearby Balmoral Castle. The final journey for the royals through the village took place in 1965.Continuing the royal connection, a restaurant inside the station, The Carriage, was opened by the Prince’s Foundation.The charity was set up by Prince Charles, the Duke of Rothesay, to create “harmonious communities”.Robert Lovie, the deputy executive director of the Prince’s Foundation, said the station has been given the “royal seal of approval”.“The challenge was to create a feel inside like people were actually on the platform of a working station,” he said.“The duke has been kept involved throughout the process.“He can actually remember arriving at Ballater as a child on his holidays, so he has great memories of that.“He felt that it had to be done absolutely right and give the people of Royal Deeside back what they’d lost.“I think that he is very happy with how it has turned out.”Businesses are hopeful that the station, which will also include a VisitScotland tourist information hub and the newly relocated Ballater Library, will help to increase tourism.Erek Skene, the part owner of Dee Valley Confectioners, also located in Station Square, said: “Hopefully it will bring more people up to this area of the village.“It’s good for us here and for the whole village. Hopefully we’ll get a boost.”Alan Yule, the owner of A.B. Yule newsagents in the village, said: “It’s lovely, I hope it brings people to us.“It’s been a construction site for three years, so it’s been a bit of a mess, but it’s looking very lovely.”Jo Robinson, the north-east regional director for VisitScotland, said: “This centre represents one of 26 across Scotland and it allows people to come and get some information and inspiration about what to do in the area.“The centre is a real hub, they work with tourism-based businesses in the local area, so they’ll tell the centre what they’ve got going on.”Councillor Geva Blackett, who represents Ballater, said: “It’s the heart of Ballater which really makes it the heart of Deeside.“This is where visitors will come to gather information about what they can do. We’ve got an amazing library which will now be open more.“Hopefully the visitor centre will encourage people to visit the other shops and other parts of the village more.”To ensure the accuracy of the station, a conservation architect was hired, who combed through historical documents, plans and photographs to help recreate the station as it once was.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dees forbes relishes locos test","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBanks o’ Dee co-manager Tommy Forbes is looking forward to the challenge of taking on Highland League Inverurie Locos.Dee meet the Railwaymen at Harlaw Park tonight in the first round of the Evening Express Aberdeenshire Cup.The tie was originally scheduled for August 1, but clashed with Locos’ involvement in the Irn-Bru Cup play-off round.Forbes said: “It’s still early in the season.

As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mayds talent puts on a captivating performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 09/08/18, 1:35 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe children of the Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) put on a theatrical performance of The Magic Brocade for the delight of an audience of parents.The Chinese folk tale was performed in the MAYDS hall by the Monday drama club, bringing fairies and spells to Lochgilphead.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"donalds drive to solway trophy inspired by gran","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/08/18, 11:43 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSome of Argyll\u0026#8217s rally crews travelled to the Solway Coast near Dumfries for the next round of the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship (STRC) on Saturday August 4.Again the crews were blessed with decent weather at the Dundrennan training camp for the eight stages.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe.

Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO). It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7 (under 12s and over 65s \u0026pound5) are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"a68-reopens-to-traffic-after-serious-injury-collision-in-northumberland","story":"THE A68\u0026nbspsouth of the Carter Bar has reopened to traffic following a \u0027serious injury collision\u0027 earlier\u0026nbspthis morning.\nEmergency services were called to the A68 just north of Rochester in Northumberland\u0026nbspbefore 7.30am after a report of a crash between a car and a HGV.\nThe incident closed the road in both directions between Scotland and England for nearly nine hours.\nNorthumbria Police have thanked\u0026nbspdrivers\u0026nbspfor their\u0026nbsppatience and understanding.\nThe A68 at Rochester in Northumberland has been reopened following the earlier collision.

Scottish Borders Council calling for a rethink of its benefits assistance service.\nIn November 2017 the council merged the customer, homelessness, and welfare benefits services to become one integrated department.\nNow, a petition signed by over 200 Borders residents has been handed into Scottish Borders Council, urging the authority to employ officers with a specific remit to assist benefits claimants in applying for welfare. \u0026nbsp\nThe petition further calls on the council to \u0026ldquoensure there are sufficient staff resources within Scottish Borders Council for maximisation of benefit entitlement in the Borders and to \u0026ldquoacknowledge the error made in not carrying out any public consultation on the restructure.\nThe author of the petition and chair of the Borders mental health forum, Jenny Mushlin, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very concerned that at a time when the benefits system has become so complicated the council has changed its service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors of what people are facing at the moment, and hopefully persuade them to hire more people in the future to help people with filling in of forms and other admin.\n\u0026ldquoThe welfare benefits service was a much loved service which really helped people and the changes were made with no consultation whatsoever.\n\u0026ldquoWe are calling for them to consult with people who claim welfare benefits as to what is needed.\nCouncillors sitting on the Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos audit and scrutiny committee will hear representations from the petition\u0026rsquos authors and from council officers on Thursday, before making a decision on whether to accept or reject the petition.\nAhead of the meeting, Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos service director for customers and communities has written to councillors urging them to take no further action.\nIn her statement, she said: \u0026ldquoThe aim of the restructure was to ensure that the level of service provided continued and in some areas improved, ensuring Scottish Borders Council was prepared for ongoing welfare reform including the rollout of universal credit.\n\u0026ldquoThe Department for Work and Pensions expectation on customers to self-serve online has created increased demands on Council services to assist customers.\n\u0026ldquoPrior to November 2017 the equivalent of 1.7 welfare benefit assistants were employed to assist with basic benefit enquiries including form filling with customers.\n\u0026ldquoWe now have 49 customer advice and support advisors across a wider range of locations, with a remit to assist customers at the first point of contact with their enquiry whether they present in a locality office face to face, over the telephone or online.\n\u0026ldquoThese advisers already deal with a range of benefit enquiries and applications as well as carrying out assessments for blue badges.\n\u0026ldquoThe aim is to provide a holistic service where a customer can speak to the same member of

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":null,"title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial. Its \u0026lsquolife expectancy\u0026rsquo is approximately 50 years."},{"url":null,"title":"famous-old-east-lothian-football-club-revived","story":"  The newly revived Wallyford Bluebell football team has already won the John Whyte Memorial Trophy, awarded to the champions of the five-a-side tournament hosted by Musselburgh Athletic Football Club at Olive Bank during the Musselburgh Festival.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.

Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council (NBCC) contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

The new document states that healthcare workers, such as GPs, practice nurses and sexual health consultants, should support people diagnosed with an STI to notify their partners.  \u0026ldquoPartner notification may be undertaken by the healthcare professional or the person diagnosed with an STI, the document states.          Remember that by wearing a condom you\u0027re not only protecting yourself, but protecting your partner too. Some STI\u0027s have no signs or symptoms.

Services should ensure that they are prepared to talk to people about \u0026ldquopartner notification and to support people to inform their sexual partners, Nice said.  In 2017, there were 422,147 diagnoses of STIs made in England, it added.  The new quality standard, which has been put out to consultation, aims to improve the care for people accessing sexual health services.  It also states that patients should be seen within 48 hours of requesting an appointment, to reduce the likelihood of them passing on infections and to reduce complications of illness.  A Nice spokesman said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos important that partners of people diagnosed with an STI have the opportunity to be tested themselves and if necessary treated, in order to prevent the spread of infections and to reduce their risk of developing health complications.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why our draft standard supports best practice in current sexual health services, that help and support should be provided to people who might otherwise find it difficult to tell their partners about their STI.  Welcoming the new standard,\u0026nbspDr Diana Mansour, vice president for clinical quality for\u0026nbspthe Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH), said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoOne of the recommendations of the draft standard is that people diagnosed with an STI are encouraged to notify their partners.  \u0026ldquoFSRH strongly supports this recommendation so that STI morbidity is reduced in the community.  \u0026ldquoFor healthcare professionals, this means supporting people to contact their own partners or to directly contact, test and treat partners of those with an STI without revealing the patient\u0026rsquos identity.  \u0026ldquoPartner notification can make patients feel uncomfortable. It might pose a strain in relationships new and old or cause embarrassment with more casual partners.  \u0026ldquoHowever, STIs can pose serious health consequences both to the patient and their partners such as infertility and pelvic inflammatory disease.  \u0026ldquoSTI rates are on the rise, with a 20% increase in syphilis cases in 2017 compared to 2016, so we encourage people to visit their local sexual and reproductive health clinic and be tested."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8449064.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"activists-urge-catholic-church-to-change-tack-on-lgbt-issues","story":"  Launching the Equal Future campaign in Dublin to coincide with the beginning of the World Meeting of Families (WMOF), campaigner Tiernan\u0026nbspBrady said he wants to highlight the damage being done to children and young people.  The campaign is the largest global initiative of LGBT groups, including 60 countries worldwide.  Mr Brady said there is a \u0026ldquoclear message that members of the LGBT community were not welcome at the WMOF event in Dublin.  \u0026ldquoWe want to highlight the damage that is being done to children and young people as they grow up thinking that to be LGBT would be wrong,\u0026nbspa disappointment or just bad luck but none of those are true, he said.  \u0026ldquoThe sad truth is there is a clear message they are not welcome at the World Meeting of Families.  \u0026ldquoLGBT looked to have stands and they were\u0026nbspdenied.  \u0026ldquoImages of same-sex families were removed from all the material and I can\u0026rsquot think of a clearer message to show LGBT people you are not part  of this and you are not wanted in here.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos not what Catholic people feel and it\u0026rsquos about time the upper management caught up with this.  \u0026ldquoNo child should ever grow up feeling they are less than others if they are or were to discern they are LGBT.  The founder and director of the Equality Campaign said he wants to raise awareness of the damage done to young people when the Synod of Bishops takes place at the Vatican in October.  Mr Brady added: \u0026ldquoThe Synod on Young People is a once-in-a-generation moment for us to shine a light on the role stigma against LGBT in its\u0026nbspvarious forms affects the mental health of children and young people, and has for too long been overlooked.  \u0026ldquoIt is important for the Church to look at this as part of their stated desire to consider situations where young people face exclusion for\u0026nbspsocial or religious reasons.  \u0026ldquoEqual Future 2018 is calling on the Synod on Young People to consider the damage done as a consequence of the Church\u0026rsquos teachings and reconsider its teachings on LGBT, Mr Brady said.

One of the contributors, Eros Shaw, was raised in a traditional Catholic family in China.  \u0026ldquoAs my sexual orientation became more and more apparent, stress from studies and uncertainties about the future also became more intensive, as did my feelings of guilt towards my parents, he said.  \u0026ldquoBut it did not stop my feelings from growing.  \u0026ldquoFrom one day to the next, I struggled in agony.  \u0026ldquoLater I participated the events of China Catholic Rainbow community.  \u0026ldquoIn there I met a great priest friend to be my spiritual director and\u0026nbspfriends who are seem with my case.  \u0026ldquoI feel that I am free from the burden.  \u0026ldquoIt is not my fault that I am gay, I am also beloved by God.

In 2013 LGBT+ Catholics joined the main congregation of Farm Street Church in Mayfair for evening mass.  Since then they contributed to every aspect of liturgical, spiritual and pastoral life of the church.  LGBT+ community member Nick O\u0026rsquoShea said he had been unsure of how to reconcile his beliefs and his sexuality before finding Farm Street.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom from London and the key thing about London is that it\u0026rsquos almost easier to be gay than be a Catholic, he said.  \u0026ldquoI was lacking a framework for being gay and Catholic and how was I going to live a life that would be pleasing to God.

Fr Dominic Robinson said the aim was to create a safe environment for everybody.  \u0026ldquoThis was part of the whole process of what we call opening our doors, Fr Robinson said.

Le Roy discovered Weah playing for a club in Cameroon in the late 1980s and recommended him to Wenger, the then coach of Monaco in France.  Wenger took the advice, signed the Liberian who went on to play for Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan, and became the first \u0026ndash and still only \u0026ndash African to win the Fifa world player of the year award in 1995.  Liberian sports minister D. Zeogar Wilson said Wenger will be given the Humane Order of African Redemption with the rank of Knight Grand Commander.  Wenger and Le Roy, the current Togo coach, are both expected to attend Friday\u0026rsquos ceremony, government officials said.  But Darius Dillon, an opposition politician, criticised Weah for using the nation\u0026rsquos highest honour and the office of the president to recognise people who only played a role in his \u0026ldquopersonal life.  \u0026ldquoThe nation\u0026rsquos highest honour cannot be given to somebody who has not done something directly for the country, Mr Dillion said.  Other political opponents have questioned the decision with Emmanuel Gonquoi, of the Economic Freedom Fighters of Liberia, calling it \u0026ldquoa complete waste of time.  Weah is Liberia\u0026rsquos best sportsman ever and the golden years of his career coincided with civil war in Liberia.  Mr Wilson, the sports minister, said he disagreed with the criticism.  \u0026ldquoDuring the heat of the civil war the only good thing that came out of Liberia was George Weah and his soccer prowess, he said.  \u0026ldquoHow can we not honour these guys who made him get where he got?  Weah dedicated his award to Wenger when he was named world player of the year and has said the former Arsenal coach was the most important influence on his career.  He invited Wenger to his inauguration as president in January, although Wenger could not attend.  Wenger has also praised Weah.  \u0026ldquoThe life of this guy is a real film, Wenger said earlier this year. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos unbelievable. It can make a fantastic film.  The 51-year-old retired from football in 2003 and turned almost immediately to politics, failing in his first attempt to become president of Liberia in 2005.  His victory by a landslide in last year\u0026rsquos election highlighted his inspiring story \u0026mdash he was born in a slum surrounded by swamps on the outskirts of the Liberian capital Monrovia and overcame early hardship to become an international soccer star and then president of his country."},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn-calls-for-bold-thinking-on-future-of-media","story":"              Jeremy Corbyn will propose a shake-up of the way the TV licence fee is paid and set as he outlines a raft of suggestions for the BBC and wider media in a speech to the industry.The Labour leader will argue that the licence fee should be modernised for the digital age, with a \u0026ldquofairer and more effective way found to fund the BBC.He will float the idea of introducing a digital licence fee \u0026ndash paid by tech giants or through internet service providers \u0026ndash to supplement the current licence fee, with a view to reducing the cost\u0026nbspfor poorer households and helping the corporation to compete \u0026ldquomore effectively.Mr Corbyn will also propose the creation of a new independent body to set the licence fee and suggest the BBC should be placed on a permanent statutory footing \u0026ldquoto end government control through charter renewal. The Labour leader will air the ideas when he gives the Alternative MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival on Thursday, the fourth day of his visit to Scotland.Mr Corbyn is expected to outline his support for the BBC as a publicly\u0026nbspowned, public service broadcaster, but argue it needs to become more free from government influence, more accountable to the public and more representative of the country.Among his suggestions, he will argue for \u0026ldquocomplete transparency over the diversity of the corporation\u0026rsquos workforce with the publication of data including social class, and he will call for the election of some of the BBC board members by staff and licence fee payers.On the licence fee, he will tell the festival: \u0026ldquoIf we want an independent BBC, we should consider setting it free by placing it on a permanent statutory footing, with a new independent body setting the licence fee.\u0026ldquoThe licence fee itself is another potential area for modernisation. In the digital age, we should consider whether a digital licence fee could be a fairer and more effective way to fund the BBC.\u0026ldquoA digital licence fee, supplementing the existing licence fee,\u0026nbspcollected from tech giants and internet service providers, who extract huge wealth from our shared digital space,\u0026nbspcould allow a democratised and more plural BBC to compete far more effectively with the private multinational digital giants like Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook.\u0026ldquoThis\u0026nbspcould also\u0026nbsphelp reduce the cost of the licence\u0026nbspfee for poorer households.In a wide-ranging speech on the media as a whole, Mr Corbyn will argue that there is a need for \u0026ldquobold, radical thinking on the future of our media because of \u0026ldquolow levels of public trust and the impact of the digital age.Without major changes, a \u0026ldquofew tech giants and unaccountable billionaires will control huge swathes of our public space and debate, he is expected to say.Mr Corbyn, who once worked on the Newport and Market Drayton Advertiser, will also set out a number of proposals aimed at empowering public interest journalism.These include strengthening Freedom of Information (FOI) rules by ending ministerial vetoes and including private companies delivering public services under the FOI umbrella.Mr Corbyn will say it is unacceptable for corporate executives to \u0026ldquohide behind the excuse of commercial confidentiality when they are providing a public service.\u0026ldquoBut I think we should be more ambitious, he will tell the audience.\u0026ldquoCurrently, ministers can veto FOI releases. On two occasions, this veto has been used to block information about the UK\u0026rsquos decision to pursue military action against Iraq. That can\u0026rsquot be right.

The intervention comes as the Government prepares to publish papers outlining its planning for a possible no-deal Brexit.  Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is due to give a speech on Thursday to coincide with the release of the first of a raft of papers on more than 80 subjects.  It follows his assurances that EU citizens living in the UK will not be \u0026ldquoturfed out if no deal is agreed with Brussels, as he vowed to \u0026ldquomove swiftly to safeguard their future.  Mr Raab said he is confident of reaching an agreement, but sought to reassure those living in Britain that ministers would act quickly to secure their position if the UK crashes out of the EU.  The Cabinet minister told the BBC: \u0026ldquoWe hugely value the contribution of EU citizens here in the UK and I am confident that in the unlikely eventuality that we don\u0026rsquot have a deal, we will move swiftly to secure their position.  He said it is \u0026ldquoinconceivable we would do anything other than make sure that they are legally in a position where they\u0026rsquore secure to stay.

The tests are supposed to help teachers assess the academic levels pupils have achieved when they first come to school.  They are then used to judge progress throughout their school career with further testing in P4, P7 and S3.  However, critics argue testing five-year-olds is meaningless because levels of maturity are so different.  There have also been concerns that pupils have found the assessments stressful - partly in cases where whole classes have sat the tests against government guidance.  Joanna Murphy, chair of the National Parent Forum of Scotland (NPFS), praised the information from the assessments.  In a letter to The Herald she said: \u0026ldquoI have seen sample results ... and the information available to teachers is exceptional.  \u0026ldquoIt provides details of a child\u0026rsquos specific skills, knowledge and understanding, which enhances the teacher\u0026rsquos judgement.  However, Ms Murphy said a full understanding of the roll-out and purpose of the assessments had never been passed on to parents.  The NPFS previously suggested that letters should be sent to all P1 parents to ensure they fully understood the Scottish National Standardised Assessments.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey [Scottish Government] believed it would result in unnecessary profile raising, but as we made clear, and we are now seeing, when there is a vacuum of information it allows for fear and anxiety to spread.  \u0026ldquoWhat is of most concern is that parents are not getting the clear, balanced information they need to be able to decide whether assessment is right for their child.  \u0026ldquoThis issue is wider than the standardised assessments, it is about a repeated lack of good direct communication from schools, local authorities and Scottish Government to parents.  Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, accused the government of \u0026ldquodeliberately confusing parents over their right to withdraw children from national testing.  Advice on whether pupils can opt out has been conflicting with some internal documents suggesting the test are not compulsory.  The most recent government statement says there is no formal legal right to withdraw - because the tests themselves are not statutory - but suggests parent should talk to their school if they want to opt out.  John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, welcomed the view that standardised assessments could provide \u0026ldquoexceptional information.  He added: \u0026ldquoParent organisations worked with the Scottish Government to co-produce information leaflets for parents, carers and teachers about the standardised assessments which were sent to all schools last summer.  \u0026ldquoWe expect schools to communicate effectively with parents, and parents can talk to their child\u0026rsquos school at any time.  \u0026ldquoFollowing a review of the first year of assessments, we will shortly set out changes and enhancements to the system for this year, including enhanced communication with parents.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country. However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"first-womens-football-game-in-europe-was-played-in-carstairs","story":"  A minister\u0027s objection to women joining in a kickabout on a Sunday in Carstairs, Lanarkshire, in 1628, saw players branded \u0027insolent\u0027.  The Rev John Lindsay condemned women and men playing football on the Sabbath as it was expected to be a religious day devoted to solemn reflection and worship.  A church document dated August 21, 1628, revealed: \"Mr John Lindsay, minister at Carstairs, having regretted the break of the Sabbath by the insolent behaviour of men and women in footballing, dancing and Barley Breaks, ordains every Brother (Minister) to labour to restrain the foresaid insolence and break of Sabbath, and to that effect to make intimation thereof into their several kirks next Sabbath day.\"  Experts believe the venue for the match was Carstairs\u0027 village green where the village\u0027s church originally stood.  The find has been hailed by politicians and academics on the 390th anniversary of the letter being penned.  Aileen Campbell,\u0026nbspMSP for Clydesdale, said: \"As Clydesdale\u0026rsquos MSP, I am thrilled that Carstairs in my constituency is the location of the first recorded women\u0026rsquos football game in Europe.  \"It is therefore fitting to be welcoming the game \u0027home\u0027 as we promote women\u0026rsquos football and encourage women and girls to take up sport.  \"As a football fan, I am delighted to see women\u0026rsquos football continue to grow and develop.

Vivienne MacLaren, of Scottish Women\u0026rsquos Football, said: \"Scotland has a proud history within the women\u0026rsquos game and we are delighted to acknowledge that women\u0026rsquos football has been present in Scotland for 390 years, far longer than most people would imagine.  \"As custodians of women\u0026rsquos football in Scotland we also welcome the launch of the first seminar to be held to share ideas and develop the game in Scotland.\"  Britain\u0027s first recorded international women\u0027s football match was played in Edinburgh in May 1881.

It followed an apparently innocuous reference to Scotland\u0026rsquos role in the hunt for the elusive Higgs Boson, or \u0026ldquoGod particle, named after the Edinburgh-based physicist Sir Peter Higgs.  The phrase was dropped after a blistering report from a Brighton-based firm of media consultants, which was published yesterday on the Scottish Government website.  There was also brutal criticism of a boast in the draft campaign that Scotland had produced arguably the best James Bond in Sir Sean Connery.  That was dismissed as \u0026ldquoobtuse and \u0026ldquofacile when compared to another boast about Scotland helping to develop the world\u0026rsquos first cancer vaccine.  \u0026ldquoHow is that an achievement? was the summary of the \u0026ldquobest 007 claim.  Ministers were also told images of children could deter potential visitors.  A list of \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquots included \u0026ldquochildren put people off (avoid on holiday), and while a shot of a castle was considered essential, the advice declared \u0026ldquochildren can be a negative.

The 110-page \u0026ldquoinsight findings were released under Freedom of Information law.  Produced by Lucid People (UK) Ltd, they gave feedback and advice on an early version of the promotional campaign now being aimed at in North America, London and China.  A joint project by ministers, VisitScotland, Universities Scotland and Scottish Development International, the aim was to show Scotland as a great place to visit, study, work and invest.  The original plan was also to \u0026ldquokick-start an advocacy-driven movement that would lead people round the world to view Scotland \u0026ldquoas a great brand.  However the media consultants said large parts of the draft campaign, which initially considered using the slogan \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos Calling or \u0026ldquoGo Scotland, were a duds.  Messages aimed at visitors were the most successful, followed by those for businesses.  But the research found many people were left \u0026ldquoconfused, disengaged and/or irritated by efforts to build a Scottish \u0026ldquobrand, including a film featuring Austin Powers star Mike Myers.  Out of character, Mr Myers was \u0026ldquonot recognised by many of those on whom the material was tested, and the film left people struggling to understand it, \u0026ldquoeven after explanation.  The \u0026lsquobrand\u0026rsquo material was \u0026ldquounclear, \u0026ldquoself-congratulatory and too focused on the past.

The report also revealed some of the image problems facing Scotland.  Among the starting perceptions in the US were \u0026ldquocastles and fog and \u0026ldquonothing to do.

The area this year has often been and packed with people, both audiences and people trying to walk, and yesterday at the Annual General Meeting of the Fringe Society, concern was raised about the conditions of the space during the festival.  The chief executive of the Fringe, Shona McCarthy, said the Mound, a man-made hill that connects the Old and the New Towns, surmounted by the Scottish National Gallery and the RSA building, would be the next public space to be revamped after significant changes were made to the Royal Mile artist performance this year.  However, how the changes will be implemented will depend on the major revamp to the National Gallery, which the National Galleries of Scotland are currently planning.  She said: \"This year we have completely reviewed the High Street, and how it looks...and I think the new stages, the accessibility platforms have been really well received.  \"I agree there is still work to be done on The Mound, and next year that will be a priority for us.  \"We need to reconsider how we manage the street performers on the Mound, there are bottlenecks, there are places that could work better for us.\"  A street performer at the AGM, Silver, said that the space was now cramped and \"a disaster\".  He blamed the National Galleries of Scotland for, several years ago, erecting railings outside the gallery buildings, reducing the amount of room, including steps, for the public to gather on.  \"Picture families sitting on those steps,\" he said.  The area at the bottom of the Playfair Steps, lined on one side by stalls, is often extremely difficult to navigate, he added.  He added: \"Think about this fence, it has destroyed the area, if you want to make it better, get rid of that.\"  A spokeswoman for the Fringe said that the changes did not mean the removal of street performers, but a performance and facility revamp similar to the one experienced on the Royal Mile.  There has been much debate this summer about the use of public space in Edinburgh during the festival.  The erection of black boards on Princes Street to shield the view of the Summer Sessions gigs in Princes Street Gardens led to controversy and their partial removal.  Oliver Davies, head of marketing at the Fringe, added: \"We\u0027ve done a lot of work on the High Street this year, one of the reasons we did not extend that to the Mound is that the National Galleries of Scotland have a long standing application to redevelop their footprint on the Mound.  \"We felt it was right to hold off, and we are still not sure what that impact might be, it will affect that space to some extent.\"  A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said that the railings outside the National Gallery, while not always present, were part of its listed status.  The detail of the new revamp of the gallery will be revealed in the near future, he noted."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-to-welcome-delegates-to-international-culture-summit","story":"  The fourth Edinburgh International Culture Summit will run from Wednesday to Friday at the Scottish Parliament.

The UK deficit was 1.9 per cent of GDP in the same year.  Public spending in Scotland was a record \u0026pound1576 higher per head than in the rest of the UK thanks to a cross-border subsidy from the Treasury.  The Scottish Tories said the \u0026lsquoblack hole\u0026rsquo in the nation\u0026rsquos finances showed why the SNP should drop any plans for another independence referendum.  The GERS figures showed Scotland\u0026rsquos finances would have been in an even worse state than previously thought in the first year of independence had there been a Yes vote in 2014.  Last year, GERS said the deficit had been \u0026pound13.3bn, or 8.3 per cent of GDP, in 2016/17.  However these have now been revised to \u0026pound14.5bn and 8.9 per cent of GDP.  The White Paper on independence launched by Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond forecast a manageable deficit of between \u0026pound2.7bn to \u0026pound5.5bn, or 1.6 to 3.2 per cent of GDP.  The difference was due to the oil price slump after the 2014 referendum.  The GERS figures also showed a record \u0026lsquoUnion dividend\u0026rsquo of \u0026pound1982 in 2016/17 after revisions compared to \u0026pound1882 in 2017/18 and \u0026pound952 in 2013/14.  This is the difference between how much Scotland contributed per head to the Exchequer and received back in public spending.  In 2017/18, Scotland\u0026rsquos per capita tax revenue was \u0026pound306 lower than the UK level and spending was \u0026pound1576 higher.  Just seven years ago, Scotland was a net contributor to the Treasury, at \u0026pound200 per head.  The new data did however show a marked upturn in Scotland\u0026rsquos geographical share of revenue from the North Sea, which was up from \u0026pound266m in 2016/17 to \u0026pound1.3bn.  Overall, Scotland generated 8 per cent of UK revenue last year, had 9.3 per cent of public spending, and accounted for 34 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos \u0026pound39.3bn deficit.  Ms Sturgeon said the figures showed the Scottish economy was in a \u0026ldquostate of recovery, but Brexit remained a \u0026ldquoreal and present danger.  She highlighted growth in the onshore economy in Scotland had been faster than in the UK.  The SNP\u0026rsquos recent Growth Commission, its revised economic blueprint for independence, envisaged a year one deficit of around 8.3 per cent, more than in 2017/18.  \u0026ldquoThat would suggest the trajectory in more positive in reality than the Growth Commission assumed, Ms Sturgeon said.  To the dismay of many on the left of the independence movement, the Commission proposed keeping a tight rein on public spending to halve the deficit over 10 years.  Ms Sturgeon said cutting the deficit was important, but not if it meant austerity.  She said: \u0026ldquoFiscal rules should not become counter-productive. So if actually what the economy needs is stimulus to get the economy growing faster, that\u0026rsquos what should take priority. The Growth Commission was an explicit rejection of the kind of austerity economics we have seen in recent years.  She said the 3 per cent deficit target in the Commission was \u0026ldquoa reasonable one, but added it was important not to become \u0026ldquoso fixated on that that it becomes counterproductive.  Asked if the \u0026pound1576 extra public spending per head would look fair to voters south of the border, she said it was \u0026ldquomore than fair given the history of North Sea oil receipts.  Ms Sturgeon refused to apologise for the even wider gap between the official figures for the putative first year of independence and those in the White Paper.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would defy anybody to say that they foresaw what happened in the North Sea and oil revenues. That\u0026rsquos what changed the projections.  \u0026ldquoWhat we see here today is an improving position, as oil improves and as our onshore [economy] improves. Don\u0026rsquot lose sight of the fact that onshore revenues excluding oil and gas are up by \u0026pound2bn. That is faster growth in onshore revenues than UK growth in onshore revenues in the same year.  \u0026ldquoWe have a Scottish economy that has had a difficult time in the last few years because of the position in oil. Notwithstanding that we have had strong onshore growth and we see that picture continuing here.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay added: \"The latest economic data points to an improving picture in Scotland. Our economy grew twice as fast as the UK in the most recent quarter, while unemployment remains close to its record low and confidence is returning to the oil and gas sector.  \"Overall revenue in Scotland reaching \u0026pound60bn for the first time ever, underlining the fact that we have a productive and growing economy, despite the UK Government\u0027s London centric economic policies.  \"Meanwhile, Scottish exports of goods have increased by 12 per cent over the past year - the fastest rate of growth of any nation in the UK - with huge potential for further expansion in key overseas markets.\"  Scottish Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: \u0026ldquoIf Nicola Sturgeon wants to continue her threat of second referendum, she has to explain where she would find \u0026pound13bn to fill this deficit.  \u0026ldquoAssuming that can\u0026rsquot be done, the prospect of another divisive and unwelcome vote must be removed for good so Scotland can focus on what really matters.  \u0026ldquoYet again, the union dividend has been made clear.  \u0026ldquoBy being part of the UK, Scotland received an extra \u0026pound1576 for every man, woman and child last year above the UK average. For a family of four, that\u0026rsquos more than \u0026pound6000 in additional public spending.  \u0026ldquoIf Scotland was to be ripped out the UK, this spending would be slashed drastically, meaning schools, hospitals and infrastructure would be hit.  \u0026ldquoAny Scottish Government would also have to massively increase taxes and borrowing to help make up the difference, something the hardworking public simply wouldn\u0026rsquot accept.  \u0026ldquoAnd while Scotland\u0026rsquos finances improved slightly on the whole last year, the rest of the UK\u0026rsquos have done even better, meaning the gap is now bigger. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: \u0026ldquoPeople across Scotland are sick and tired of austerity \u0026ndash and these figures show that the SNP\u0026rsquos plans for independence would mean unprecedented levels of austerity for Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe SNP\u0026rsquos plan to close Scotland\u0026rsquos deficit is a cuts commission \u0026ndash a vision which protects the interests of big corporations and the privileged few instead of our vital public services.  \u0026ldquoThe dividing line in Scotland is now between Labour\u0026rsquos plan to invest and build an economy that works for the many, not the few, or further austerity with the SNP and the Tories.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: \u0026ldquoThese numbers are another cruel blow to the Nationalists, coming from their own government.  \u0026ldquoIt adds to the misery set out in the SNP\u0027s Growth Commission.  \u0026ldquoWhichever way you look at it, under nationalist plans all the good things we all want to do in Scotland would be under threat because of funding cuts. Investing in people through education and mental health would be harder under independence.  Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie added: \u0026ldquoHere we have another reminder that the Scottish economy is still too focussed on oil and gas extraction instead of making the needed transition to clean and sustainable renewable sources of energy.  \u0026ldquoWhile other parties use this annual publication as justification for how Scotland couldn\u0026rsquot be a small, successful independent country, or how great the SNP government thinks it is they\u0026rsquod do well to remember that both our prosperity and our climate depends on moving to a clean economy.

Mike Tholen of\u0026nbspOil \u0026amp Gas UK\u0026nbspsaid the GERS data showed a \"striking transformation\" of the UK oil and gas industry since the downturn.

She said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe true identity of the Guanche people\u0026nbsphas long remained a mystery \u0026ndash with the literary accounts of invading Spaniards being some of the only real information left about these intriguing indigenous people.  \u0026ldquoDuring this project, I ended up learning so much about the Guanche and I hope her image will inspire others to find out more about this ancient population.

Yet Ms Davidson has also given a strong signal that if she were not to succeed in this endeavour, then a switch to Westminster could be on the cards.  Last year in an interview with the Spectator magazine, the Scottish Tory leader noted how by the 2021 Scottish parliamentary election she would have led her party significantly longer than her predecessors and she would be open to \u0026ldquoother conversations.  Stressing how she had not ruled out a move to Westminster, Ms Davidson bolstered the view that this could be her intention when she noted: \u0026ldquoIf devolution is going to work, then, actually, there has to be the ability to move between chambers and parliaments.

Mr Johnson achieved a net score of -18, level-pegging with Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, and one point ahead of Mr Rees-Mogg. Jeremy Hunt, the new Foreign Secretary, came in with a net score of -34 while Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, trailed on -38.

The employment tribunal which heard the case has now issued its ruling that BrewDog unlawfully discriminated against Mr Ross and treated him unfavourably because of his condition.The company, which has been valued at £1.8bn were told to pay compensation to Mr Ross in the sum of £12,052.New legislation which passed into law in 2015 prevented the tribunal from ordering that BrewDog staff undergo further equality training.A spokesman for the company said: “This was a really difficult situation for every member of our team involved in it, and clearly for the Tribunal panel too as their decision on the outcome was split.                                                                                                         “We worked with James in order to find a suitable alternative role within the business where his safety would not be compromised, but James wanted to keep his packaging role. “We ended up in a position where we had to balance James’ wishes with the best interests of the team around him, and while we regret that an agreement couldn’t be reached, we have a moral responsibility to prioritise the safety of our team. “We wish James all the best in his new role and his upcoming studies.”RNIB Scotland, which supports blind and partially sighted people, said: “Many employers still assume this group would be difficult or even impossible to employ.                                                                                                        “We know of journalists, teachers, bankers and physicists working in Scotland with sight loss.“It’s about encouraging employers to consider what people can do, not what they can’t.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"housing development for inverurie site","story":"        A new  housing development may be about to get underway in Inverurie following a recommendation to grant planning approval for a new development by CALA Homes.

For not only will it commemorate the centenary of the end of World War One, but it will also mark the centenary of the restoration of Poland’s sovereignty as the Second Polish Republic from the German, Austrian and Russian Empires.                                       \t      \t\tLabour of love...for Keith Burns, project manager from MAPA Scotland, the charity founded to restore the Great Polish Map of Scotland in 2010. Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 10:38

agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Wednesday 22 Aug

NHS Highland recently approved the move to public consultation, which has been widely welcomed.The preferred option includes the development of a proposed care hub/village at the Dunbar Hospital site in Thurso and the Pulteney House care home site in Wick.The plans also include a multimillion-pound upgrade for Caithness General as part of an overall \u0026pound30 million investment for the area.The option of developing Wick\u0026rsquos Town and County Hospital will also be included in the consultation.The Wick event will be held on Monday, August 20, between 6pm and 7pm, while the Thurso one takes place the following evening at the same time.People planning to attend either should contact Christian Nicolson of NHS Highland on 07870513114 or email christian.nicolson@nhs.net to help ensure adequate seating can be provided.The health authority says further events will be arranged in due course and dates will be widely publicised.Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 10:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116965.jpg","title":"Wildlife cruise passengers get close up view of orca pod","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt happened on Sunday during a Pentland Venture wildlife cruise when five orcas, including two calves, came into view \u0026ndash to gasps of delight from onlookers.Fred Fermor of John O\u0026rsquoGroats Ferries said: \u0026ldquoAs luck would have it we had more than 100 passengers on our wildlife cruise that day.\u0026ldquoI was taking a walk round the stacks and witnessed the spectacle from the shore.\u0026ldquoIt was great to hear the excited chatter and shouts from the passengers when they saw the orcas approach the Pentland Venture which by that time was just bobbing around.He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a case of letting people see these magnificent creatures while respecting their space and habitat.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to think that Caithness can offer such experiences and that folk will go back to the far corners and tell their friends what a wonderful place we live in.The orcas were photographed from Duncansby Head by Colin Bird, former area group co-ordinator for Sea Watch Foundation, who started the annual Orca Watch at Duncansby.He said: \u0026ldquoThe ferry has been a great help in providing sightings of cetaceans in the Pentland Firth over the past 15 years.These sightings have helped form a greater understanding of the movement of orcas between Iceland and the north of Scotland.As reported in the Courier, local wildlife photographer Karen Munro saw seven killer whales on Friday close to the shore at St John\u0026rsquos Point, where they \u0026ldquoharassed seals for about an hour. They moved on towards Stroma and she alerted the ferry team.Mr Fermor said: \u0026ldquoThe orcas stayed at Stroma for a while and although some distance from John O\u0026rsquoGroats it caused a bit of a stir onshore and Karen generously let visitors view the whales through her powerful telescope.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers from all around the British Isles and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.This summer\u0026rsquos stable weather is one possible explanations for the high number of cetacean sightings in the country as a whole, with higher temperatures bringing warmer-water species and creating the conditions for plankton fronts to develop \u0026ndash attracting shoals of fish and, in turn, whales and dolphins.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 10:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August 22, 2018 at 1:30 pmAdvertorial: Develop your skills with our range of workshops.

No personal information will be gathered as part of this.Evidence suggests that across Scotland more than a quarter of people in education have struggled at some point in the previous year to access sanitary products with some girls and young women having missed school or skipped classes because they didn’t have access to products.The Scottish Government, local authorities and the university and college sectors have therefore committed to providing free access to sanitary products in all schools, colleges and universities in Scotland beginning from the new academic term.Further information can be found at  www.young.scot/periods.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm. The film has been programmed to coincide with #skyranMOON and the Museum Of The Moon at Stromness Academy.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Dr Phil Hammond said he had been assured he could continue to broadcast Saturday Surgery on Radio Bristol after announcing on television in July he had been endorsed by the National Health Action Party to contest North East Somerset.            But after again mentioning he had been chosen as a prospective parliamentary candidate against Mr Rees-Mogg in a tweet yesterday, the presenter said he was dismissed from the programme he has fronted for the past 12 years.            READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon rejects claims Scotland is ‘subsidised’ by UKThe NHS doctor, who is also Private Eye’s medical correspondent, said he was “very sad and a little puzzled” by the decision, which the BBC said was in keeping with its editorial guidelines.Dr Hammond, who lives in the constituency he plans to contest, said: “I strongly suspect whoever made this decision has never listened to any of my broadcasts.“Such a sudden decision smells strongly of fear.“There is no political bias on the Saturday Surgery, just three hours of health and happiness with some live music.”            In a statement on his website, the outspoken medic said the head of BBC Radio Bristol, Jess Rudkin, knew of his intention to stand.He said he was “advised that it should not be a problem, but that he would have to stand down during purdah” before any election.Dr Hammond said doctors were allowed to stand for Parliament or become priests as long as they did not bring their views to work. He said BBC presenters “should be trusted to broadcast without bias despite their declared political affiliations”.Mr Rees-Mogg was first elected in North East Somerset in 2010 and held onto the seat in 2017, with a majority of 10,235.            A BBC spokeswoman said: “Impartiality is at the heart of our journalism. Active political involvement is an area covered by our editorial guidelines.“Standing as a candidate in an election is a conflict of interest and someone seeking election is unable to continue in this type of editorial role.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4787945.1534935279!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon rejects claims scotland is subsidised by uk","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

A recent big poll of Scottish opinion showed our nation supports the demand for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal by a margin of 48 to 31 per cent.             And if we get that referendum, Scotland would vote to stay in the EU by an even bigger majority than we did before – 66 to 34 per cent.

In history, our leaders will be judged on their actions today, not their warm words, when it comes to the fight for a People’s Vote on the final deal.Two years on from the 2016 referendum, we find ourselves in a position where the promises made by those cheerleading the Brexit campaign are neither being met nor are likely to be, as the Government and its Brexiteer stalwarts desperately try to convince themselves that Brexit, as promised by the Leave campaign, can actually be implemented.We will end up paying a £50 billion-plus divorce settlement for a worse relationship with our EU partners than the one which we enjoy today.             We will enter a 21-month transition period from 30 March next year onwards, where not only will we have to implement all EU rules and laws but we will have no say over them.

Scotland recorded a \u0026#16313.4 billion gap between the amount spent on public services and taxes raised to pay for them, official figures today showed.                The annual deficit has fallen by more than £1 billion from last year and is also down as a share of the size of the country’s economy to 7.9 per cent, the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland figures today show.            The figures also show that Scots enjoyed a public spending levels of £1576 higher than the rest of the UK - while paying on average £306 less per head in tax. This is a record so-called “union dividend” in recent years.

But Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: “These Scottish Government figures show that at more than £13 billion, Scotland’s deficit at 7.9 per cent as a share of GDP is four times that of the UK’s 1.9 per cent as a whole. This is concerning.“However these figures also confirm that being part of a strong United Kingdom – the 5th largest economy in the world – is worth nearly £1,900 for every single person in Scotland, which supports vital public services. Simply put, Scotland contributed eight per cent of UK tax, and received more than nine per cent of UK spending for the benefit of families across the country.”Total spending across Scotland’s public sector was £73.4 billion in 2017/18 the figures show, while £60 billion was raised in taxes. Although the GERS figures are often portrayed as an indicator of how the nation’s finances might look under independence, most experts agree they only provide a snapshot of the current situation and how it would be on “Day 1” of independence.            The figures do show a marked improvement in oil revenues by more than £1 billion as the fortunes of the North Sea continue to bounce back thanks to an improving oil picture. Scotland’s illustrative share of North Sea revenue increased from £266 million in 2016-17 to £1.3 billion.Professor Graeme Roy of the respected Fraser of Allander think tanks said: “With both onshore revenues and expenditure rising, the relative improvement in Scotland’s fiscal position has largely been driven by a better outturn on North Sea Revenues. “Whilst revenues from Scotland’s share of the North Sea have increased, they remain much lower than in previous years. The Office for Budget Responsibility predict that North Sea revenues for the UK as a whole will remain around £1 billion for the foreseeable future.”READ MORE: Scots economy outstrips annual UK growth over the past yearThe 7.9 per cent deficit north of the border as a share of the country’s economy is four times the size of the rest of the UK, on 1.9%.

Scotland’s deficit is also in line with most regions of the the UK, Ms Sturgeon said,   insisting that the heavy concentration of economic activity in London and the South east makes this region the “outlier.”            But Labour leader Richard Leonard said: “These figures show that the real change Scotland needs isn’t to leave the UK – it’s a Labour government willing to end austerity and invest instead.“People across Scotland are sick and tired of austerity – and these figures show that the SNP’s plans for independence would mean unprecedented levels of austerity for Scotland.”Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the North Sea recovery was nothing to welcomeHe said: “Here we have another reminder that the Scottish economy is still too focussed on oil and gas extraction instead of making the needed transition to clean and sustainable renewable sources of energy.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the figures were a “cruel blow” to the SNP’s dream of independence.“Whichever way you look at it, under nationalist plans all the good things we all want to do in Scotland would be under threat because of funding cuts,” he said.“Investing in people through education and mental health would be harder under independence.” "},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency services to share hq ","story":"Ambulance and fire crews are set to move into new joint headquarters in Lerwick in the coming weeks.\nBosses from both services gave an update at a meeting of the community safety resilience board on Wednesday.\nIt will mean the ambulance service moving from the NHS-owned property at Burgh Road to the fire station at Sea Road.\nThe shift is to allow closer working between the services, to be more cost-effective, and allow the ambulance service to shift from its location which has been criticised because of access issues.\nChanges have been made to the Sea Road building layout internally and both teams are to be moved in at the site by the end October or early November.\nAt the meeting the fire service again explained its desire for a change in firefighters’ duties in future, which would see them responding to medical emergencies.\nScottish Fire and Rescue Service assistant chief officer David McGowan talked about “a transformation” of the fire service and asking firefighters to take on different roles.\nThat included things like dealing with cardiac arrests, “wider calls for medical assistance” as well as a prevention role too, speaking to people in the community.\nIn September two new state-of-the-art fire engines are to come into force in Bixter and Bressay.\nCrews at the stations are taking part in training to use the rapid response vehicles.\nCosting about £190,000 each, Shetland, along with Orkney and the Western Isles is among the first areas in the country to take delivery of the vehicles.\nThey include high-pressure lances branded “Coldcut”, which allow crews to inject a fire suppressant through the wall of a burning building to tackle flames, without having to enter.\nThe vehicles can carry a maximum of four firefighters but the service is hoping to operate them with three.\nA defibrillator will also to be installed in both units.\nNorthern and Western Isles area manager Iain Macleod also gave an update on retained fire crews in the isles.\nFetlar had seen an increase in applications with seven people coming forward.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"various apprenticeships ","story":" Radar Technician – SERCO – Unst\nApprenticeship vacancies are open to male and female applicants, candidates over age 25 will be considered for some vacancies.\nWages vary dependent on employer.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nWednesday 22 Aug 2018 10:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27433  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nWe all need to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadership and determination.\nLifelonganti-apartheid campaigner and veteran of the national liberation struggle inSouth Africa, Ronnie Kasrils was in Belfast and Derry recently to launch hisnew book ‘A Simple Man’.\nMartinMcAuley asked me to interview Ronnie for a Sinn Féinvideo.\nMy lastquestion was to ask what continues to inspire him and his vision for thefuture.\nHeexplained how much today’s youth inspire him, and in particular young AhedTamimi from the occupied territories in Palestine.\nLastSunday Ahed was released from prison.\n\nI mether daddy in Ramallah three months ago.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

I spent 15 great years working in the MAC.\n  \n“It was like a second home for me and Gerry and Margaret treated me like a second son when they lived there. \n  \n“I made many great friends, who I don’t get to see often enough now, but I won’t forget. \n  \n“Many a busy night working and quite a few just drinking. Always plenty of craic and always loads of banter. \n  \n“So many great memories from a big part of my life. Sorry to see you close.”\n  \nBallymena United Allstars Ladies Football Club also reacted to the statement: “We’re very sorry to hear this. \n  \n“Thanks for everything you’ve helped us with over the years - the MAC will be much missed. Best wishes to all the staff. A sad day.”\n  \nOther posters also weighed in: “Charlie Havelin and his team have run The Michelin club amazingly for all these years. \n  \n“You will all be sorely missed. \n  \n“I looked at you all as great neighbours. Best of Luck for the Future.”\n  \nAnother said: “So sad to hear this, a club used by a large part of the local community and people farther afield. \n  \n“Good luck to all the staff who work there, wishing you all the very best in what you all do in the future.”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

And it’s an ideal venue to host birthday parties and school or group outings.”\n\nAir-tastic currently has two trampoline parks, located in Bangor and Cork, with a number of other Air-tastic trampoline parks planned to open in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in due course. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor further information on Air-tastic and the Craigavon trampoline park opening visit www.air-tastic or search Air-tastic Craigavon on Facebook.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602227.1534344744!/image/image.jpg","title":"can you help a history project","story":"\nDid you ever work in the old Mayfair manufacturing company in Portadown? If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority (EA) has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the

for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to

placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players. I play good players.’ Scott’s success as both player and manager secured his place in history but his dedication to his club, players and fans ensured his place as a legend of the game.”\n\nYou can vote online at https://dof.belfastcity.gov.uk/NameTheRoadVote/  or by emailing NameTheRoad@BelfastCity.gov.uk with Elisha Scott in the subject and including your name and address.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"lisa smyth increased workforce cant keep up with demand","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

People are living longer and are also getting sicker.\n\nConditions such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, hypertension and depression are all on the rise, and more people are being diagnosed with a combination of these illnesses. The fact is the increased workforce is not keeping up with demand.\n\nOf course, clerical staff play a vital role in keeping the health service running but it is somewhat troubling to hear that there is almost one person performing administrative roles to every nurse in the health service.\n\nIt is even more concerning when you hear that nurses are sharing desks with 16 other people and spending up to an hour filling in a form every time a patient is admitted to a ward.\n\nIt\u0027s a vicious circle inadequate remuneration and a crushing workload are not an attractive prospect to anyone looking for a job, yet while we struggle to fill vacancies, working conditions will never improve.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"building ban for co down town after sewage system gets overloaded","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

residents in the area who had raised the issue. \n\nGrand Jury Road was one of the main areas where the issue was noticed. \n\n\nBBC reports\n two new developments which will provide 30 homes are under construction on Grand Jury Road, with planning permission in place for a further 20 homes on the road.\n\nSaintfield was flooded during torrential downpours at the end of July, which impacted businesses and homes across Northern Ireland. \n\n\n\n\nMonth of rain in just few hours leads to widespread flooding across Northern Ireland\n\n\n\n\nAccording to NI Water, the problem of sewage

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"quaker funding for belfast charity with alleged dissident links must be stopped unionists","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The group offers a mediation service for people threatened with paramilitary \u0027punishment\u0027 attacks. \n\nThe Times yesterday reported that the charity had been under investigation by the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland for the past 16 months.\n\nMr Beattie said: \"I have very real concerns about the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust funding Conflict Resolution Services Ireland. All funding should be stopped immediately to allow for investigation of the charity.\"\n\nEast Belfast DUP MP Gavin Robinson said: \"Serious questions must be answered by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Charity Commission must ensure a full investigation is carried out.\"\n\nMr Robinson said it was \"in the interest of public security and transparency\" that all questions about funding were addressed.\n\nFormer CRSI employee Carl Reilly (42) faces directing terrorism charges. He was arrested in 2015 after police swooped on CRSI offices on the Falls Road and Ardoyne Avenue, seizing documents and computers.\n\nThe items taken belonged to Republican Network for Unity (RNU), which gives political advice to dissident organisation Oglaigh na hEireann (ONH), and its prisoner support group Cogus.\n\nIn a statement, the trust said it had \"no relationship with armed groups or proscribed organisations\".\n\nIt said its \"demilitarisation funding\" was \"only for those organisations which are committed to tackling the legacy of conflict-related violence and are seeking ways to bring about positive change in their communities\".\n\nThe trust said that The Times reported \"historic allegations\" against four people associated with CRSI. \"Three out of four of these allegations relate to periods before the individual concerned became associated with the charity,\" it said. \n\n\"In the fourth case, the individual\u0027s employment with the charity was terminated after his arrest.\" \n\nThe statement continued: \"During a two-year period leading up to their most recent grant, CRSI sought to mediate on behalf of 704 individuals who felt they were under threat of paramilitary violence.\n\n\"CRSI were able to successfully resolve almost all of these cases: protecting lives and reducing harm. CRSI have also made a significant contribution by their engagement with republicans who are outside the peace process.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"activists urge catholic church to change tack on lgbt issues","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I ask everyone to pray that this great festival will be a moment of joy and serenity, a caress of Jesus\u0027s tender love for all families, and indeed, for all God\u0027s children.\"\n\nEchoing Pope John Paul II when he visited Ireland in 1979, Pope Francis added: \"Young people are the future.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37240406.ece/cfbbe/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Pope_in_Ireland_008.jpg","title":"pope in ireland thousands expected to line dublin streets for pontiff parade are you going","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexiteer jacob reesmogg tells pm to chuck chequers agreement","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Theresa May’s Chequers proposals would shackle us to the EU forever.\n\n\n\nIt is time to take back control and believe in Britain.\nJacob Rees-Mogg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe. This is why the Prime Minister should ‘chuck Chequers’ and instead seek a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU to make the most of the global opportunities that lie ahead.\n\n“It is time the Government realised that the EU stands to lose much from no deal being agreed and stopped being cowed by the EU’s threats.\n\n“It is time to face down vested interests in the establishment and put democracy first. Yet most of all, it is time ‘to chuck Chequers’, respect the referendum, be out of Europe, take back control and believe in Britain.”\n\nThe briefing note states the Chequers deal would “prevent taking back control of our borders”, and warns proposals for “reciprocal mobility arrangements” are “dangerously close to free movement”.\n\nThe intervention comes as the Government prepares to publish papers outlining its planning for a possible no-deal Brexit.\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab is due to give a speech on Thursday to coincide with the release of the first of a raft of papers on more than 80 subjects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheresa May has been urged by several Tory colleagues to dump her Chequers proposals on Brexit (Dominic Lipinski/PA)\n\n\n\n\nIt follows his assurances that EU citizens living in the UK will not be “turfed out” if no deal is agreed with Brussels, as he vowed to “move swiftly” to safeguard their future.\n\nMr Raab said he is confident of reaching an agreement, but sought to reassure those living in Britain that ministers would act quickly to secure their position if the UK crashes out of the EU.\n\nThe Cabinet minister told the BBC: “We hugely value the contribution of EU citizens here in the UK and I am confident that in the unlikely eventuality that we don’t have a deal, we will move swiftly to secure their position.”\n\nHe said it is “inconceivable we would do anything other than make sure that they are legally in a position where they’re secure to stay”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn has pointed out differences on Labour and Tory policy on Brexit (David Cheskin/PA)\n\n\n\n\nHe added: “There’s absolutely no question that we’re going to see EU citizens turfed out – we’ve made that clear in the past, I’ve made that clear in the past, I’m happy to give that reassurance again today.”\n\nAhead of the publication of the papers, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn insisted there is an “absolutely massive” difference between the Brexit policies of Labour and the Conservatives.\n\nSpeaking in Glasgow, Mr Corbyn said: “There’s a massive difference because we are not looking for a no-deal Brexit as many Tory MPs are. We’re not looking to do a deregulatory sweetheart deal with Donald Trump.\n\n“We’re looking instead for an economy that invests for the future, gives rights at work, consumer rights, and environmental protection to everybody in our society.\n\n“The difference between Labour and the Tories is absolutely massive on this.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"the big bang theory to end after","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.
