This risks undermining the Government’s ambitious target to have almost one million EVs on Irish roads by 2030, which is being promoted as one of the main ways to decarbonise Irish transport, he added.Alternative policies with a more beneficial impact on EV adoption while reducing social inequity are offered in other jurisdictions, they add. These include free-interest free loans for a new EV purchase – available in Scotland – and allowing for a longer repayment period for buyers.Financial barrierData on installation of EV household chargers are used in the study as a proxy for EV ownership. The results indicate urban areas are more likely to see higher concentrations of EV ownership, and an income and equity gap exists between those who have adapted electric mobility. This “suggests that lower-income categories may have a financial barrier to shifting to EVs”.“Our findings demonstrate a correlation between high income and affluent areas and the density of household EV charging points. This is perhaps not that surprising given the high costs of purchasing a new EV compared to a non-EV,” Prof Caulfield added.The research shows, however, areas with higher numbers of EV charging points also have higher levels of car ownership, suggesting the EV may be the second or third car in the household. The analysis also suggests, specifically in Dublin, that areas with higher levels of charging points are also areas with higher levels of public transport usage.“Our research challenges the current model of providing support grants for household charging installations. Moreover, our findings suggest grants are most prominent in affluent, urban areas with high levels of public transport usage andor availability,” Prof Caulfield said.Affluent areasThe study finds “significant pockets of forced car ownership in Ireland and that in these pockets, mainly in rural areas, there are considerably fewer public transport alternatives”.The strong uptake in affluent areas has the potential of having an impact upon equity and just transition as the country seeks to decarbonise and “if the price of traditional fuels increase, such policies could have a disproportionate impact upon those living in deprived areas with lower income levels”.Alternatively, grants for commercial vehicles, which tend to have a higher turnover, can facilitate development of a secondhand market and increase EVs’ affordability, the study says. A grant scheme for taxis and other small public service vehicles was introduced recently.“Such initiatives are expected to mature the EV market and bring price parity closer in time through exposure to technology. However, we argue that none of the policies aiming at private vehicle fleet growth will sufficiently address equity concerns,” Prof Caulfield said.“Only transforming how we travel can reduce transport inequalities. Therefore, it is advisable to increase the support for sustainable and inclusive mobility strategies, such as shifting to walking, cycling and affordable public transport, reducing the demand for travel through compact development and enhancing rural accessibility as envisioned in the governmental plans.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mixed views over mick wallace voting against eu condemnation of invasion","story":"Mick Wallace  MEP. ‘I do get his thoughts around Nato. They’re a pack of bullies, in my opinion, but you have a situation where civilians are being bombed.’ Photograph: Eric LukeStanding off Wexford’s historic Bull Ring, where a one-man protest over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been taking place this week, James Watts believes local MEP Mick Wallace likes to be “the odd man out”.“I just feel he likes to be contrary,” says Watt about Wallace, who voted against a European Parliament condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “I like him, but I just feel he does it for the sake of it sometimes.”Defending himself on South East Radio on Wednesday, Wallace said 13 MEPs, including Dublin’s Claire Daly, had shown courage by voting against the motion supported by 637 MEPs.Saying he has stood by past election pledges, Wallace said: “You’ll even see it in my leaflet. We said that we will oppose the militarisation of Europe lock, stock and barrel, that we would work for peace and that we would challenge all war.”Today Watts, who voted for Wallace in Dáil elections previously, says he is “numb” at the positions now taken by the MEP. “Maybe here he was a big fish in a small pond, and now it’s the opposite. Acknowledging Wallace’s “militarisation argument”, retired civil servant Sean Crowe nevertheless wondered: “What are you supposed to do when the aggressor attacks a country? Are you supposed to forget about the right to defend your country? I don’t accept it, to be quite honest about it.”Jim Breen, the man holding the protest with a “Russia, Get Out of Ukraine” placard beneath a statue commemorating the pikemen who fought in the 1798 rebellion, is adamant that Wallace is wrong.“He’s voted wrong,” says Breen, a former Labour Party supporter. “He should have voted in favour. One child being murdered is one too many. I would vote with my conscience. “I did vote for him in the past and I might do so again. But on this he’s wrong. People in Russia can’t do what I’m doing here – I was able to take a notion to come down here with my sign,” he told The . CiviliansBack at the Bullring, Kyle Kemp (30) also feels Wallace made the wrong call.“I do get his thoughts around Nato. They’re a pack of bullies, in my opinion, but you have a situation where civilians are being bombed.” He said in the past he admired Russian president Vladimir Putin. “He was a man’s man, someone a young man like myself could look up to. I was taken in by the propaganda, basically.” However, he believes there has been “hypocrisy” in the way in which the Ukrainian invasion has been covered compared with that given to Syria, or Yemen. It is down to the “skin colour of people involved”.Even though he shares some of Wallace’s views, Kemp did not vote for Wallace in the past. Asked for his preferences, he lifted up his top to reveal tattoos of Patrick Pearse and an Easter lily. “I’m a Sinn Féin supporter.” Meanwhile, Helen Foran does not sympathise with Wallace, and believes other countries “should be going in to help” Ukraine. Yet she also fears it could spark World War three. “I just feel so sorry for the people,” she says. Not everyone is a critic, though. Three older men seated outside a coffee shop declined to be quoted, but said Wallace had their full support for his stance, and they also criticised coverage of the invasion.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"alan kelly s toppling what happened behind the scenes","story":"Outgoing Labour Party leader Alan Kelly: There was a general feeling he had become “semi-detached” and “didn’t realise the extent” of the difficulties the party was facing.  Photograph: Alan Betson The finishing touches to the plan to take down Alan Kelly were applied in the home of Labour Senator Marie Sherlock last Sunday. The party had recorded yet another dismal result in the Business PostRed C poll, published that morning – 4 per cent.The party’s Senators and TDs gathered at Sherlock’s Phibsboro home – those who couldn’t make it physically dialled in from elsewhere. Brendan Howlin attended briefly from London, where he was with the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly.The purpose of the meeting was to copper-fasten an approach that had been emerging as concerns about the leadership reached a point of no return. The party has plenty of recent experience in decapitating leaders: Eamon Gilmore in 2014 and Joan Burton in 2016, and is still traumatised by the memory of the tortuous end of Gilmore’s tenure, spread over two days.And so, if they were going to move against another leader, it would have to be quick and straightforward. Kelly would have to be presented with a fait accompli – that he would go, or face a motion of no confidence from all 10 other members of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP).Across the last week, the party has descended into crisis mode – first privately, and then very publicly. The fallout has destabilised the party, confused its membership and damaged its standing. Now, the hope is that a new leader will take the reins and restore the sense of purpose, identity and electoral success that have evaded the party for the guts of a decade.Before a new leadership could begin, the messy process of ushering Kelly out had to be completed.Reasons for defenestrationLabour members have stated that the reasons for Kelly’s defenestration lie in the polling numbers, and a fear that he was too strongly associated with the Labour-Fine Gael government of 2011-2016. These concerns permeated discussions at PLP meetings for several weeks. But it’s also the case that another trigger was concerns over filling a backroom position in the party. It’s believed Billie Sparks, the party’s general secretary, last week indicated to members that she was uncomfortable with parts of the process, while Ged Nash, the Louth TD and finance spokesman, was said by colleagues to be particularly annoyed with aspects.A Labour spokesman said the party had a duty of confidentiality regarding career-sensitive information and would not comment on internal matters. But in a series of conversations with Labour figures in recent days, nobody was denying the suggestion.An emergency meeting was held last Wednesday among some PLP members, in Kelly’s absence, where all this was discussed. The following day, at a meeting in Leinster House of the full PLP, Kelly was confronted with these concerns, and with more worries about performance, and also culture.A source present said there were accusations of a damaging culture within the party, with fingers pointed at the leader’s office. “Things were said that were very difficult to hear,” one source said. Kelly defended himself, becoming emotional at one point, but the defence offered was insufficient to convince members – he had lost authority, some present felt.The events of last week brought to a head concerns that had been forming over time. There was, one said, a general feeling that Kelly had become “semi-detached” and that he “didn’t realise the extent” of the difficulties the party was facing, amid what members fretted was an inexorable slide towards irrelevance, and potentially to extinction. Fingal TD Duncan Smith, Senator Mark Wall and Sherlock all spoke of a fight for survival in interviews on RTÉ on Thursday.Tight-lipped behaviourThe developments were kept on lockdown – PLP members mixed with councillors and other Labour figures at a protest at the Russian embassy on Saturday, but kept tight-lipped. The backdrop of the Labour Party going to war with itself, while an actual war raged, was not lost on members. Smith said on Wednesday it was “mortifying” to be on the radio talking about Labour in this context. But also, as he said himself, “when you start to say things out loud, to each other, and decisions are made, then things take a momentum of their own”.That momentum brought the PLP together on Sunday. It was decided that Smith, Wall and Cork East TD Seán Sherlock would go to Kelly. They were chosen because they were close to him – the Tipperary TD could be left in no doubt about the single-mindedness of his party. Wall and Smith have said they presented him on Tuesday with their analysis of polling and that he was tainted, and the reality was he had lost support. He quickly agreed to go.Labour’s parliamentary team is facing a problem. The wider party, including many councillors, are deeply disillusioned with the decision to jettison Kelly. They don’t understand the logic of it, and while there is a case to be made against Kelly, there is also an equally strong case for the defence. Taking down a leader of a small party based on poor polling, in the middle of an election cycle, before they’ve had a chance to fight a local, general or European election runs contrary to political wisdom – even more so when he has been limited by the pandemic.“The overwhelming phone calls, texts, tweets, whatsapps I’m getting from members is that they’re annoyed,” says Dermot Lacey, a Dublin city councillor and party stalwart. “It all doesn’t make sense to me. And that’s one of the things people are saying to me. ‘What is this all about?’”“I’m genuinely very shocked by the whole thing,” said Ciaran Ahern, a former Seanad and general election candidate.“I’m disappointed that there was a leadership election less than two years ago, and it’s been overturned by the PLP,” said Ben Slimm, a Kerry councillor.From early on Wednesday morning, Kelly began to call some supporters telling them he was gone. A helter-skelter day followed as word crept out, with journalists pursuing party members (sometimes at pace) down the corridors of Leinster House, and the party’s plan to announce on Thursday was blown to smithereens. More than once, the whole process has been closer to farce than drama. Whether Labour can restore itself under a new leader remains to be seen."},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics europe s turning point","story":"Russia\u0027s invasion of Ukraine has brought about enormous changes in European policy in an incredibly short space of time.

Ms Flynn was given a round of applause by TDs present after speaking to the chamber about a recent Oireachtas committee, which she chaired, on issues facing the Traveller Community. Her husband Liam and daughter Billie were present in the Dáil’s visitor’s gallery to hear her speak. In her opening remarks, Ms Flynn said one of the ushers in Leinster House had said to her ‘Eileen remember, you’re not in there for nothing, you’re in there because you deserve to be in there’. “I thought it was an absolutely lovely comment for me, for when I came in,” she said. Ms Flynn said the State could not continue to deny opportunities to the Traveller community, which had been done “for generations”. “Now it is time for us all to move forward together,” she said. “We have to let bygones be bygones and we need to move forward together.”Ms Flynn pointed out that the Oireachtas committee’s report on issues facing the Traveller community had set out 84 recommendations, the vast majority of which were “not new” but just “haven’t been implemented”. She said a national Traveller accommodation authority was required and that “time and time again we see local authorities underspend their allocation of funding for the Travelling community”. “Between 2008 and 2019 local authorities left more than €72 million in funding underspent, yet the needs of Traveller accommodation are as serious as ever,” she said. Ms Flynn also said there needed to be a standalone national Traveller mental health strategy and a steering group to ensure its implementation, which would work with stakeholders and Travellers. “We are moving towards a better Ireland for everybody but it needs to be a more inclusive Ireland. The money is there. It is about implementing it and changing people’s lives.”“I could be wrong, I’d say you would go far to find Travellers employed in any Government department,” he said. The Dublin South-West TD said South Dublin County Council had employed members of the Traveller community to carry out masonry work in Seán Keating Garden in Rathfarnam and there was “no reason why every chief executive of every local authority in this country cannot do it”.Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said there had “certainly” been members of the Traveller community working in Leinster House, but “sadly not enough”. “We might encourage deputies and senators to look to the Traveller community when they are employing staff themselves and the political parties.”Minister of State Malcolm Noonan said it was critical that the findings of the report were addressed at a “whole-of-government level and right across the Houses of the Oireachtas” and that the State worked with all partner agencies and the Traveller and Roma communities. “We see persistent discrimination, including at political level when there is intervention in housing allocations,” he said. “We see Traveller families, particularly young Travellers, hiding themselves from view rather than celebrating their heritage and culture.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn f%C3%A9in member apologises for telling td she was an effing eejit for becoming pregnant","story":"Violet Anne Wynne had said she felt ‘pressurised’ and was not given autonomy to hire her own staff.A remark that former Sinn Féin TD Violet-Anne Wynne was an “effing eejit” for becoming pregnant was “unacceptable” and a party member has apologised for it, Sinn Féin has said.Earlier this week Ms Wynne said she was told by a “prominent” female member of the party she was an “effing eejit” for becoming pregnant again and said she was anxious relaying the news of her pregnancy to the party.

Photograph: Sem van der WalEPAA week after Russia invaded Ukraine one of the greatest ever mobilisations of Nato member armed forces is under way.About 22,000 additional Nato member troops have been moved into eastern Europe, bringing military equipment with them, while at least 20 countries – mostly Nato members – are supplying arms to Ukraine.Even before the invasion Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg pointed out how alliance members had begun to increase its presence in the air, on land and at sea.Now, for the first time, Nato has activated its rapid-reaction response force (NRF), comprising 40,000 troops, including from non-alliance countries such as Finland and Sweden.“What we have done over the last weeks and months is to significantly increase our presence in the eastern part of the alliance: in the Baltic countries, in Romania, in Poland, ” said Mr Stoltenberg on Tuesday. “We have activated Nato defence plans so we can more easily move troops throughout Europe – and we can further reinforce our presence in the east.”US vice-president Kamala Harris has spoken this week with all heads of government along Nato’s eastern flank and “reaffirmed our iron-clad commitment” to Nato’s mutual defence.In these calls a spokesman for Harris said she reviewed “recent and upcoming US and Nato force posture adjustments in Europe, including the deployment of thousands of US troops and critical capabilities to reinforce our deterrence posture and collective defence”.TaboosAs EU shock over Russia’s invasion gave way to resolve, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen noted on Tuesday that “European security and defence has evolved more in the last six days than in the last two decades”.Until last weekend Berlin refused the idea of supplying weapons that could be used against victims of Nazi totalitarianism. But on Saturday Germany shifted and is now supplying – directly or via third countries – grenade-launchers as well as anti-tank and anti-aircraft rockets.In 2011 Poland’s then foreign minister Radek Sikorski – with an eye on growing Russian tensions with its neighbours – said he found “German inaction scarier than German action” in Europe.A decade on, in a previously unthinkable move, German warplanes are flying armed patrols over Polish airspace. As well as refuelling allied jets over Poland and Romania – 400km from Crimea – German Tornado warplanes and a maritime patrol aircraft have been sent to patrol the Baltic Sea.An overview of member activity and Nato deployments across the continent.ROMANIA: 300 Belgian troops, 150 Dutch troops and a French NRF army battalion, as well as 12 Italian and six German Eurofighter jets.POLAND: Unspecified number of French Rafale fighter jets and German Tornado reconnaissance planes patrolling Polish air space 32 US attack helicopters to the Baltic StatesPoland15,000 US troops deployed mostly in the BalticPoland region, supplementing 5,500 Europe-based US troops moved eastward to Poland.SLOVAKIA: Additional 250 German soldiers join 1,200 alliance troops German “Patriot” air-defence system, manned by German soldiers, along with Dutch, Czech, Polish, Slovenian and US soldiers.BALTIC: 150 Spanish soldiers for Latvia as well as 30 Canadian soldiers, artillery \u0026amp electronic warfare units 100 extra Dutch soldiers, 60 Norwegians for Lithuania 350 extra German soldiers deployed to Lithuania battlegroup, bringing the Bundeswehr presence to 1,200 four French Mirage fighter jets and 200 soldiers for Estonia, along with 1,000 UK troops and Challenger tanks.

has jumped by nearly 200,000 in a month, with 35 to 49-year-olds now the most likely to report ongoing problems.The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that 1.52 million people – one in 41 – were experiencing at least one symptom four weeks after recovering from an infection, an increase of 15 per cent from 1.33 million last month.People in their mid to late 30s and 40s were the most likely to be impacted – a reflection of how many working-age younger groups became infected during the omicron wave.Nearly a million people in Britain said long Covid was negatively affecting their daily lives, while 685,000 said they were still experiencing symptoms more than a year after recovering from the virus.The figures show that 1.1 million (71 per cent) had been struggling with symptoms for at least 12 weeks since an infection.Self-reported long Covid is defined as symptoms persisting for more than four weeks after a first suspected virus infection that could not be explained by something else.Although it is still not fully understood, many people continue to experience debilitating symptoms after a Covid infection, including extreme tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pain, memory problems, insomnia, heart palpitations, dizziness and joint pain.Fatigue continues to be the most common symptom – experienced by 51 per cent of those with self-reported long Covid in the ONS survey – followed by shortness of breath (35 per cent) and loss of smell (34 per cent), with a quarter of people continuing to experience loss of taste and having difficulty concentrating.Some 281,000 (18 per cent) reported that their ability to undertake day-to-day activities had been limited a lot by symptoms.The ONS said prevalence was greatest in people deprived areas, those working in teaching and education, social care or healthcare, and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability. These groups also align with those most at risk from Covid in general.Women were also found to report more symptoms, although studies have shown that they are generally better at spotting symptoms for most illnesses. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: West calls for calm after Russian shelling starts fire at power plantUkraine accuses Russia of \u0026#39nuclear terrorism\u0026#39 after fire at power plant spreads panicWhat will life look for Roman Abramovich now?Friday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The How imposing martial law would enable Vladimir Putin to crush dissent in RussiaWhat nuclear weapons does Russia hold and how likely is Putin to use them?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"peacemaker casual observer china could do next","story":"Beijing is trying to position itself as a peacemaker in Ukraine, not wanting to be seen as an accomplice to Putin’s aggression. But that is hardly credible while China continues to support Russia’s war aims, and will not condemn its leader’s invasion.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told his Ukrainian counterpart that Beijing is concerned about the harm to civilians and “looks forward to China playing a role in realising a ceasefire”. He has repeated the Communist Party’s well-worn mantra about “the territorial integrity of all countries”. Ukraine has appealed to Beijing to exert its influence over Putin.Yet Beijing has avoided even using the word ‘invasion’ and continues to echo Moscow’s talking points, that the conflict is the fault of Nato, Ukraine, the US – anybody apart from Putin. But if China cannot or will not see what is obvious to the rest of the world, what possible role can it play as a mediator – especially when so many of its actions suggest duplicity?Hours after the invasion, Beijing lifted restrictions on wheat imports from Russia and is moving ahead with large-scale energy deals, including a new long-term gas contract with Gazprom. China also reaffirmed that its ultimate aim is to expand the use of its own currency, the yuan, in all trade settlements between the two countries. In the short term these moves will cushion the blow of western sanctions on the Russian economy, and in effect underwrite Putin’s Ukrainian aggression. In the longer term it will serve the aims of both countries to achieve financial immunity by building an alternative payments system to that dominated by the US dollar.China’s official media has also avoided calling Russia’s action an “invasion”, urging restraint on “all parties”. Social media has been less restrained, with nationalist bloggers, always allowed more leeway, cheering on Putin. The sentence “Nato still owes the Chinese people a debt of blood”, created by the state-run People’s Daily, became the top hashtag on social media platform Weibo. It refers to the 1999 accidental bombing by Nato of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in which three people died, and was viewed more than a billion times.Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are close personally – Xi once described Putin as his “best friend”. They made a big show of their partnership at a summit ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics – Xi describing their friendship as having “no limits”. At that meeting, Xi for the first time explicitly endorsed Russia’s demand for an end to Nato expansion.China does not have formal allies in the Western sense. It does not fit with Beijing’s sense of its own centrality, which is incompatible with an alliance system that might require obligations, commitments and a degree of equity. But it does have a hierarchy of partnerships, of which Russia sits at the top.Joint military drills have become more frequent, more complex and more geographically spread. They have gone beyond symbolic shows of camaraderie, increasingly focused on co-ordinating command and control and enhancing battlefield interoperability. The Russians also have the combat experience that the People’s Liberation Army lacks, Russian troops having fought in wars in Georgia, Chechnya, Syria and of course Ukraine. Historic animosities run deep – theirs is a marriage of convenience, but the relationship is no less dangerous for it. Putin and Xi share a deep paranoia about the West, and a loathing for western democracies. They are driven by historic grievance and victimhood, and a desire to overturn the western-led international order, against which Putin’s aggression represents a full-throated assault.In other words, Xi shares Putin’s aims. But what of his means? And did the Chinese leaders know about the invasion of Ukraine in advance? The most plausible answer is that Xi was told by Putin in broad terms, but not in detail – or he hadn’t expected Putin to be quite so crude. Western intelligence reports suggest Xi did ask Putin to delay any action until after the Winter Olympics had finished, pointing to at least some degree of foreknowledge.Xi now risks being tainted by association with the sheer barbarity of Moscow’s assault. He is left groping at a veneer of high-principled diplomacy, while unable to bring himself to condemn an act so self-evidently at odds with China’s supposed sacred principles of “non-interference”.Xi will also have been taken aback by the strength and unity of the western response as one observer recently put it, he would have preferred the invasion to have gone “uneventfully”. It is another article of faith in both Beijing and Moscow that the West is decaying, in decline and unable or unwilling to stand up for its principles. Yet western nations have been stirred by the shocking images coming out of Ukraine. Not only are Putin’s reckless actions galvanising western alliances, but the sanctions are broader and have more bite than many anticipated. China will be watching closely the fate of Moscow’s ‘war chest’, its foreign currency and gold reserves held by Russia’s central bank. They have been targeted by the west in what may turn out to be the most effective of sanctions. The reserves now total around $630 billion, and had been seen by Russia as an important buffer. Yet many are held outside the country and could now be frozen. China holds $3.4 trillion of reserves and will now be rethinking how to resist western pressure in the event of a war over Taiwan.The self-governing democratic island, which China claims as its own, is never far from the thoughts of Xi Jinping. As Putin’s tanks rolled into Ukraine, Taiwan strengthened its combat readiness and early warning systems. President Tsai Ing-wen warned that China might exploit the Ukraine conflict to step up pressure. Last weekend, the iconic Taipei 101 skyscraper was lit up in blue and yellow, the colours of the Ukrainian flag, in solidarity with Ukraine.For some weeks now, the worst nightmare for strategists in Washington has been that Moscow and Beijing were co-ordinating their actions on the Ukrainian border and in the Taiwan Strait. At the very least it is widely accepted that Xi is watching the West’s reaction to Ukraine carefully as he calibrates his own strategy towards Taiwan. He may also be calculating that by supporting (or at least refraining from criticising) Russia’s actions in Ukraine, Putin may return the compliment over Taiwan in the future.Beijing has been trying hard to discourage comparisons. It argues that Taiwan is not a sovereign state, that it has always been part of China – though this no more stands up to historic scrutiny than does Putin’s rambling questioning of Ukraine’s right to exist. Perhaps the most chilling parallel is that for Xi and Putin, the futures of Ukraine and Taiwan have nothing to do with the people who live there.Russia is the junior partner in the relationship with China, and sanctions will reinforce this, giving Beijing enormous clout – particularly in negotiating energy deals. If Putin’s aggression forces western democracies to address their longer term reliance on Russian energy, then China will become its most important market by far – and Beijing will strike a hard bargain. Beijing may also be weighing the strategic advantage if the Ukraine crisis sucks US resources back to Europe and away from the Indo-Pacific.Against that it must weigh the cost of guilt by association. For Beijing, it is not so much what Putin is doing as the fact his tools are so blunt and so visible to the world. The Chinese Communist Party has plenty of blood on its own hands, from the killing fields of Cambodia (Mao was Pol Pot’s biggest backer by far) to the deaths of millions during the Cultural Revolution and Great Leap Forward. It is a repressive state that uses multiple tools of coercion at home and abroad – but more cleverly deployed and not documented in real time in such chilling detail as we are now seeing in Ukraine.There is now a real prospect of China getting caught up in the economic and political blowback over Ukraine, and the signs are that it is now recalibrating precisely where its interests lie. The irony is that the strength of western resolve over Ukraine, if it can be sustained, will benefit Taiwan, serving as a warning over what Xi could expect if he invaded.Putin has put Beijing in a precarious position. The world was already growing wary of China – and the decisions Beijing makes over the coming days, its willingness to stand beside a pariah whose barbarism is provoking such global disgust, will shape global geo-politics for decades to come.Ian Williams is a former foreign correspondent for Channel 4 News and NBC, and author of Every Breath You Take: China’s New Tyranny.

Certainly, many people are saying that it doesn’t feel right to buy Russian at the moment. And now a spokesperson for pub chain JD Wetherspoon has announced that it is stopping the sale of a Russian beer called Baltika lager – brewed in Vladimir Putin’s home city of St Petersburg – on its premises. The spokesperson explained: “In light of the situation in Ukraine we just felt that we could not stock it any more.”Wetherspoon’s action is just the latest move in a spontaneous global decision. From Finland to New Zealand, consumers are reportedly already boycotting Russian vodka. But shunning hard liquor or a bottle of beer is just one way people can use their pockets to voice displeasure to the Kremlin. According to the United Nations Comtrade database on international trade, Britain’s Russian imports totalled £18.3 billion in 2020, ranging from precious stones to aluminium, iron and steel.“In terms of the rhinoceros skin of Putin,” says Clive Owen, a consumer analyst at investment group Shore Capital, “I’m not sure whether he’ll be worried whether Brits stop buying the finest brand of caviar or vodka. “But collectively, time will tell whether all these things add up to something that’s a better outcome for everybody.”Multinational companies are effectively starting a reverse boycott, too, by removing their goods for sale in Russia. Ikea has led the way, with fashion companies Burberry, Asos, H\u0026ampM and BooHoo, and music streaming service Spotify joining in. Also leaving Russia are Jaguar Land Rover, JCB, HSBC, BP and Shell. And Muscovites are finding they can no longer use their Mastercard or Visa payment systems.But boycotting Russian goods here is not as straightforward as it may initially seem. For starters, many brands that might appear quintessentially Russian at face value have long been absorbed into global corporations. While Smirnoff vodka originated in 19th century Russia, for example, the company is actually owned by British spirits giant Diageo, and is manufactured in Illinois, US.So from energy to pensions, how can you use your own personal spending power to make Putin pay?  Food \u0026amp drink  Russia is one of the world’s leading caviar producers with brands such as Oscietra caviar and Siberian caviar. While Smirnoff no longer has any ties to Moscow, Britain still consumes plenty of bona fide Russian spirits. UK imports such as Russian Standard Vodka, JJ Whitley Vodka and Beluga Noble Russian Vodka amounted to approximately £16 million in 2021.Russian-produced raw materials also end up in a number of everyday products. Last September, Budweiser struck a deal with aluminium giant Rusal, owned by oligarch Oleg Deripaska, to supply ultra-low carbon beer cans.    Marketing experts say that consumer pressure on major brands like Budweiser, forcing them to change their supply chain practices, is one way of targeting Russian companies.“Boycotts generally work by upsetting investors and causing long term reputational harm,” says Adrian Palmer, head of marketing and reputation at Henley Business School. “It’s much more nuanced than simply stopping sales.”Cosmetics \u0026amp healthExerting financial pressure on powerful Russian oligarchs is thought to be one way of attempting to force Putin to reconsider. UK high street chain Holland \u0026amp Barrett is owned by L1 Retail, a group controlled by billionaire Mikhail Fridman. Fridman has stepped down from the board after being placed on the EU sanctions list and his assets frozen. He has condemned the war but not, so far, Putin himself. Holland \u0026amp Barrett is keen to make it clear where the company stands, though, with a spokesperson saying: “Our thoughts are with those affected by the situation in Ukraine. We are a UK registered company that has grown over the last 150 years from one store in the UK to over 1,600 stores and operations in 19 countries around the world. “We are not affected by any sanctions, nor do we expect to be. Our focus, as always, is on supporting the wellness of our colleagues and customers.”Russia has a surprising presence in the UK healthcare market in general, largely through the company Natura Siberica Group, which was owned until last year by the late cosmetics tycoon Andrei Trubnikov, whose first wife Irina is now the majority shareholder. Based in Moscow, the corporation owns global brands Natura Siberica and Organic Kitchen, which produce a range of natural and organic skincare products such as moisturisers, shampoo and anti-ageing serums.EnergyWhile hydrocarbons are one of Russia’s main exports, Britain relies on Russia to supply only a small fraction of its gas. But despite this, there is no real way for iniduals to ensure its gas does not power or heat their home. All suppliers pool their energy before it is delivered to households via the National Grid.However, homeowners can help cut Britain\u0027s reliance on gas imports in general by choosing an energy supplier that invests in domestic renewable production. Renewable suppliers such as Good Energy and Ecotricity source their energy from renewable generators or invest into renewable infrastructure.These firms are not protected by the energy price cap, however, making their deals much more expensive than traditional energy tariffs. Good Energy’s standard variable tariff costs £2,230 a year. This is 75 per cent, or £953, more than the cheapest traditional dealsTechnologyThese are also uncertain times for a number of high profile oligarchs who own UK football clubs. Chelsea supremo Roman Abramovich, who has long had close links to Putin, has already announced the handing over of the “stewardship and care” of the club to the trustees of its charitable foundation, and has since announced he is selling the club. Scrutiny is also being directed towards petrochemicals magnate Maxim Demin who owns AFC Bournemouth, and Uzbek-born Russian citizen Alisher Usmanov who is a close associate of Everton owner Farhad Moshiri. Usmanov’s company USM Holdings sponsors Everton’s training ground, a link that has come under increasing criticism after the EU made the decision to freeze Usmanov’s assets.Jewellery \u0026amp luxuryRussia is a major exporter of gold, selling more than £13.7 billion of it in 2020 alone, according to the United Nations’ trade database. Its global exchange means that some of this gold may have ended up in your jewellery box. In 2019, Russia exported more than £74.6 million in jewellery across the world, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.If you are looking to buy jewellery or bullion and concerned that it may have links to Russia, it is best to contact the seller. They will be able to dig further back into a particular product’s supply chain than you can by yourself. If you have already bought a jewellery item and you are concerned that the metal may originate from Russia, you might be able to sell it or exchange it with your retailer for a better deal, as the price of gold has moved up 5 per cent since the start of the year.Russian companies such as the Imperial Porcelain Factory in St Petersburg also export a number of products to luxury department stores such as Harrods and Selfridges.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: West calls for calm after Russian shelling starts fire at power plantUkraine accuses Russia of \u0026#39nuclear terrorism\u0026#39 after fire at power plant spreads panicWhat will life look for Roman Abramovich now?Friday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The How imposing martial law would enable Vladimir Putin to crush dissent in RussiaWhat nuclear weapons does Russia hold and how likely is Putin to use them?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tudor women not just henry viiis wives looked","story":"Henry VIII was never a man of Catholic tastes. He may have married six times, but the women he chose, with the exception of Anne Boleyn, were decidedly similar in the way they looked – at least to judge by their portraits. The recent discovery that a painting long believed to represent Catherine Parr, Henry’s sixth wife, is actually a portrait of Catherine of Aragon, his first, has led curators at Hever Castle to a bold conclusion. Henry VIII had a “type”.  The king married the Spanish widow of his late brother Arthur in 1509 when he was 17 and she 23. Catherine was said to be a woman of beauty and ‘agreeable and dignified manners’. Henry certainly had no objections on that front. Catherine had thick auburn hair and pale skin, both qualities much admired in Tudor England. Catherine Parr, who married Henry in 1543, just a few years before he died, was also auburn-haired and pale-faced. A contemporary portrait by the artist William Scrots shows her to have had elegantly arched eyebrows, delicate features and hazel eyes. Like Catherine of Aragon, who in the Hever Castle portrait has boldly painted lips and cheeks, she has an elegantly small nose. This is not the first time the two women have been confused. A portrait at Lambeth Palace thought to show Catherine Parr has similarly been reanalysed and declared to be a likeness of Catherine of Aragon. Meanwhile, the identification of a portrait miniature by Hans Holbein, believed to capture Catherine Howard, was thrown open to question last year, with an art historian suggesting that the sitter was actually Anne of Cleves. One major difference between Catherine of Aragon and Catherine Parr would have been difficult to capture in portraiture. While the former was rather short and of a healthy build – a miniature shows her to have had a positively fleshy face and blue eyes – the latter was willowy and the tallest of Henry’s wives. Parr’s height would have given her an advantage at a time when women were admired for extra inches. Mary, Queen of Scots was striking at almost six feet tall.  But there is no escaping the fact that the Hever Castle portrait is highly stylised. No Holbein, it is comparatively flat and lifeless, making Catherine of Aragon look less like a human than a porcelain doll. Her fair hair and pale skin have been highlighted intentionally because they were believed to reflect inner purity and cleanliness of soul. Such was the fashion for both that even women outside the court resorted to lightening their flesh and tresses with serums and balms. Venetian Ceruse, a white foundation of white lead and vinegar, was liberally applied to the face, and sulphur and saffron were similarly used for bleaching and blonding. An artist’s paintbrush had the potential to do an even better job of it. This is a portrait painted to reassure a king prone to paranoia. The painting indeed takes on fresh meaning when one looks at it in light of Henry’s ensuing love life. Anne Boleyn, the woman he left Catherine of Aragon for, was her antithesis in many ways. Far from being fair and ‘pure’, she was unique among Henry’s wives for being ‘Brunet’ (brunette) with dark eyes and possibly a sixth finger on one hand. Although described as ‘not one of the handsomest women in the world’, Boleyn had wit and allure, for she was able to use her eyes, it was said, ‘with effect’.  Given how their relationship ended – Boleyn was the first of the wives to be beheaded – it makes psychological sense that Henry should have reverted to type. Jane Seymour, the next in line, had fair hair and blue eyes. Poor Anne of Cleves, while described as ‘of middling beauty, with a determined and resolute countenance,’ famously disappointed Henry, who declared her ‘nothing so fair as she had been reported’.  It may well be that Henry was rather unimaginative where looks were concerned. He wouldn’t be the first man to go after the same type of woman repeatedly, especially if certain attributes held the promise of an easier life, and lived up to existing conventions of beauty. Women outside the aristocracy may have faced fewer pressures to conform, but many were drawn to emulate the styles of the royal court nevertheless, thereby helping to perpetuate them. To suppose that hair and colouring were the top of the king’s agenda, however, when there were things like alliances and wealth to be considered, would be naive.  The similarity of many of the portraits instead illustrates just how simply women were viewed by some artists in line with expectations of the time. It is often said that a true portraitist captures the soul of their sitter, but the opaque and often ageless women preserved down the centuries did not so much have their souls painted as whitewashed, an effect that went deeper than any solution of lead and powder they applied to their faces. The irony of course was that royal women were always watched, Elizabeth I once commenting, “A thousand eyes see all I do.” It took a brave artist, and an understanding audience, to see them truly as they were. Daisy Dunn’s new book, Not Far From Brideshead: Oxford Between the Wars, is published on 31 March.

Mixed-martial arts has done well, but that was hardly new, just rebranded. Ultimate frisbee had its moment, then stayed niche – or in the park. The less said about quidditch the better.But the latest invention has it all: it’s fun, adrenaline-fuelled, requires very little exertion, brings people together, and all you need is an internet connection. It’s called “oligarch hunting”. At the moment, the best place to play is on the high seas, and you might as well join in – at least until the Government does...Since before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, social media users have been keeping an eye on the influential, at least multi-millionaire business magnates and Vladimir Putin associates that make up “the oligarchs”. Fearing government sanctions, the suspicion was that they might attempt to sell off their assets, or at least move their interests elsewhere in order to stop them being seized, and perhaps even move themselves to a safe haven.Then Putin invaded, the US and EU announced sanctions for iniduals, and suddenly – well, not actually very suddenly, especially in the UK’s case – the starting gun fired. For oligarch-hunters, it was open season. “Tonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: no more,” President Biden said in his State of the Union address on Tuesday. “We’re joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.”Yee-haw. Many hunters kept eyes on the men themselves. Some mapped their properties. Within days, a Twitter account called Russian Oligarch Jets (twitterruoligarchjets) was set up by Floridian teenager Jack Sweeney, who monitors flight trackers to make sure no oligarch gets airborne without social media knowing about it.But best of all is #YachtWatch, a hashtag around which a community of Twitter users gather to keep abreast of precisely where the gargantuan motor yachts owned by those on sanctions lists are currently anchored. Oligarchs like luxury yachts as much as the next reclusive mega-rich business mogul with potentially murderous friends, and as major assets, those vessels could be seized by authorities looking to freeze assets.Knowing this, many have already set off for the Males, Montenegro, the Seychelles or the Caribbean, where they are out of reach from EU or US authorities, and in some cases safe from even US extradition treaties. The Males and the Seychelles are perhaps most attractive, given so much of the Caribbean has historic or geographical ties with the US and UK, and sit surrounded by international waters. European authorities are now under pressure to be alert to floating assets being moved. If authorities in European countries wanted to stop anything leaving port, they could easily do so by simply not stamping a passport, but until then, in legal terms, the luxury vessels have become flight risks. #YachtWatch is there to try and stop them.Rumours swirl every day about seizures. While many turn out to be false (an early report showing Norwegian authorities aboard one superyacht was, in fact, a routine inspection), it was reported yesterday that French customs officers have seized Amore Vero, an 88-metre luxury vessel owned by Igor Sechin, head of Russian state energy company Rosneft, who is subject to EU sanctions. Amore Vero, “True Love”, was meant to stay in port for a month. On Wednesday, officers noticed the yacht was “taking steps to sail off urgently, without the repair works being over”, so they decided to seize it.Later, it was reported that the world’s largest motor yacht by gross tonnage, the 156-metre Dilbar, had been seized in Hamburg, where it is moored for maintenance. This was later denied by the shipyard in question, but Dilbar’s owner, metal tycoon and Everton FC owner Alisher Usmanov, is also on the EU sanctions list, and given the vessel is worth an estimated $800m, being anchored in Germany may make it a sitting duck.Among those stuck in Europe is Solaris, Roman Abramovich’s 140m giga-yacht (loosely, the distinction is that a super is over 37m, a mega over 60m, and a giga over 100m), which is photographed almost daily by #YachtWatch in Barcelona, where it is being maintained. His other, even bigger one, Eclipse, is in Saint Martin in the Caribbean.“Those places aren’t out of the ordinary for this time of year,” says Jackson’s colleague, Jack Hogan, “so there’s been some exaggeration at the moment. They’re all heading to fairly standard destinations.” Standard – but highly convenient, too.The yachts are absurdly equipped things, and given they can cost almost $1 billion, are usually bought on finance, with banks happy to offer vast loans to customers whose net worth makes the cost of the vessel a drop in the ocean. Yesterday, it was reported in the Financial Times that Credit Suisse has asked hedge funds and other investors to destroy documents relating to its richest clients’ yachts and private jets, in an attempt to stop information leaking about loans made to oligarchs who are being sanctioned. (To date, Credit Suisse has declined to comment.)Abramovich’s Eclipse is estimated to have cost around $700 million. It has an armour-plated master suite, two swimming pools, two helipads, a cinema, a mini-submarine and its own missile defence system. But it would also have 60-odd crew on board, most of whom probably aren’t Russian (they’re often European or Filipino). Yachts of that size now often have a “shadow vessel”, which acts as a support boat to carry unwieldy things or extra staff, following them everywhere.“In general, crew or anyone who works for a large corporation, focuses on their job at hand and maintaining standards. But the way the sanctions are structured, it’ll make it fairly difficult to work on board. It’ll be a tough time for them,” Hogan says.Recently, it was reported that the entire crew of a superyacht owned by a “high up” member of the Russian military resigned in protest against their boss. Nautilus International, the maritime trade union, has also urged members working on Russian-owned yachts to sign up.Much is still unknown about how #YachtWatch will end. If a vessel is seized, for instance, what then? How the EU deals with its first catches this week may set the standard. Until that plays out, the sanctioned oligarchs’ superyachts will either stay where they are, or hit the open seas. But these aren’t oil tankers: they’ll need fuel and maintenance before long, in ports that can support them, and every vessel sails under a flag (often from a tax haven, such as the Cayman Islands or Bermuda), under whose laws it must comply. Laws can change.One notable megayacht that sails under the right flag, and whose owner is definitely under scrutiny, is Graceful. It is allegedly owned by Putin himself, and is one of the few vessels of its kind to have high-tailed straight to the safest place for a paranoid oligarch at the moment: Russia. Currently, it’s snug in Kaliningrad, its westernmost port.“It’s an interesting thing in itself, how we haven’t seen a mass migration back there,” Hogan reckons. Despite being the biggest country on the planet, he says, Russia isn’t very easy to sail to, and it’s getting harder as war rages. It is, though, “something we’re watching closely.”They’re not the only ones. The race is on, and #YachtWatch is on the hunt.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: West calls for calm after Russian shelling starts fire at power plantUkraine accuses Russia of \u0026#39nuclear terrorism\u0026#39 after fire at power plant spreads panicWhat will life look for Roman Abramovich now?Friday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The How imposing martial law would enable Vladimir Putin to crush dissent in RussiaWhat nuclear weapons does Russia hold and how likely is Putin to use them?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"friday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: West calls for calm after Russian shelling starts fire at power plantUkraine accuses Russia of \u0026#39nuclear terrorism\u0026#39 after fire at power plant spreads panicWhat will life look for Roman Abramovich now?How imposing martial law would enable Vladimir Putin to crush dissent in RussiaWhat nuclear weapons does Russia hold and how likely is Putin to use them?Erdington: Labour holds seat in by-election with reduced majorityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brexiteer tory moans monstrous forms","story":"Brexiteer Tory moans about monstrous forms that Brit firms now have to fill inBusinesses have faced extra red tape on the trade since Brexit as the UK is no longer bound by the EUs rulesthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video brexit-tory-mp-questions-whether-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ImhST,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,mantisRecommender.hbEnabled:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,M.apiUrl:https:partner-widget-api-prod.tm-awx monitizer  compare prices gbp_en,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Former minister Sir Desmond Swayne moaned about the added bureaucracy caused by the UKaposs departure from the bloc in a fiery contribution in the Commons. Boris Johnson has repeatedly claimed he got Brexit done but there have been ongoing issues for firms caused by sweeping changes to trading rules. Businesses have faced extra red tape on the trade of goods and services since Brexit as the UK is no longer bound to the EU.Speaking in the Commons, Sir Demsond said: UK aid promoted trade in Africa by making borders seamless through digitising all the administrative processes.  Is that on our agenda for trade with the EU at all  Itaposs monstrous that weaposre filling in forms. Trade minister Mike Freer replied: We aim to have the best border in place by . SNP Business spokesperson Stephen Flynn told the Mirror: While itaposs good to finally see some Tories wake up to the reality of their own disastrous Brexit, it would be betterthey channelled their anger into pushing their bosses for support for businesses – which are struggling in the face of a Tory cost-of-living crisis and the long-term economic damage caused by Brexit.” Sir Desmond, a staunch Brexiteer, once appeared to fall asleep in the Commons when Tory grandee Ken Clarke gave a speech attacking the Governmentaposs Brexit legislation. He later blamed an early morning swim in the Serpentine for his lack of attention. Sir Desmond previously raised eyebrows when he suggested voters should be able to elect racists and misogyniststhey wanted to.The New Forest West West MP, who previously “blacked up” as soul singer James Brown for a fancy dress party, told the Commons last year that he hoped his constituents would never elect a racist or a misogynist - but he defended their right to do so.Speaking during a debate triggered by Boris Johnsonaposs attempts to rip up sleaze rules, he said: The principle of democracy is undermined by the requirement that we may be required to subscribe to behaviours to promote certain attitudes. I hope that my constituents never elect a racist or a misogynist, but they have a right to do so. At the time, a Downing Street spokesman said the PM had not seen the comments but said Mr Johnson had made it clear that there was no place for racism whatsoever in our society and that remains his position.

Lord Agnew lashed out at £bn Bounce Back Loans six weeks after he resigned in protest over “schoolboy errors” in the scheme. Around .million firms obtained the loans of up to £, or a quarter of annual turnover, the vast majority of them small businesses. But the government has estimated £.bn of loans were fraudulent and £bn won’t be repaid, according to the National Audit Office. The loans - which closed for applications last March - had no fees or interest for a year, followed by a .% interest rate after  months. Former Treasury minister Lord Agnew admitted it was a “complete pandemic of fraud”.  He told the Lords Digital Fraud Committee: “I donapost want to go back and try and be Captain Hindsight here… but there are still bits of data which would help us tackle this.” He added: There are hundreds of anecdotal examples of directors of these companies taking the money out of the business, putting it in their private bank accounts and going off and buying a sports car. “Now that is a fraud. That is against the purpose of the loan. “The banks will have the data on it. They know exactly where the money moves and when it moves, so can we please see the data and what they are doing about it ” He added: “The same applied to money that left the country. “How much of that £bn hit the British banking system and then left overseas within X weeks and months  “I mean, I sent letters of congratulations to Border Force staff who picked up suitcases of cash leaving the country. Literally.” He added a large sum, “let’s say £bn”, went directly back to banks to plug their own balance sheets. Lord Agnew called for a data dashboard to oversee what happened to the money. In December the National Audit Office said Tory ministers “failed to put adequate fraud prevention measures in place” when setting up the scheme. A national investigation team had received , reports of possible fraud by October, but only had capacity to pursue  cases a year. It has been set a target of clawing back “at least £m” over three years - .% of the total handed out in Bounce Back loans. By October there had been  arrests across  investigations and more than £m of recoveries.

Brave reporters do their best to cover the conflict but restrictions mean we do not know the full extent of atrocities being committed.

For that to happen his deeds must match his words.  What an insult Gavin Williamson, a joke when Defence Secretary, went on to become the worst Education Secretary in living memory. His reward for failure and incompetence is to be made a knight of the realm. Bestowing such a title on someone so undeserving debases the honours system. It should be there to pay tribute to those who have made a dference to this country through artistic and sporting achievements, service to others or voluntary or charity work. Boris Johnson is using it to buy political favours and keep his mates onside. Williamson’s knighthood dishonours those who deserve the accolade and insults the children he failed as Education Secretary.

The result reflects the world’s horror at the illegal actions of Vladimir Putin which has led to the slaughter of countless innocent lives.The words of condemnation must now be matched by a further tightening of the screw on Russian business and finance. The UK Government has acted swtly in cutting off banks and banning Russian planes from our airspace but has lagged behind the US and the EU in imposing other sanctions. Unlike Brussels we have still to freeze the assets of the members of the Russian Parliament. Dozens of Putin’s cronies and high-ranking military have yet to be targeted. The Tories have allowed London to become the world’s laundromat for Russian dirty money. They have also taken millions in donations from people with ties to the Kremlin. If they are serious about putting pressure on the Russian regime they should widen sanctions andthe donations. The longer they take to act, the more the suspicion grows that they are still in thrall to the oligarchs.  The best of us While Vladimir Putin has shown the worst of humanity with his brutal invasion, the public response to his vile actions has shown the best of humanity. Millions of people have donated to charities to help the people of Ukraine and the hundreds of thousands made homeless by the war. Some volunteers have even driven to the Polish-Ukrainian border to deliver much-needed medical supplies, food, clothes and toys for children. Their compassion has never been more necessary.

The Public Accounts Committeeblasted the Government for relying on national figures which mask signicant iation and challenges for inidual schools. Its new report raised signicant concerns that more deprived schools were “faring worse than wealthier schools under a shake-up of pupil funding. The result is unacceptable dferences in le chances for children.The PAC accused the Department for Education of having “little assurance” that £. billion of promised funding “will be enough to cover cost pressures including the impact of the COVID- pandemic”. It said ministers lacked understanding about why there was so much regional iation in school finances, with over % of state schools in deficit in  local authorities as of March . Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: DfEaposs airy assurances about the healthy books of academies in particular mask some cruel ides between the haves and have nots, unacceptable dferences in le chances for our children and young people from the get-go, through no fault of their own. But we see the departmentaposs apparent disregard for the inequalities exposed and exacerbated in the pandemic in the catchup provision debacle, and in all the children and their families still struggling, years after the promised review, with the poor provision for special educational needs and disabilities. Rather than the department blithely looking for laurels to rest on, it must grasp that itaposs not OK for any group of our children to be abandoned in the system that it oversees.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: It is not only the Public Accounts Committee that is frustrated by the Department for Educationaposs blithe insistence that schools have never had it so good.So are school leaders, who have to live with the reality of severely straitened budgets. Shadow Schools Minister Stephen Morgan said childrenaposs education had been damaged by a decade of Tory rule. He said: “Ministers are increasingly demanding school leaders do more with less and it’s narrowing childrenaposs opportunities, hitting those in poorer communities hardest.A Department for Education spokesperson said: Investment in schools is rising – we have confirmed an overall £.bn increase to the core school budget by - and will continue to deliver year on year, real terms per pupil increases, including a % real terms per pupil boost in -.“Schools across the country continue to have high standards of financial management and governance, with the latest published data showing that .% of academy trusts and .% of maintained schools have balanced accounts.

Ukraine will prove the fatal, final mistake by a fascistic gangster who egotistically believed his own invincible propaganda after strategic triumphs in Crimea and Syria, and the  Trump and Brexit blows delivered to the US and UK. Vlad the Invader’s twitchy finger on the nuclear trigger and the offer of Potemkin negotiations are both signs even he fears this is an impending personal Armageddon. This is fuelled by brave Ukrainians fighting heroically and Russians courageously protesting “No to War”, which is inspiring resistance around the world. Supplying anti-tank, helicopter and aircraft missiles strengthens defenders and weakens attackers already suffering punishing losses. Britain, the rest of Europe and the US finally uniting over economic and cultural sanctions will eventually bankrupt the Putin machine and perhaps drive a deep wedge between the tyrant and his billionaire cronies who enjoy opulent luxury wherever they please.  And China abstaining instead of vetoing a UN Security Council motion by the US condemning the brutal invasion emphasised Putin’s isolation, as a new ally quickly distanced itself from an ageing, deranged dictator. The bloody conflict could still belong: reducing Ukrainian neighbourhoods to rubble, inflicting unbearable heartache and costing countless lives. What is becoming clearer, however, is that Putin is also likely to be one of the victims. But let’s not buy charlatan Boris Johnson’s propaganda that he is suddenly an international statesman, a Prime Minister orchestrating the resistance. Johnson let Putin walk all over him and Britain, with oligarchs smirking unconcerned whenever ruling Conservatives, reliant on Russian-linked money, talked tough then acted soft.Charismatic, cool-headed, defiant Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky is what a real leader looks and sounds like. Germany’s centre-Left Olaf Scholz is also rising to the occasion, standing up to Putin at considerable financial expense. A European Union that Johnson ripped Britain from as part of a career move was firmer on sanctions until shamed Johnson started running to catch up. Locking out Ukrainian refugees fleeing terror unless they apply to be fruit pickers is disgraceful and inhuman, when Poland, Romania and Hungary open their borders. Why not seize the spacious British properties of Russian oligarchs to house Putin’s casualties  I’ve watched and known Johnson for longer than the  years Putin has misruled Russia. So I’m aware of the cynicism of the great charlatan. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  The first casualty of war is Partygate, with Johnson relieved that the shells and missiles are effectively providing a smokescreen. If he’s hit by a fine, the PM will pray it is today. Now wouldn’t be the moment to remove a lawbreaker in Downing Street, his apologists will argue. They’d be wrong, of course. Chamberlain was dumped by MPs to be replaced by Churchill during the Second World War then, before Japan finally surrendered, the country swapped Churchill for Attlee. Labour leader Keir Starmer will inevitably receive less airtime than the PM but should have calculated that he must be constructively critical rather than mercilessly pummelling the Tory rogue. War in Europe might save Johnsonnot an invaded country or Putin.

The RSPCA said its intake of bunnies has increased by a third with nearly  taken in last year, compared to  in .Vanessa Cunningham, director of care  veterinary Services at Wood Green, The Animals Charity, told how hers and other shelters are also at full capacity after seeing nearly a % increase. “Rabbits have been the most neglected pet species in the UK for many years, which has only been exacerbated by the overwhelming volume of rabbits that were bred and purchased during the pandemic,” she said.  “Many owners have now realised how much space and hard work rabbits require, or things have gotten out of controlthey inadvertently brought home an un-neutered male and female pair who began breeding.”There are an estimated , rabbits kept as pets in the UK. Google searches for ‘Rabbits for sale’ rose from , in April  to , in April .

RSPCA rabbit welfare expert Dr Jane Tyson said: “Despite rabbits often being perceived as an ideal ‘starter pet’, they actually have very complex needs and are one of the most neglected pets in Britain. “They also have long le spans of around - years so are a big commitment for a family. “It means sadly the RSPCA deals with many calls about bunnies where they have been neglected or abandoned each year.  “When rabbits are bought on impulse, an owner may not realise how complex they are to care for and what a commitment caring for rabbits can be. “Whilst they can be hugely rewarding pets full of personality, they also need lots of stimulation and - crucially - space to ensure their welfare needs are being met.” The RSPCA says that anyone who has done their research and is certain they can provide the time, space, money and care, to please consider adopting one of the many rescue rabbits in need of a home instead of buying.  These include Storm and Betty are a pair of bonded rabbits who have been looking for a home at Great Ayton Animal Centre near Middlesbrough for two months.

Privacy-loving Rosie and Christopher Taylor-Davies have lost a High Court battle after the roof extension Simon Cook built sparked complaints from the husband and we.They claim they have been forced to live in darkness with the curtains drawn after neighbour installed a Velux window facing directly into their bedroom from his substantial home next door. Mr Cook was not a party to the case, which was an attempt by judicial review by Mr and Mrs Taylor-Davies to get the council to take action against him. The couple said the fact the window did not use frosted glass meant they had to resort to getting undressed behind a bookcase, the only point on their top floor where they could not be seen from his new window.  And to add insult to injury, married dad Mr Cook installed a blonde mannequin dummy in the window, making it appear that it was watching over their home. At the High Court, a senior judge said it showed Mr Cook did not take his neighboursapos privacy concerns seriously, but ruled that he had not breached planning rules by installing an openable window with clear glass. The court heard Mr Cook had applied for planning permission for the rooflight and a dormer beside it as part of extensive works to his home, in Dover House Road, close to Richmond Park, in . The work involved a roof extension with dormer windows on both sides and at the back, but Mr and Mrs Taylor-Davies objected to elements of the project, calling the windows an invasion of their privacy. The Velux directly overlooks our bed, they said, claiming that they would be overlooked day and night on their top floor, where they sleep and shower, and Mrs Taylor-Davies studies for her PhD in embroidery.  In February , the local council, London Borough of Wandsworth, gave Mr Cook planning permission for his extension, but laid down conditions that the dormer window should have obscured glass and be non-opening. However, council planning officers waived those rules for the Velux, because it faces the sky and would have less impact on neighbours. Challenging the councilaposs decision not to take enforcement action to make Mr Cook obscure the rooflight glass, their barrister Stephen Whale argued before High Court judge, Mrs Justice Lang, that the window had robbed them of their privacy. The neighbouring houses are on a slope so that Mr Cookaposs is higher than theirs, meaning that anyone looking out of the rooflight would be able to see directly into the Taylor-Daviesapos top floor, including a clear-sided shower box. But despite knowing of their concerns, their neighbour had added insult to injury by sometimes positioning a blonde mannequin in the window, facing out onto their property, he continued. It serves to give the impression, as presumably he intends, that there is a person at the window overlooking their property and invading their privacy, he told the court. It only adds to their distress. The overlooking of their property and the invasion of their privacy as a result of the Velux window is very distressing to them.There is no good reason for the Velux window to have clear glass or be openable as there is another window very close on the opposite wall. There would be no loss of amenity to Mr Cook were the Velux window to have opaque glass and be non-openable. The only thing the Velux window overlooks is the top floor of the claimantsapos house. The barrister said the council had been wrong in refusing to take enforcement action against Mr Cook in relation to the window. Giving judgment, Mrs Justice Lang said: Mr Cook periodically installs a mannequin in the roof light which gives the impression that there is a person at the window looking out at [the claimantsapos home]. This suggests to me that he is not taking the claimantsapos concerns seriously, and so he is unlikely to maintain obscuring film voluntarily. But she said there was nothing in the planning conditions obliging him to obscure the rooflightaposs glass. They only required Mr Cook to obscure his new dormer window, she said. She also noted that Mr Cook had added an obscuring film to part of the rooflight, although adding that it could easily be removed. The couple, both New Zealanders, moved into their home beside Richmond Park  years ago and raised a family there.Mrs Taylor-Davies, , is a costume designer, who has worked in TV, film and theatre, as well as winning a local council award for her campaign to make protective scrubs for medics during the Covid- pandemic.Her husband, Mr Taylor-Davies, , is a technical consultant and software designer. Speaking from his home after the court hearing, Mr Taylor-Davies said the mannequin is no longer at her station by the window. Weaposve lived here for more than  years, but we might have to move out because of all this, he explained. We canapost take a shower or get dressed without being overlooked, he said, adding that their only option was to keep the curtains drawn. Itaposs essentially like living in darkness, he said.

Sean Williams wrote: It has double yellow on both side  What are they expected go down there  Chris Steele quipped: Good job they’ve put double yellows there.  And Rachel Ashley had this suggestion: Whoever put the yellow lines there, it needs to be a red route. Some drivers not familiar with Hanley’s roads have nearly been caught out by their sat-navs which have directed them to turn up the street. The Taxpayersapos Alliance has previously dubbed the lines as aposan unnecessary use of resourcesapos. Chief executive John OaposConnell told StokeonTrentLive in : “Anyone with commonsense can see that this was probably an unnecessary use of resources.  “Council tax is a huge bill for families and they wonapost be pleased to see it spent in this way.apos But at the time Stoke-on-Trent City Councilaposs highways department defended the double yellow lines on Bird Cage Walk which were put there around  years ago. Councillor Daniel Jellyman, cabinet member for regeneration, transport and heritage, said: “These double yellow lines were put down around the turn of the century. When they weren’t there, people actually parked on the road and left items there. The lane is clearly not accessible all the way along to most cars, but it is accessible some of the way and motorbikes, scooters and service vehicles can and do gain access to the entire . “If only one side of the road had double yellow lines, there would be nothing to stop a motorbike, for example, parking on the other side effectively blocking the public highway. “Although they might look a bit peculiar at first glance, experience has taught us that these restrictions are necessary.

Grace, , frantically fought to have her pet released back to her after being informed of the drastic decision five days in but ultimately felt powerless to stop it. Battersea said staff had concerns about Bearaposs behaviour during his brief time in its kennels and allegedly explained they didnapost have the time or resources needed to train him properly to a satisfactory level. Itaposs understood the dog did not bite or attack any people or animals while at the charity.Have you had a similar experience  Let us know at webnews@mirror It’s not what I wanted to do in the slightest but I physically had no other option, Grace told the Mirror, explaining why she gave him up. It’s gut-wrenching that I put my trust in a place that’s very well known and I have never heard a bad thing about Battersea until now. Within five days they’ve completely ruined a potential le. Bear had another  yearsnot more, and they’ve taken that away from him. During a routine inspection, months after the family adopted Bear, their landlord decided he could no longer stay at the property, classing him as a security dog, despite him being a regular pet. Grace, from Cambridgeshire, had looked at moving out so she could keep Bear but said she couldnapost afford anywhere  that allowed pets.After failing to persuade her landlord to re-consider and being unable to find a suitable adopter, she heavy-heartedly opted to move him to Battersea on January . On January  she was informed he would be put to sleep and he died on January . Grace said she understood Bear was a victim of abuse prior to her adopting him and would often get scared and bark at strangers. Dog behaviourist Blake Clark had one session with him when the family originally took him in and told the Mirror he was anxious but not remotely dangerous.Referring to how quickly a decision was made about Bear, Blake said heaposs worried it is a common thing.He believes staff possibly misunderstood Bearaposs initial reactiveness for aggression and the dog may have then simply become the victim of atick box exercise. For me, they didn’t understand behaviour for this to happen. For me, something’s gone massively wrong, he said. Grace said when she fought against the decision she was told they donapost have the time or resources to give Bear the amount of kennel training he needed, which she said rings alarm bells. She explained on signing him over Battersea assured her putting a dog down was a last resort and they have an unlimited time [for] training them.Basically, all the promises they’d made to me that he would have plenty of time, they didn’t give him that all, she said. Grace believes part of the issue was Bearaposs breed despite the charity assuring her during the intake process they donapost discriminate. They told me they didn’t get chance to do an assessment with him...so I don’t understand [how] in five days they’ve come to that conclusion. In an email the day after he arrived - seen by the Mirror - Grace says a staff member told her Bear was nervous but they would do everything they could to help him. Grace described Bear as very jumpy and he took a while to settle when faced with new people or in new environments. But that he was an amazing, kind, beautul, gentle dog. I have seizures and he was actually alerting me when I was going to have a seizure. He would go and get someone  to help orno one was around he would keep me safe, she said. Due to Bear being legally the property of Battersea once signed over, Grace and Blake claim they found it almost impossible to come to a compromise. Blake - a dog behaviourist for  years - offered to adopt Bear himself, or even travel down to London regularly to train him for free, but said he kept being met with barriers until it was too late. Grace said she was told releasing him would be dficult due to restrictions imposed - but they did not elaborate. It was very backwards and forwards about their policies, she said. In the email telling Grace the dog would be put to sleep - also seen by the Mirror - a member of staff referred to signicant concerns about Bearaposs behaviour. They said when attempting to take him out of his kennel to a secure exercise area he displayed strong reactions to staff on-site from a distance as well as dogs - but failed to give any specics.  The email went on to say in the following days he continued to display concerning reactions, which included growling and dficulty in recovering from those reactions even in low pressure situations and environments. It added the behaviour and kennel management teams discussed the issues and having considered all the options available to us we have come to the dficult decision to put Bear to sleep. Blake said some dogs are too far gone to be helped due to too much trauma and cannot overcome their aggressive behaviour - but doesnapost believe Bear was in that category. There’s a dference between reactive and aggressive. He was reactive in a sense that he would bark a lot and sometimes lunge but he has never bitten anyone before or during his time at Battersea, he said, having spoken to staff there. But on attempting to find out more about Bearaposs brief spell at the charity, he was allegedly told it was a data protection issue.Grace went on to say, when she dropped Bear off at Battersea, he barked at a behaviourist and they said donapost let him near me, take him back, dashing out of the room after a few seconds. She said staff then told her to walk Bear to his kennel herself. The day after Battersea informed her Bear would be put to sleep she was told heaposd been moved to a aposcaution kennelapos away from other dogs and was no longer allowed out for his daily exercise or other activities. I feel that when I took him down to the kennels they’d already made their mind up about what they were going to do, Grace said. When Grace requested she be given his ashes she was told that it is not something they normally do as they conduct multiple cremations at a time. Grace said: I got Bear after a very hard time for myself, so me and him were very attached - we had an amazing bond. You feel as though they are your child and I’ve let him down. Blake said he believes there needs to be big changes going forward across the rescue sector. I think rescues need to take time, obviously, maybe change the environment of a kennel because essentially kennels haven’t really changed in the last  years. He said they must do more to mimic the home environment so dogs feel at ease and have a fair chance, while those thinking of adopting puppies must first understand the work and patience needed. A spokesperson for Battersea said: There is no maximumof stay for any animal in our care. Our staff work with every animal to understand whether any problem behaviours can be resolved with time, training and care, and are determined to achieve a positive outcome. Regrettably, despite our best efforts working with Bear, he did not show signs of improvement and his signs of aggression towards people and other dogs increased. When a dog in our care shows signs of stress in kennels, we will consider every option available, including the possibility of sending a dog to stay in a foster home. Unfortunately, this option was not possible for Bear due to the worrying behaviour he consistently displayed around new people. They said a contact of Graceaposs visited Battersea and offered to foster him but the team felt it would not be responsible of them to allow it. The spokesperson said it was agreed Grace could reclaim himshe agreed to seek behavioural advice from an expert and take precautions. After two days considering her decision, Bear’s owner informed us that she would not be able to take him back and staff explained that Bear would be put to sleep as previously discussed. His owner agreed that this should happen as soon as possible. Grace said she only finally agreed after their decision email was sent because she felt pressured as her landlord would not budge and she was worried about Bearaposs quality of le in the aposcaution kennelapos. The spokesperson said the percentage of dogs in the charityaposs care put to sleep in  was  percent, compared to  the year before. However, they failed to provide a full breakdown. They also did not provide any specics regarding Bearaposs worrying behaviour or exactly what their policies are which would support opting to put a dog to sleep within five days.

Kate has teamed up with her stepmother-in-law Camilla to launch a new childrenaposs book club on the Duchess of Cornwallaposs Reading Room website, which has also just launched.To mark the occasion she told of her favourite childrenaposs books - including one that features a character that shares the same name as Princess Charlotte. Among Kateaposs recommendations is Charlotteaposs Web, which she says is loved in our house for obvious reasons and describes it as a charming story about friendship, loyalty and love.  Another is Stig of the Dump, which Kate reveals was recommended to her by her dad Michael and says resonates with her as she loved spending time outdoors, making dens, digging, discovering and making things out of odds and ends as a child. Kate also recommends the Katie Morag Series by Mairi Hedderwick, which she describes as captivating as well as the book Feelings, which she says is a wonderful way to help children understand and recognise their feelings and emotions.

Click here to sign up .The final book on the list is The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark, which Kate says is a comforting story to help children face their fears and grow in confidence with the help of others.Kate is already known to be a fan of this book, as last month she read it when she appeared on CBeebies Bedtime Stories.  The book, by Jill Tomlinson, tells the story of baby barn owl Plop, who is helped by others to grow in confidence and overcome his fears. At the end of the reading, she added: “Wow, what an encouraging tale. “We can all feel scared sometimes just like our little owl friend Plop, but as Mrs Barn Own said, ‘It’s better to find out about the things that scare us before we make up our mind’. “And with the help of others, we can often face things that worry us. Now it’s time for bed. Night night and sleep tight.”Meanwhile, Camilla has long been an advocate of literacy and reading and last week exclusively wrote in the Mirror about the books she likes reading to her grandchildren.Among them is Gangster Granny - a story about a grandmother who plots to steal the Queen’s Crown Jewels from The Tower of London.

However, it seems a lot of thought actually goes into what Kate wears and she sometimes sends secret messages with her choices.And it appears when she and Prince William visited Wales earlier this week, she made a special effort with her earrings. The earrings were simple gold hoops that stood out against her bouncy, voluminous hair.  And it turns out they paid tribute to the place she was visiting - Wales - as they were made by a small Welsh jewellery brand called Spells of Love. The brand was founded by Hayley Jones, who runs the company with just her sister-in-law, and says each of her pieces is designed and ethically crafted with love and intention.

She told the Mirror: It was so lovely to see Her Royal Highness wearing them, it still feels very surreal!  I called my mum straight away, who then called all my family. It was incredibly exciting. She looked beautul and I am honoured to have Her Royal Highness wear our design. And not only was it a boost for Hayley, but she also says the impact itaposs had on her business has been amazing, with the earrings selling out within a day. She added: As a small business it has really helped put my company on the map. I have received orders from countries I would never have expected would ever know about my brand. It has helped my business immensely, Iaposm so grateful and honoured to have Her Royal Highness wear a design. Kate and William visited Wales in order to mark St Davidaposs Day - St David is the patron saint of Wales.During the trip, they learned about the importance of the agricultural industry for rural communities and how they celebrate the history of local regions.

Michael decided to take out a funeral plan with the Hull-based Heavenly Services after friends recommended the company to him,GrimsbyLive reports .But the company fell into financial trouble in October following the sudden death of its founder and director Simon Woolston with branches in Hull, Bradford, Leeds, Scunthorpe, Grimsby and Bridlington forced to close.  Michael, , said he paid £, into the funeral service plan on Wednesday, June  last year, which included a cremation and for his ashes to be ed to his family. He said he has tried to get a refund from Heavenly Services but was told that because he paid in cash, he would be unable to recover the amount. Michael told Grimsby Live: I feel sick to death. I didnapost want a big fuss and just wanted to sort out my funeral. I can no longer afford my own funeral now because I donapost have that sort of money to put by now. That was everything I had. I have no-one to bury me or burn me. I have absolutely nothing. I suffer badly with anxiety and depression. Iaposm on medication three times a day just to keep me under control. They have left me with nothing but sadness and pain. Iaposve had to accept it because I have no choice. Michael is taking care of his mother who is seriously ill after having two strokes and developing Parkinsonaposs disease. The added stress has taken its toll on him and his -year-old mother. He said: Every time I see my mum, I just tell her that I donapost know whataposs happened. I donapost want to add any worry to her on top of what sheaposs already going through.  Mum suffers badly with health issues now along with a couple of strokes. Iaposm with her three times a day to make sure sheaposs cared for. She doesnapost need this added stress either. Itaposs so dficult because I donapost want to be that person who has a pauperaposs funeral because of this funeral service that has left me in the lurch. Itaposs just not right and now I canapost afford to be buried. Michael is just one of many customers struggling to get funeral money repaid.Bernard Skerrett, , died in October having contracted Covid- as well as suffering from Parkinson’s and an asbestos-related disease.Nikki McLoughlin, Bernardaposs daughter, told Hull Live that her parents had arranged cremation plans back in . After her father had passed away in October, a woman from Heavenly Services told her they were to aposcease trading with all the assets being frozenapos. The woman then suggested Nikki should find new funeral directors. An elderly couple said in October they were left in limbo and feared they could lose £, after paying up front for two cremation plans through Heavenly Services. The couple –  and  years old – said they had not heard what is happening with their cremation plan and whether they would get a refund. An insolvency firm last week all but confirmed to Hull Live that customers will not get their money back. Letters were sent out by insolvency firm Auker Rhodes informing customers Heavenly Services was to enter liquidation. Auker Rhodes said all company assets would be recovered and sold for the benefit of creditors. Humberside Police started an investigation in November after confirming they had received complaints from customers who had been affected by Heavenly Services.They told reporters today that their aposinvestigation into these reports continuesapos.

IMDb to the rescue! It was Meghan Markle! Not only that, it was ironically a fairytale themed episode, and in her first scene she was dressed as a princess. I think Castle would describe Meghan Markle being in the episode based on fairytale characters princesses a bit ironic, said a third viewer.

Dan was enjoying a cup of tea at his open patio door at around pm when he was shocked to see a “big, round light” floating in the sky, Cornwall Live reports.He claims the object, which appeared much bigger to the naked eye, moved “faster than any satellite” and changed direction in a way that defied physics. “It looked like it was on fire,” Dan said, “But there’s no way it was a meteor or anything. It changed direction, horizontally in front of me then changed direction again out to see.  “I was just hypnotised, staring at it wondering, what the hell. “Then I went to get my phone, which took me about  seconds,” and by the time I got it out I could only get three small lots of footage. “I thought: ‘that’s some sort of weird bloody spacecraft.’” Dan said it appeared much larger to the naked eye than his video and images look. He also explained that the floating object moved around “very quickly,” much more so than any boat, plane or satellite.“I couldn’t get my head around it,” he continued, “It just looked like the bloody sun. It was huge. “Whatever it was, could have better technology, might have been in space going the speed of light. I wouldn’t bother it. “Never seen anything like it in my le.” Photos taken of the orb show it to be orange, slightly distorted-looking, and video footage taken by Dan shows it looking to be moving across the sky.  Askedhe’d ever seen what he thought to be a UFO before, Dan said: “There was one thing, actually, about  years ago, it was around here too- with my mate in a field.“It was winter, there was definitely a spacecraft. “I’ll admit we did have a smoke, and I said ‘Ollie look at that’. Went up and down, doing a triangle. Then it just went woosh away.” Dan said he felt sympathy for people who spot these sightings because they often get mocked on social media. However, he insisted that people who leave such comments would change their mindthey saw something like what he did.

Norovirus is highly contagious and causes vomiting and diarrhoea, but normally does not last much more than a couple of days.The virus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools where tiny particles of vomit or excrement enters a persons nose or mouth.The advice comes after routine surveillance in England shows that the number of outbreaks caused by the vomiting bug has increased in recent weeks.  From the four week period from end January to February, numbers are on the increase in educational settings and in care homes. Norovirus is highly infectious and causes vomiting and diarrhoea but usually passes in a couple of days. It is easily transmitted through contact with infected iniduals or contaminated surfaces. The increase in reported outbreaks was initially in educational settings, particularly in nursery and childcare facilities, with % more incidents reported to UKHSA than would be expected. Reports of norovirus outbreaks in care home settings have also increased in recent weeks, with a rise from  reported in week to  reported in week of .  While outbreaks reported in care home settings overall remain below pre-pandemic expected levels, it is likely they will continue to increase in the coming weeks, they say. Professor Saheer Gharbia, Gastrointestinal Pathogens  Food Safety Directorate, UKHSA, said: Norovirus, commonly known as the winter vomiting bug, has been at lower levels than normal throughout the pandemic but as people have begun to mix more, the numbers of outbreaks have started to increase again. Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs.The six main symptoms Vomiting Watery diarrhoea Feeling sick Aching arms and legs A high temperature A headache How to reduce the spread of norovirus:Stay at homeyou are experiencing norovirus symptoms, the UK Health Security Agency say. Do notto work or send children to school until  hours after symptoms have cleared. Also avoid visiting elderly or poorly relatives, particularlythey are in hospital or a care home. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and warm water. Alcohol hand gels don’t kill norovirus. When an infected person vomits, the droplets contaminate the surrounding surfaces. A bleach-based household cleaner or a combination of bleach and hot water should be used to disinfect potentially contaminated household surfaces and commonly used objects such as toilets, taps, telephones, door handles and kitchen surfaces. If you are ill, avoid cooking and helping prepare meals for others until  hours after symptoms have stopped, as norovirus can be spread through food contaminated by the virus when food is handled by symptomatic people infected iniduals. Wash any contaminated clothing or bedding using detergent and at °C, andpossible, wear disposable gloves to handle contaminated items. What to doyou have norovirus You are required to isolate by yourself at home until  hours have passed since the last time you were sick, doctors say.The NHS warned: “Stay off school or work until you have not been sick or had diarrhoea for at least  days.This is when youaposre most infectious. “Do not visit hospitals or care homes during this time.” The virus can survive outside the body for several days on contaminated food and so it is important for people to wash their hands regularly, especially before eating. People are most infectious from when symptoms start until  hours after all symptoms have passed. You may also be infectious for a short time before and after this.

He currently attends St Thomasaposs Battersea alongside his younger sister Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis is also expected to enrol there later this year.And according to one royal expert, Georgeaposs rumoured school move could be down to a Royal Family tradition.Royal author Duncan Larcombe told OK! that itaposs actually unusual for royal children to all get their education at the same school. He explained: William and Harry broke the mould by going to the same school, butyou look at the Queenaposs children, they were all schooled separately. And, of course, William and Harry wouldnapost have gone to the same schoolone of them was a girl. Kate had a traditional co-ed education but it seems to be almost par for the course with the royals that they donapost pile all of their children into the same school.

Among the schools said to be in the running for Prince George is Lambrook - a co-education school near Ascot.Other schools they have reportedly looked at are Ludgrove Prep, St Andrews Pangbourne and Papplewick.  A source told the Daily Mail : Itaposs an open secret the Cambridges are looking to settle in Berkshire and George is set to leave Thomasaposs this summer, unless circumstances suddenly change.Itaposs the talk of the county and they will, of course, be made extremely welcome. aposThey always put their children front and centre of everything they do, so finding the right school has been a priority.

Putin raised the awful spectre of nuclear confrontation because he’s losing, or at least not winning as easily as he expected. His calamitous miscalculation in invading Ukraine is backfiring badly now, and the world is uniting against him. He faces a battle at home too, as anti-war protests swell in Moscow and other cities. The pressure on Putin must be intensied, never relaxed, until he has withdrawn the last of his forces from the country he attacked.  And then he must face judgement. He must be held to account for an unforgivable assault that will cost many lives on both sides, including civilians. Many more are being forced to flee their homes in terror. Britain has sent military equipment and is picking up speed on sanctions but much more can be done to help Ukraine. Oligarchs close to Putin must be pursued relentlessly.

Cleo McNally, , wrestled an officer for their baton during the rampage, it was also said in court. Police were dealing with another incident nearby when they were approached by a group of youths, including McNally.The -year-old was trying to start a fight with her friend and was heard swearing and shouting during the incident on November  of last year,Manchester Evening News reports.One of the officers asked her to stop swearing, at which she replied: “Don’t care, she’s a f***** little b***h” and “Do you think I actually care - she is a s**g”. The officer explained that children and elderly people were close and could hear her and again told her to stop swearing. She refused and then got close to the officer shouting abuse at the girl who was standing behind her, Stockport Magistrates Court heard.“She could see the defendant’s hand on her baton and pushed her hand back, and told her to go home,” Jeffrey Bird prosecuting said. “The defendant said: aposno, you f***** go homeapos and pushed her backwards. The officer tried to apprehend the defendant and gained control of her on the floor. “A struggle then ensued, and the officer had to be assisted by two other officers.” McNally, of Danes Square, Macclesfield, continued to resist and kicked out at all three police officers on Castle Street, Macclesfield. One was kicked to the wrist and knee, and the others were kicked to the knees. She was then arrested and taken for a police interview, in which she told officers she had been in an argument with her friend after drinking a full bottle of vodka. McNally said she remembered the police arriving but didn’t recall putting her hand on the officer’s baton - but did remember pushing them. She said she was ‘incredibly drunk’. The court heard she had one previous conviction for racially aggravated harassment when she was a youth. “She said in the midst of it, she did kick the officer but it wasn’t intentional,” Lesley Herman, defending, said. She is remorseful. There were no injuries - I don’t think the officers had any bruising.” McNally arrived almost two hours late to the afternoon hearing on Wednesday , and told Stockport JPs she believed the case was due to be heard the next day instead. “She was very concerned about being in court, she genuinely thought it would be heard tomorrow at am,” Ms Herman said. “Speaking of the offence, she was arguing with her friend, they were not involved in the other incident. They are still friends. She says, as a result of the incident, she is too scared to drink.” After berating her for being late and keeping the court waiting, JP Dominic Stone said: “You are going to have to learn to respect people in authority. “A police officer is there to serve and protect the whole community, including you. They show you courtesy, the least you can show to them is courtesy in . “This is going to land you in serious consequences.

Lily Nova, , from St Louis, Missouri, US, says she had her first encounter at the end of  after taking up astrophotography to cure lockdown boredom.But the encounters did not stop there, with Lily now claiming the extraterrestrial beings visit her on a daily basis. Theyaposve approached her in all manner of spacecraft, including metallic ships, black triangles and orbs that move in an unearthly way, she claims. She also says she knows what some of the beings look like.  She first started getting into astrophotography in the summer of  during the lockdown which eventually led to her first encounter with aliens just a few months later, in November. She said: My first encounter with aliens and UFOs was very intense. I went outside for some fresh air one night and I immediately locked eyes with bright light hovering over the neighbourhood.I started investigating and realised it was a UFO. Seconds later I looked away briefly and when I looked back there was a second craft that was much closer.I could actually see the triangular shape of the craft. The UFOs did some impressive manoeuvres to show me that it wasnapost a regular aircraft before they disappeared above me. It really spooked me because aliens and UFOs arenapost something I have thought about much before. It was a total reality shting experience.A couple of months later I had my second encounter. After that, it kept happening more frequently and now I am having experiences daily. During my encounters I have also been able to see what the beings look like. One of the first beings I saw was a girl with light blue skin. She had no hair, but she was very beautul. She was wearing a skin tight grey suit and I saw her ship mates standing behind her in the same unorm. I have also seen another group of beings with light blonde hair, fair and glowing skin and bright blue eyes. I believe they send images of themselves to me through telepathy. I think they are easing me into an introduction as it would be such a shocking experience for any human to have an alien walk up to you. Lily believes that the aliens were testing the waters with her after her first shocking encounter as she says they were motioning towards her and knew she was recording. She thinks that they then gave her some space to process the experience before appearing to her again.  Lily added: My encounters have been very close from the start. I could not believe what I was seeing, it was groundbreaking and it piqued my interest in astrophotography even more. I needed to find out as much as possible. I abandoned my career as a nutritionist because it was overtaken by my passion for finding out more about UFOs and aliens. Itaposs not something I ever expected to happen.The shock of my encounters with the UFOs eventually turned to comfort as I had more and more experiences.It felt like I was developing a relationship with them.These experiences have changed everything for me. It has totally changed my view of the world and I have learnt so much about the cosmos and other beings. I have been focusing on spreading awareness of what I have found. Lily now believes that she can invite these experiences with aliens and UFOs when is she is in a relaxed, open and blissful state of mind. She says that she has even developed a sixth sense and intuitive gut feeling for when they are going to appear to her. Lily added: Whenever I am out doing my creative passion, astrophotography, this is when I believe I can make contact and invite these encounters. During my first initiated contact, where I have invited them instead of them just showing up, I even received a vision of being on the space ship and of the ships crew members. I have been out with a friend who is experienced in meditation, and we set our intention for them to appear to us, and within five minutes of getting out the car, a bright golden orb appears and was moving around to our questions. Since the shock wore off, I just feel joy, love and peace. They are such beautul and positive experiences, sometimes I even ball my eyes out crying while itaposs happening. I believe that they come to me because I believe in them, I am open-minded and I am welcoming towards them. It has been fascinating to learn about the universe and to create the incredible connection that has been formed.

I guess we’ll never know! “It is starting to fade now and we’re sure she’ll be back to her wonderful white colouring soon. “But we loved her golden paws so much that we decided to name her Marigold as it looks like she’s got her gloves on for a spring clean.” The “sweet but sensitive” pooch is looking for a quiet home with patient owners who can give her lots of time and space so she can settle into her new le. Rachel added: “As Marigold was a stray we know very little about her and we don’t believe she’s lived in a home before. “So she’ll need owners who can give her time to settle. “She can find meeting new people quite scary but eventually builds up the courage to say ‘hello’. “Once she gets to know you and trusts you she enjoys attention. “When she first arrived she had no idea what to do with toys so we don’t think she’s ever had her own toys before. “But she’s learned to love squeakers and really enjoys a good game of fetch. “Marigold is such a sweetheart and we’re sure she’ll bloom in the right home. “If you can give her a chance, you’ll be rewarded with a loving companion to share your le with.” If youaposre interested in rehoming Marigold - or any other animals at Bath Cats and Dogs Home - contract their team on   or email them via rehoming@bcdh.org.uk.

Her babyaposs middle name is going to be after our Grandmother who died last year and that was my plan. Itaposs a situation where all I can think is what are the odds, she continued. Iaposve had my daughters name made up in my mind for the last few years and Iaposve never imagined naming my daughter anything  so I donapost even have a back-up. The woman is now nervous her sister will think sheaposs copied her and is concerned it will cause a whole load of drama, but sheaposs reluctant to change the name considering its one sheaposs wanted for a long time. The middle name Iaposm happy to change to something  but would you change the first name in my situation  she asked fellow Mumsnet users. One user replied: Itaposs not actually the same name . Personally I would keep the name but let my sister know soon about your long standing plan of Zara so it doesnapost come as a surprise further down the road. Iaposd keep it light and cheerful, but be clear you are letting her know and not asking for permission. Another added: In your situation I would be tempted to change the first name to something that doesnapost rhyme, like Zoe, but keep the middle name. All my male cousins on one side of the family have the same middle nameand itaposs a non issue. My mum actually wishes sheaposd given it to my brother too because heaposs the only one who doesnapost have it.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Natalia Reynolds, who is pregnant, nipped into one of the fast-food restaurants for a meal on Thursday, February , and ordered a Coke Zero.She drank it all and looked down into the cup, and to her shock she claims she saw maggots at the bottom, and now sheaposs been aposput offapos going to McDonaldaposs. Natalia, , said she took the offending cup back to the Rawclfe Road branch of the chain in Goole, East Riding of Yorkshire, and staff were left scratching their heads at what the brown worm-like shapes were. What do you think about the shocking discovery  Let us know in the comments...McDonaldaposs said the issue had been investigated and they aposdid not find any evidence of pest activityapos but said they were continuing to liaise with the customer so she couldthe aposforeign objectapos for further investigation. Natalia, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, said: I brought the food and drink home from McDonaldaposs, it wasnapost until later on in the evening until I noticed the maggots. I was collecting stuff to put in the bin and I picked up the empty cups, looked inside and I was like aposoh my God, thereaposs maggotsapos.  There were probably about four or five of them in there. I didnapost feel any go into my mouth or notice any dference in the flavour of the drink. I think the maggots were dead. I didnapost see any moving but this just makes me think they were in the ice. All I can think is that they were in the ice and the ice melted by the end, I definitely didnapost swallow any. When I looked into the cup and saw the maggots it was terrying. It was disgusting and it was awful. I was  weeks pregnant at the time [now  weeks pregnant] and it just made me extra concerned knowing Iaposd drunk this.  I went back to McDonaldaposs that night and said aposI found this in the drink, can you tell me what it is apos They couldnapost really give me an answer. They were disgusted as well but I didnapost get an apology or anything. All the members of staff came to have a look at the drink and basically looked at me in disgust asto say aposurgh, you drank that apos I was thinking aposyou should be apologising to meapos. There was no remorse or apology.  They did say aposcan we get you another drink apos but I said aposabsolutely notapos. The mum-to-be left the cup and its contents with the McDonaldaposs team and was told it had been sent off for examination - but has yet to be told what they are. Natalia said: I tweeted about it and McDonaldaposs reached out over email to confirm dates and times, but again, I havenapost received an apology or some sort of compensation. I havenapost received anything. I was told theyaposd get sent off for examination and theyaposd let me know when they find out what they are, but Iaposve not heard back yet. Iaposve not been given an alternative explanation of what they could be. I have thought apos this has happened to me, surely it has happened to somebody apos.

She shared a video of the results online and soon others said it looked like she had horns, and Jessie herself said: I canapost take myself seriously.  What do you think about Jessieaposs new look  Let us know in the comments... Taking to TikTok, where she uploads as @_jessiecarr, Jessie said: These fox eye threads really are my biggest regret.It’s definitely not worth it, it doesn’t work and it left me looking botched like this! They initially swelled up really, really intensely. I looked like MegaMind. They popped a blood vessel during the procedure, I blew up for a couple of weeks, I was pretty bad. Once the swelling went down I noticed that my eyebrows had lted and I was so happy with them. Jessie said that eventually the swelling went down but she now needs to have the threads dissolved, and sheaposs asking for a discount.  She said: They gave me a partial refund and then a couple of weeks after that I noticed that I had bumps on my head and my threads were popping out and I realised and thought that it would go away but it didn’t so then I went back for another check-up. Now I’m going through a procedure called the Ultaformer, it’s supposed to dissolve the threads and I’m also taking anti-inflammatory pills to try to dull down the inflammation. It’s not promised that it will dissolve the thread but it is something that could help dissolve it. It is a gradual result so I’m hoping that that will make a dference.

These journalists have no counterparts in RussiaBBC reporter Orla Guerin in Ukraine Image: DAILY MIRRORopinionByPaul Routledge:,  Mar |comments War in Ukraine is being fought on two fronts: ­military and information.The Russian people do not know what is being done in their name. They are fed on a daily diet of lies. Our newspapers, radio and TV, sometimes derided as “mainstream media”, are doing a magnicent job of telling the truth, often at great personal risk. Reporters and photographers for the Mirror have captured in graphic, moving detail the horrors of this unfolding tragedy. The BBC, ITN and Sky News have shown equal commitment to informing the world about the brutal onslaught on Kyiv, Kharkiv and other cities. Their dedication in this second front of this war is a vital contribution to the struggle of the Ukrainian people.Their work is all the more effective for not being embedded in British or NATO forces. They’re free to use their own professional judgment, without pressure from Ministry of Defence brass hats. And, I might add, the coverage is best done by seasoned reporters, rather than highly-paid studio presenters shipped out to take centre stage in the bulletins. The BBC’s nerve and skill bringing the reality of the war to our screens has muted the usual Tory critics. Their vendetta against the Beeb looks sick in the light of front-line despatches from Lyse Doucet, James Waterhouse, Orla Guerin and Sarah Rainsford.These reporters have no counterparts in Russia. Megalomaniac dictator Vladimir Putin has closed down independent radio, TV, newspapers and websites.Close to , anti-war protesters, including children as young as seven and their mothers, have been arrested by police thugs. And from today even using the word “war” will be punished with  years in jail. That’s how important it is for us – and the Russian people – to win the information war.  Is northern generosity a myth  A survey of the UK’s kindest cities named Oxford as tops, followed by Belfast and Brighton. Not one of Yorkshire’s seven cities – Sheffield, Wakefield, Leeds, Bradford, Hull, York and Ripon – made it into the top . I find that surprising, given that people who come here say we’re very friendly and all those places have substantial ethnic populations who made it their home, except tiny Ripon, with only , citizens. The pollsters must have talked to the wrong people. That is, unless the old Tyke saying “ ever tha does owt for nowt, allus do it for thisen” is correct. Paulette for the win I sincerely hope congratulations are in order for Paulette Hamilton, who should become Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington today, after winning a by-election caused by the death of union stalwart Jack Dromey.

For all the live updates from the Russian invasion follow our live blogFierce fighting has been raging for much of the day around the Zaporizhzhia plant in southeastern Ukraine. The battle came as Putin claimed Ukraine is using civilians and foreigners as human shields - while his forces bomb densely-populated areas.The outrageous claim followed a day of continued attacks on cities including the capital Kyiv and Kharkiv, which have suffered intense damage.The city of Kherson has been taken by Russian troops but where the invaders have met with fierce Ukraine resistance. The port city of Mariupol is being catastrophically bombed round the clock and is in danger of becoming aposlike Leningradapos, according to officials.The then-Soviet city of Leningrad, now called St Petersburg, saw a protracted Nazi siege during World War , resulting in .million people killed over two years.  Dramatic maps show how invading troops have closed in, after shelling left citizens without water and in a blackout after the power was cut. Supplies are also unable to enter and people cannot evacuate. Earlier today an airstrike on an apartment block in Chernihiv killed  civilians. Putin praised his military as heroes and said all was going to plan despite reports suggesting intel showed he planned to take Kyiv within  hours. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters he must speak to Putin to stop the war. He was asked by a journalist during a press conference in Kyiv today: “You have just mentioned you want to talk with Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Putin has so far not been willing to meet with you. Do you have a message for him now that Ukrainian cities are under attack  This city is under attack. A convoy is on its way here. Is there a way to prevent this war from escalating even further, now ” Zelensky replied: “It is not about I want to talk with Putin, I think I have to talk with Putin. The world has to talk with Putin because there are no other ways to stop this war.

The move came as western states are implementing massive sanctions, including asset freezes, against Russia for invading its neighbour Ukraine.The incredible ship is valued at £m, according to VesselsValue.Mr Sechin is a long-term ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and was in  described as the second most powerful man in Russia.Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog  A separate near- million luxury yacht owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov has also been seized, by German authorities, Forbes reported. The Dilbar, which Mr Usmanov purchased in , has the largest swimming pool ever installed on a yacht. The -metre Amore Vero arrived in La Ciotat on Jan  and was due to stay there until April st for repairs, the finance ministry said in a statement, adding that the vessel was subject to the new sanctions. But on Wednesday, customs officers noted the yacht was taking steps to sail off urgently, without the repair works being over, the statement said, adding that the officers therefore decided to seize it.  The finance ministry said the yacht belongs to a company whose main shareholder is Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The superyacht was built by Oceanco in the Netherlands and delivered to its owner in , according to yachtcharterfleet. It says its onboard features include a beauty salon and gym. It sails under the flag of the Cayman islands, according to Eikon data. Thank you to the French customs officers who are enforcing the European Unionaposs sanctions against those close to the Russian government, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a Tweet.At least five other superyachts owned by Russian billionaires have arrived in the Males, according to ship tracking data. Separately, French authorities on Thursday also seized a Russian-owned cargo vessel in the port of Lorient, Brittany. The Russian invasion of Ukraine will get worse as major cities come under more indiscriminate bombing, French President Emmanuel Macron fears following a phone call with Vladimir Putin. The warning came during a day of continued attacks on cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv, which have suffered intense damage. Attempts to seize both cities have failed so Kremlin forces have instead resorted to heavy bombing, causing thousands of civilian casualties.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead pupils serve up success","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Joint Campus hosted a successful first badminton championship in the first week of February, with  players taking part.S : girls, Tegan Stewart and boys Liam Cook S girls, Emma Plummer and boys Rhys Coffield Senior girls, Jasmine McPhie and boys Archie MacColl-Smith.PICS:Receiving their trophies from head teacher Ann Devine are senior winners Jasmine McPhie, left, no_a_LHS_badminton and Archie MacColl-Smith no_a_LHS_badmintonDoubles action in full swing in the school gym. no_a_LHS_badminton"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry loop sportive announced","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe popular Kilberry Loop Sportive will take place on Saturday August  this year.Organised by Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle Club and local man John Hardie, the -mile open road event starts and finishes in Tarbert.Registered as an event with British Cycling, the fun, friendly Kilberry Loop Sportive is targeted at every level of cyclist.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.

It is a decision we have considered extremely carefully and taken with some reluctance.#In the current climate, this is undoubtedly one of the decisions over which we have deliberated the longest. Ensuring families who need it are still able to receive the support was of the utmost importance.#The delivery of the £ rebate to thousands of households is a key element of this. We can also look carefully at how we distribute our share of the £ million funding support for people on lower income, announced just a few days ago.#Councillors also backed plans to spend £, on street lighting, and £, on new litter bins across the area, as part of the authority’s budget for the year.Also part of the budget will be £, to keep seasonal public toilets open all year round, and £, to suspend off-street parking charges for the two weeks before Christmas.Staycation funding for the area will also be boosted by a further £, while investment in the area’s roads will rise to £million, with a further £, allocated to active travel.Speaking about the opposition#s proposal for an entrepreneur business improvement fund to provide support to small to medium businesses Councillor Lynch said: #The pandemic has impacted on the council, tourism, businesses and people. We are all aware that tourism is an economic driver for Argyll and Bute.#It is essential that we invest in the Argyll and Bute brand to maximise the tourism opportunities.

over the restoration of a Borders towns crest.Jedburgh’s historic Bridewell Jail was part of a refurbishment project back in .But there was anger among townsfolk at the ‘dreadful’ and ‘amateurish’ repainting of the  town crest on the outside of the building.Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton contacted the courts service to ask for the issue to be rectied.Then came lockdown and the matter was put on hold.:Man charged after footage of dog chasing fox at hunt near Kelso posted onlineFinally, last weekend, the crest was repainted – but the spelling of the Latin term on the crest was misspelt, with an ‘H’ added to the word ‘prosHpere’It read: ‘ET STRENUE AND PROSPHER’ instead of the correct ‘ET STRENUE AND PROSPERE’.The artist who carried out the work is set toto correct the error, but it has left some townsfolk fearing the project is somewhat jinxed.Mr Hamilton said: “It goes back to  when the court building was refurbished and they did a fantastic job on it and then when it came to the crest it looked like a primary school child had done it, it was dreadful on such a nice building and that caused a lot of anger in Jedburgh.:Travelodge says it wants to bring the hotel chain to this Borders town“I managed to get a meeting with Courts Scotland a few months afterwards, just before the lockdown, and they put their hands up and said they fully understood, ‘we’ve made a mess here and we’ll recty it’. Then lockdown came and no work got done and eventually theyve got around to recty it.“Now they have done it and a lot of people are quite happy with how it looks generally but not at the incorrect spelling of one of the Latin words.“The person who did it, who is not a local person, has said he will come back and recty it.“Overall the work carried out is quite welcome, it’s just this one spelling mistake which has caused a bit of upset in the town.”"},{"url":null,"title":"fairtrade-fortnight-melrose-co-op-aims-help-planet","story":"A BORDERS supermarket is highlighting its Fairtrade produce this week as part of a national initiative.The Co-op in Melrose has created a stand at the front of its shop showcasing its fairtrade products as part of Fairtrade Fortnight.The aim of the stand is to encourage shoppers to choose Fairtrade items as part of their everyday shop, supporting workers and farmers behind the produce and help tackle climate injustice.:Borders school is proud of youth climate activists initiativeA spokesperson for Melrose Co-op said: “When it’s Fairtrade Fortnight we like to encourage customers to focus on Fairtrade brands.\"But really, any time’s a good time to choose Fairtrade, because it plays an important part in addressing working conditions and fair wages for producers and farmers.\"Its also addressing the climate crisis.\"So, a fairer deal for people and planet!”:COP: Climate conference put Borders on global , meeting hearsExamples of Fairtrade items available in-store chocolate, tea, coffee, wine and bananas.A Fairtrade Foundation spokesperson said: \"Since last Fairtrade Fortnight we have seen the G and COP take place.\"Over , campaigners joined .m Fairtrade farmers and workers in backing the Be Fair With Your Climate Promise challenge to world leaders at the UN COP summit.\"But frustration came as the wealthiest nations failed to recognise the urgent need to invest in farmer expertise by delaying their promised bn annual funding to the most climate vulnerable countries until .:Council hopes to ignite positive change in Borders with climate route map\"That isn’t good enough.\"Fairtrade is about social, economic and environmental justice.\"These are built into our standards and drive everything we do.\"A root cause of the inability to adapt to and mitigate climate change is poverty.\"More money in the hands of farmers is neededthey are to adapt and survive the climate crisis.\".remove:Borders flooding has convinced a lot of folk that climate change is happeningFairtrade Fortnight will run until Sunday, March .For more information, and to read the stories from farmers affected by the climate crisis, visit: www.fairtrade.org.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"energy-saving-tips-appliances-kitchen---buy","story":"We’d all like to save money on bills and with the energy prices expected to soar following April’s price-cap hike we need cash-savingtips more than ever.According to Magnet, consumers are already starting to plan for the future when it comes to choosing their new kitchens, turning to sustainable solutionsto help keep bills low.Lizzie Beesley, Head of Design at Magnet, said: “We have seen a noticeable increase in enquiries for sustainably sourced kitchens over the past year, with homeowners looking to incorporate energy efficient appliancesin their kitchens more than ever before.“Sustainability is a crucial part of our quality promise at Magnet.

buildings in terms of the aesthetic value they bring to the town#s outstanding seafront location.I fully understand the need to reduce housing stock, in line with a declining population, but previously demolished buildings in adjacent areas – Saddell Street and Queen Street – are now unsightly gap-sites.Local opinion is important, given what has happened in the wake of recent housing

the same with modern housing – probably less stock to suit the demands that exist in the town at the moment – however, it is really important any proposed build be sensitive in design to suit this

Thursday, Ofgem announced that from April the energy price cap would rise  per cent to £, – that is an extra £ households will have to find just to keep their homes warm and the lights on.Forthcoming increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in. People need help now.Food bank volunteers need assurance that the invaluable support they provide in their communities will end one day, when wages and benefits are adequate enough for proud families to be able to stop using the food banks.New statistics show rising homelessness across Scotland. Food bank use is soaring. Illnesses of the past like rickets and malnutrition have reappeared.In a rich nation like Scotland, in the st century, this is appalling.

describes the proposals to axe music tuition as #catastrophic# and urged the council to re-consider.He wrote: #I feel it would be disastrous for the area to lose this essential musical training, not only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the world for its traditional music and it would be very unwise even to consider implementing measures which would effectively bring this reputation to an end.#He added: #I am lending my strongest support

water of le Scotland has to offer.Islay, like Campbeltown, is recognised as a distinct whisky-producing region and, despite being only  miles long, it is home to eight distilleries, with two more in the pipeline.There is perhaps a tendency to think the old names are the best, buta distillery can produce whisky which reflects the region in which it is made, particularly when the process is as environmentally friendly as possible, what#s not to like While the distillery plans are welcome news for Kintyre#s wider economy, it is also the end of an era as another dairy farm ceases production, but the Dhurrie#s previous owners, Tommy and Elaine Ralston, are well due their retirement after four decades in the industry."},{"url":null,"title":"letters february 18 2022","story":"Most people clean up after their dog, but recently East Kintyre residents have raised their concerns over dog fouling in Carradale#s harbour area, Shore Road and Brackley Cemetery.Campbeltown Grammar School and a

It is also unpleasantyou step in it and causes particular problems for people with visual impairment, people who use walking aids, for infant buggies, families enjoying green spaces and activities on sports fields.It can also lead to a disease called toxocariasis, which is linked to blindness.The Dog Fouling Act of  places responsibility on #the person in charge of the dog# at the time of the misdemeanour. Sothe dog you are walking isn#t yours, you are still liable for the fineyou don#t clear up after them.Dog mess is clearly an issue of concern to our community.What have we heard on the matter of unsightly irresponsible dog fouling in South Kintyre from our elected ward councillors  To date, nothing.The last thing we want is filthy paths, cemeteries, beaches and green spaces, enforcement and penalty fines. Don#t be the dog walker who doesn#t clean up.Tommy Macpherson, Scottish Conservative and Unionist candidate, South Kintyre ward.Households in Argyll and Bute have received £, from low income pandemic payments and £, from bridging payments that support families with children in receipt of free school meals.Across Scotland, these payments have amounted to the SNP Scottish Government delivering more than £ million to more than , low income households – including more than , school age children receiving bridging payments.The pandemic has been incredibly dficult for so many families for a iety of reasons – some have lost wages and jobs, others have seen an increase in heating bills as we all spent more time at home.I#m glad the SNP Scottish Government has been helping families in Argyll and Bute to get through this tough time with £,, of support, in addition to offering Scottish low income benefits and the Scottish Child Payment.We know that families in Argyll and Bute are going to continue to feel the pressure as we face a cost of living crisis, so it is reassuring to see the Scottish Government#s focus on helping those who need it most and their commitment to delivering bridging payments this year.Sadly, the contrast between the SNP Government in Holyrood and the Tories at Westminster could not be clearer.While the SNP get on with extending the Scottish Child Payment to under s and doubling the payment to £ per week per child from April, the Tories are cutting support for those who need it most and implementing unfair tax hikes on households.It#s now beyond all doubt that Westminster control is not working for people in Argyll and Bute. The only way to keep Scotland safe from Tory cuts is to become an independent country, with the full powers needed to build a fairer society."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week february 18 2022","story":"It was one of several nature shots Graham took during a winter break in Kintyre.If you have a photograph you would like to share, please email it to editor@campbeltowncourier or get in touch via the Courier#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils prepare for league matches","story":"Kick off is at pm.The Pupils will be hoping to continue their away day joy from two weeks ago when they secured a - victory at Glenvale.The Pupils then have another away trip scheduled the following Saturday, February , against St Peter#s in Renfrew.Then, the Pupils# conclusion to their league season sees them play four home matches in a row.For more information on everything from fixture information and matchday photography to club fundraising and the upgrades to Kintyre Park, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter and Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 18 2022","story":"Instinctively, I would answer: #Doubt.#But is that right  The opposite of faith is surely not doubt, but certainty. If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"town causes to land co op cash","story":"Thanks to Co-op members choosing the supermarket#s own-branded products and services, over £ million has been raised for more than , causes since .Each year, members are encouraged to pick a local cause in their community that supports access to food, mental wellbeing support or opportunities for young people, helping to build stronger, more resilient communities across the UK.In Tarbert, Fèis an Tairbeirt, Tarbert Soccer Centre and Tarbert After School Care are to receive grants and, in Mid Argyll, Argyll and Bute Befrienders, Mid-Argyll Transport Volunteers and Mid Argyll Multiple Sclerosis Centre will benefit.#We know that this year is going to be another incredibly challenging year for local causes and communities,# said Rebecca Birkbeck, director of community and membership at the Co-op.#With the cost of living rising dramatically already this year, charities are likely to bear the brunt of people being more conscious about their spending.#At the Co-op, we work hard to bring people together to ‘co-operate for a fairer world’.

The mine was finally rediscovered by HMS Bicester early last week.Bad weather made it impossible for the crew of the Bicester to attach a surface riser to it and the mine was left to a Navy ing team to bring it up.Led by Lt Adrian Dann, the four-man Northern Diving Team from Faslane finally pinpointed the mine on Tuesday morning and brought it up later that day.The two-tonne mine is currently lying on the New Quay waiting to be picked up by the mine laying team from Cromby, Fe.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown churchgoers, in common with other congregations throughout the country, are being asked to sign petition forms calling for an end to public filth in television and literature.Already many people, including non-churchgoers, have appended their names to the forms which are also in several businesses in the town.The forms are headed: ‘Petition for public decency.’It states: ‘Being concerned about the effect on society – particularly on the young – and of the increasing exploitation of sex, the public portrayal of intimate or unnatural sexual behaviour and violence and brutality, we the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s government: to note the concern of the public about this matter. to ensure that the law as regards of sanity stops this public affront and is so designed as to be an effective instrument for the maintenance of public decency.Some church congregations in the town have already begun signing the petition and others planned to follow suit in the near future.All of Campbeltown’s ministers are in agreement that the obscenities on television and in literature are going too far, and hope that the petition has the desired effect.The Reverend James W Hood, of Lorne Street Church, commented yesterday: ‘I think it is perfectly right that the church should be given the opportunity of speaking its mind.’SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe majesty and pomp of King George VI#s funeral procession through London, and later its journey to Windsor Castle, was seen and heard by people in Campbeltown and Tarbert on Friday, in the history-making experimental television broadcast.In both places, reception was remarkably clear and those who were privileged to see it saw this royal journey of dignied and poignant pageantry in a much greater detail than the vast crowds in London and Windsor.At both places, the sets, with -inch screens, were shown by radio dealers to parties of friends.Mr Anthony P MacGrory, Campbeltown town councillor and housing convener, had his set installed in the radio showroom of his firm’s shop in Main Street.At Tarbert, the set there was arranged by Mr Douglas C Smith, Electrical and Radio Engineer, Harbour Street.Earlier last month, Mr Smith informed us that he was getting surprisingly good results from the test from the Scottish television station at Kirk o’ Shotts – the Scottish station which is using only low power transmission.Scottish TV reception of this historical occasion was the previous day viewed with serious misgivings and doubts by BBC experts, who pointed out that the Kirk o’ Shotts station was not due to open until March  and that this is the first-ever television radio link up, connecting Scotland to London, through Manchester, was merely an experiment and the Scottish transmitters were still undergoing adjustment.So, until the TV programme went onto the air on Saturday, the BBC could give no guarantee that the venture would be successful.It was a great success and thousands of Scots over a wide area, from Dumfries to Aberdeen, saw clear pictures of the funeral processions.At Campbeltown and Tarbert, the pictures were almost as clear as everyone was looking at them on the cinema screen, the detail in some of the pictures being unbelievably perfect.One local businessman, who saw it, described it as ‘uncanny’.But, throughout the years, this has been the descriptive of all great inventions when they first made their impact on the public mind.It was a pity, of course, that this great moment in Scottish television progress should have been heralded in with such a sad event as the funeral of our King.Considering that Kintyre was not regarded as a good reception area and that this  miles relay was the longest ever attempted by the BBC, the result was truly amazing and will no doubt mean the booking of many orders from this part of the country.Already, Mr McGrory has been receiving enquiries from ious parts of Argyll.We were privileged to see the screening in Mr MacGrory’s premises that afternoon. The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to watch the Royal coffin being carried out and upon it the Imperial State Crown, the orb and the sceptre and the white wreath of orchids, camellias and lilies of the valley from Her Majesty, the Queen

What#s inside the singing kettle # # which Artie still uses today.While this principle was always central to the action, plot lines and stage sets were built around imaginative story lines, transforming the original concept into a spectacular musical for the whole family.The Singing Kettle turned children’s theatre into an art form and the troupe#s unique performances became the bench mark for fellow professionals everywhere.They performed in hundreds of venues, from the Palladium in London to the Town Hall in Campbeltown, from the Palace Theatre in Kilmarnock to the Royal Palace in Jordan.BAFTA-award winning and decorated with MBEs for services to children’s entertainment, audiences worldwide were hooked on their madcap musical adventures flavoured with cheeky Scottish humour.Adults and children alike found themselves singing the songs together long after the performances were over.The company closed in , with the final line-up forming Fun Box and with Cilla retiring.Artie continued performing solo shows as Artie#s Tartan Tales but since the beginning of  his show is now Artie#s Singing Kettle.There is a £ one price ticket for the show, plus booking fee.

As a result, some of the nation’s fish and chip shops are now struggling for survival.As they are not protected by the energy price cap, chip shops are now facing huge rises in energy costs. Some members of NFFF have reported electricity bills going up from £ to £, a month.The NFFF is urging the government to reconsider its planned  per cent increase on VAT in April, which is an added concern for the industry.The spiralling costs hitting fish and chip shops include a  per cent rise in the cost of cod since October,  per cent rise in the cost of haddock in the last year,  per cent rise in the cost of mushy peas, and  per cent rise in the cost of batter.Industry leaders now say that chip shops will have to raise prices to survive but many could be forced out of business.In , East Coast was crowned one of the UK’s  Best Fish  Chip Takeaways for the second year running – the only chippy in Edinburgh and the Lothians to make the list.The accolade followed an extensive search by trade publication Fry Magazine to find the chippies serving up the finest fish suppers amid the ongoing challenges of the Covid- pandemic.Mr Crolla runs the Musselburgh takeaway and restaurant with his we Katia, and his family have been serving the local community for nearly  years.He said: “By teaming up with the National Federation of Fish Friers we hope to do our bit by encouraging people to support their local fish and chip shop around Scotland during these extremely challenging times.“Our family has been proudly serving the local community with quality fish and chips for nearly  years, but the spiralling costs battering our industry are putting all that at risk.“We won’t compromise on quality, but these external factors will inevitably mean a rise in costs for us and our customers.”Andrew Crook, president of the NFFF, added: “We are in unprecedented times where we are seeing high levels of inflation, and food inflation is even higher.“Most of the supplies we use in the fish and chip industry have increased drastically in price and we are expecting this to continue for some considerable time.“Other products are simply not available, and we have seen suppliers move away from the sector.“Fish and chip shops like East Coast in Musselburgh do feel the effect of these increases more than most cuisines as our margins are much tighter. The price of fish is comparable to steak in supermarkets.“As a result of this, and our commitment to ensuring a high-quality, good-value product, we may regrettably be forced to review our prices to reflect the rising costs our industry is facing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mothers-day-chocolate-gifts-can-buy-year-including-hotel-chocolat","story":"And theres plenty to choose from!

Musselburgh is one of  golf courses to have hosted the oldest golf championship in the world, which this year celebrates its own milestone with The th Open Championship being held at St Andrews in July.To mark the th anniversary of golf at Musselburgh, Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club– which later this month celebrates the th year of its re-founding in  – is hosting a series of events across , ending with a gala dinner in the town in September.This Saturday, members of MOCGC will contest the club’s th Anniversary Stroke-play Championship. On July , more than  golf clubs and foundations from across Scotland have been invited to participate in an -hole tournament on the Old Course.Sir John Foulis of Ravelston’s game  years ago was referenced in The Golf Book Of East Lothian, compiled and documented by John Kerr, M.A, F.R.S.E, F.S.A.Scot, the Minister of Dirleton, which was published in .Golf may have been played by royalty at Musselburgh even earlier than . Mary Queen of Scots was reported on her indictment in  to have played golf ‘at Seton’, most likely at Musselburgh, while her son King James VI was also reported to have played golf there.Musselburgh’s Old Course has left a “lasting legacy” on golf in many factors. The accepted diameter of a golf holewas the width of the piece of drainpipe used at Musselburgh to cut the holes. This was adopted by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club in  as the official measurement requirement for all golf holes, as they standardised the rules of golf.The Old Course is also regarded as the birthplace of competitive women’s golf. As early as , the local fishwives were reported to have indulged in golf on their days off. In , the club that later became Royal Musselburgh sponsored a women’s golf competition on New Year’s Day with prizes – a fishing basket and silk handkerchiefs.Perhaps the most famous of the many golfing families to have been based at Musselburgh were the Park family. Willie Park Senior, born in Wallyford, was the first winner of The Open in , and went on to win it a further three times. His brother Mungo won the first Open Championship played at Musselburgh in , while Willie Park Junior was a two-time winner, including in , the final year that Musselburgh hosted The Open.Steven Hill, captain of Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club, said the anniversary was “a momentous day” for everyone connected with the course, adding: “To be captain of our club in this historic year is a tremendous honour for me.“While our club only dates back  years, in that time we have helped to restore the Old Course to its former glory. The history of Musselburgh Links is precious – the members of our club recognise our role as protectors of this ancient course, and hold its traditions very dear to our hearts, including continuing to play hickory golf here.“We are immensely proud that Musselburgh is one of only  courses in the UK to have hosted The Open and it is fitting that, in the same year when The th Open Championship is played at St Andrews, our course can also celebrate a signicant milestone.“Most of our members grew up playing on the Old Course. In this anniversary year, we want to secure a lasting legacy for golf here by encouraging the next generation of local golfers to experience Musselburgh Links and become part of its future. We also welcome visitors from across the world to visit and join us in our celebrations.”Angela Howe, director at The RA World Golf Museum, said: “The Open has been played at some of the world’s most historic golf courses and Musselburgh is undoubtedly one of them. As one of the three prestigious venues, with Prestwick and St Andrews, which played host to the early days of The Open and the home course of the great Park family among others, it has a rich golfing heritage. It’s wonderful to see this remarkable milestone being celebrated in such fitting style throughout the year.”Michael Beamish, captain of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, said: “The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers has written records stretching back more than  years. Originally based in Leith and, since , at Muirfield, the club grew and flourished during the period when Musselburgh Links was its home.“Musselburgh Links was the home of The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers from  until . In , The Honourable Company built a clubhouse in Golf Place at the west end of the Links and throughout this period both the town and the nine-hole course played a leading role in the development of the rapidly growing game of golf. Musselburgh and the Links have a long, important and distinguished history and deserve the title ‘The Cradle of Golf.’“The Honourable Company would like to congratulate the clubs at Musselburgh Links and the affiliates involved in managing and maintaining the course, enjoyleisure and East Lothian Council, for such a wonderful golfing legacy, and send very best wishes for the th anniversary celebrations.”John McMillan, Provost of East Lothian, said: “The Old Course has a very special place in both East Lothian and Scottish golfing history. Ever since March , the course has been recognised as a wonderful place to play golf and the fact that it is one of only  venues to have hosted The Open is testament to that.“We are very proud of the fact that East Lothian is Scotland’s Golf Coast, with an unparalleled selection of courses, including the Old Course, which golfers continue to enjoy to this day.“I’m delighted that the council and enjoyleisure are working with Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club in celebrating this remarkable milestone and I’d like to congratulate all involved as their plans take shape for a year of celebration.”Bill Axon, chief executive of enjoyleisure, said: “We’re delighted to be marking this signicant milestone in Musselburgh Links’ history, in conjunction with Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club, Musselburgh Links Ladies Golf Club and East Lothian Council.“It’s an absolute joy to be able to provide public access to this magnicent course witnessing children take their first drive engaging with locals on their ,th round and welcoming international enthusiasts eager to tick off another majestic round on an historic Open Championship course from their bucket list.“Musselburgh Links is truly the people’s golf course which is enjoyed by all ages and abilities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"celebrity-conservationist-backs-petition-remove-bird-netting-north-berwick-tesco","story":"The supermarket giants had implemented the netting to the exterior of the building to protect customers from pigeon droppings.The petition has reached more than  signatures in little over a day as the community has come together to protect the local bird population.: More than  people sign online petition to remove bird netting from North Berwick TescoHouse martins are a protected species by law and interfering with their nests is a punishable offence, but many conservationists worry that preventative measures such as these risk the future of the species.Mr Packham said on Twitter: \"Hello Tesco, we’ve been here before haven’t we \"Please fast track the solution which was to take down the nets , put up cameras and screens in the store and show your customers that you care about birds in the bioersity crisis we sadly find ourselves in.\"Hello @Tesco we’ve been here before haven’t we   Please fast track the solution which was to take down the nets , put up cameras and screens in the store and show your customers that you care about birds in the bioersity crisis we sadly find ourselves in .

His impact on the world of dance since the s is unparalleled, not only for the choreography, which had all the precision of ballet training with a decidedly post-punk attitude, but for his close collaboration with artists, designers, costumiers, and musicians. He took that to a dferent level.The exhibition brings all of these together. Curated and organised by the Barbican in London it had to close after just one month due to Covid restrictions, so the team who brought it together from archives and newly commissioned pieces is more than pleased that it will have a full run at Scotland’s design museum.Florence Ostende, Curator of Cosmic Dancer also believes that: “The VA in Dundee is the perfect location, even down to the architecture. The building has the idea of movement and motion, so it’s a perfect home.”That idea of conveying movement throughout the exhibition was vital adds Ostende.“When you work on a dancer or choreographer the materiality of what should be on display is challenging. It’s dferent from a painter or a sculptor – how will be visitors experience the strength of his work over several decades  How can we make it immersive  Not to replicate a theatre but to understand how he has been incorporated every element into his work.”Ostende adds that working with the VA in Dundee led to the decision to make part of the exhibition free in the foyer. “It was a generous proposal from the team there and it goes further to it being accessible to everyone.”Perhaps the most accessible part of Clark’s work to the uninitiated is the music. He was one of the few artists that was given permission by David Bowie to use his music. Bowie also attended performances in New York.The I Am Curious Orange was a collaboration with post-punk pioneers The Fall and he also collaborated with Scritti Politti. However, classical composers such as Stravinsky and Satie were also a part of his work.“His relationship to pop culture and music is particularly relatable,” says Ostende.“Much of the understanding of his work has been rooted in the s club scene, so when we opened initially, we wonderedthat would be our audience. Of course we had that, but the amount of young people who came to see it – that was beyond our expectations. “The exhibition has films, sculptures, paintings, costumes and photographs from his collaborators, alongside rare archival material, placing Clark within a wider cultural context.Also his groundbeaking work with filmmakers such as Peter Greenaway and Derek Jarman, fashion designers  including Vivienne Westwood, Alexander McQueen, Gucci and Pringle of Scotland.Kate Coyne is Associate Director of the Michael Clark Company and was a dancer there for more than  years, first auditioning at  but deciding to work with other companies before finally finding herself back there.“I was about  when I joined – at  I would have been too young for the work Michael was doing. I needed experience – in dance and le.”Coyne and Ostende have been working closely together on the exhibition together with three researchers, not a huge team for the scale of the exhibition.Maybe more than anyone  Coyne is qualied to talk about the uncompromising costumes that Clark has commissioned throughout the years.“They are certainly challenging for the dancers,” she laughs. “He likes to see how someone will rise to the challenge. There are certain looks like the David Bowie jackets for come, been and gone that were very restrictive but I think they informed the movement and they did look really sharp.”The coming together of dance company and gallery was key to making this as representative to Michael Clark’s breadth of work, she believes.“I think that Florence being an art curator has worked so will,” she says. “She could really inidualise each of the artists but also tie them to Michael in the most incredible way.”And Michael himself  It seems that he was involved in initial conceptual phase but then stepped back and allowed the team to get on with it.“Of course Michael is the key part of it but he was keen not to put his stamp on what it should be.”Michael Clark: Cosmic Dancer runs from Saturday, March , to Sunday, September  .

In fact, we know that it was self-appointed Russian \"observers\" who sought to cast doubt on the conduct of the vote – claims which were roundly dismissed by the Electoral Commission. Likewise, it does not need a lot of thought to conclude which result would have suited the Kremlin better: an intact UK secure within Nato or a fractured UK polity, with Nato disrupted by doubts about the future locationof a major arm of its nuclear deterrent forces When you add in the predominance of pro-Yes coverage by Russian news media during the campaign and RTs recruitment of ex-SNP luminaries Alex Salmond and Tasmina Sheikh Ahmad, you have to wonder what planet Michael Russell is living on. There is no doubt at all which outcome Vladimir Putin and his goons would have favoured – and it is not No.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.WE WOULD STAY IN ALLIANCERICHARD Allisonis of the opinion that independence would probably mean Scotland being outside of Nato. It is not clear why he thinks this given the SNP, and for that matter the Conservatives or Labour who might possibly gain power with independence, all favour Nato membership.A glance at a school atlas will reveal to Mr Allison Scotland’s strategic location where the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea converge, a location which Nato would definitely want within its sphere of influence – nuclear bombs or not on the Clyde.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDSADAM Tomkins has hit the nail on the head . In many ways, we now have the best of both worlds, we are both British and Scottish. Why then be forced to choose between them Scots used to be famous for being canny they knew when they were on to a good thing. We have the British navy and the RAF and army to protect our islands . We have the security and reputation of the pound for our currency. For most other things, we have our own politicians in Holyrood, and we elected them democratically.As many columnists have noted, independence for the SNP is a matter of the heart not the head. Wordsworth would have voted for it in his youth when he was enraptured by the French Revolution .

It retells the story of how he fooled fellow pupils and teachers for two years to get another shot at medical school.Cumming mimes an audio interview with Mr MacKinnon throughout the film so convincingly even singer Lulu who voices a teacher in the film did not realise it was not him speaking.Speaking to The Herald, Lulu said: “I thought the voice was Alan. I thought he had a cold. It was a real mastery.”Cumming explained that each part of the interview was put on a loop with regular beep noises keeping the tempo.“It was kind of torturous for the crew. People left the room,” he said.: Fans queue for six hours ahead of outlander season  preview at GFF\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Lulu at the Glasgow Film Festival \" class\"editor-image\"Lulu at the Glasgow Film FestivalThe -year-old actor explained that the interview shaped his performance: “It was partly the look of him – the look we went for – but also his voice is kind of immobile.“The character of him was so dictated by the voice and normally you do that as an actor.”Director Jono McLeod compared it to “watching an Olympic performance”.He said: “I have never seen anyone do anything like that.”Mr McLeod has a personal connection with the documentary having gone to Bearsden Academy with the -year-old pupil.The truth about Mr MacKinnon only emerged when he tried to enrol at Dundee University to study medicine.He had previously failed at his first attempt as a medical student at Glasgow University prompting his decision to try again.The director of the documentary believes he may not have gotten away with it for so long at another school.He said: “I look at it as a ide between Bearsden and maybe the town surrounding it.“I do wonderBrandon had rocked up at Clydebank High, which was the school I was meant to go to, whether the kids there would have maybe been a bit more bullish about finding out more about Brandon than us ‘polite’ Bearsden educated kids.”Jono McLeod and classmate Nicola Walker : VA spotlight: Michael Clark: Cosmic DancerBeing from Clydebank, he believes it gave him a unique perspective on the events which unfolded at Bearsden Academy.“I didn’t have that connection to all the Bearsden kids that they all had,” Mr McLeod said.“They were hanging out in the evening and socialising in that way. Now,  years later, it has kind of stood me in good stead because I am an outside observer in the documentary but at the same time I was there.”He is not the only member of the crew to have a previous connection to the film with Cumming previously agreeing to a feature film about the events.The star added: “I think it is really interesting when things or people come back into your le, and you think this could be better. This is how it is meant to be.”Cumming also believes My Old School makes for a “much better film” about Mr McKinnon.“I just love the fact that this was told by the people who were actually there.“It’s about what they feel about it now. They’re looking back at it. It throws up many more questions about the legacy of it. I think it is much more interesting.”Lulu, who also sings the title song in the film, saw it as an opportunity to play a Scottish role in a film.“I am a part-time actress obviously because I am a singer, a musician. I’ve never really played a Scottish person – I have got to be able to do that. I am . It is time,” she said.The musician provides a voice for one of the teachers, with many characters being portrayed through animation.She added: “The fact that this is a true story is probably one of the most fascinating things about it.”One of the central themes to the film according to its director was the “privilege to go to Bearsden”.He added: “Certainly, this film taps into the idea that some of us were gted chances in le that others weren’t. When someone tries to achieve or at least tries to get those chances that other people have why shouldn’t they be able to do that.”Meanwhile, Cumming saw Mr McKinnon’s second go at le as being a specically a “Scottish thing”.“We encourage giving another go, having another bash. That’s what he was doing,” he added.“There is also the dual thing that Scots think of ourselves as being very canny and that we know a scammer, but we were duped.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Like countless others watching the invasion unfold on the news, from a position of safety, we are deeply moved and appeal for your urgency in introducing sanctions on Russian activity in the UK.#We appeal to you to take immediate action to address the activity of state-owned Russian vessels in UK waters at this time, in particular the activities by Sovcomflot oil tankers in the Northern Isles of Scotland. We are aware of the vessel NS Challenger, owned by Sovcomflot, which was permitted to take on cargo at Sullom Voe Oil terminal, in Shetland on the February .#Following the media statements from Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP, another Sovcomflot vessel NS Champion has cancelled its berth in Scapa Flow, Orkney on the March , .#It is with our disappointment that sanctions were not imposed prior to this Sovcomflot activity in Shetland, however we hope that similar commercial activity in our waters is restricted in future.#We, the undersigned, fully support the UK Government extending sanctions to mody the obligations of Open Port Duty, Section  of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act , to be applied to the activity of Russian state-owned vessels and their use of UK ports.#Elected members of Orkney Islands Council, as the Orkney Harbour Authority, continue to uphold the Port Marine Safety Code and the obligations covered by the Pilotage Act .#The letter was signed by all  councillors.

Over the past week,  cases were recorded, bringing the case total since the pandemic began to ,.Following a meeting of the Orkney Local Emergency Co-ordination Group , on Monday morning, vice-chair of the group and corporate director Neighbourhood Services and Infrastructure, Hayley Green, said:“As the UK and Scottish Governments move forward with their plans for ‘living safely with COVID’, which includes a lessening and doing away with restrictions depending on whether you are north or south of the border, we, in Orkney, are facing something of a dilemma given that we are behind the curve.“We are seeing very high rates of transmission, and this is impacting heavily across our services – most notably within the care sector and our schools and nurseries – but really most areas are now being affected given the level of positive cases and the requirement for isolation.“We have reached the point in schools and nurseries whereby we have exhausted supply staff as a contingency and middle and senior staff, including head teachers, who were helping to keep classes open by teaching themselves or taking on janitorial or cleaning duties for example, are now also off due to COVID and other sickness.“Not only are children off due to catching the virus, but others are having to stay home due to a lack of staff – this is having a negative knock-on effect on working parents who are having to either work from homethat is possible or take time off when it is not.“It has also become apparent that we are now witnessing children in schools who have become infected for a second time.”The council stressed that schools are trying to ensure remote learning can be provided when possible – and there are enough staff to make it happen.Within adult care services, many are now feeling the impact and as a result two of our older people’s day care services on the Mainland will be closed from Wednesday as staff are deployed to assist within residential care homes. Those affected are being informed. There are further staffing challenges in adult social work and Occupational Therapy.Ms Green continued: “The closure of any service is as a last resort, but we have no choice to ensure we can safely manage to run our residential care facilities. The situation will be monitored closely and as soon as we are in a position to reopen safely then we will let everyone know.“Our care staff and the families of residents have done an outstanding job in keeping this virus at bay and out with our care facilities up until recent times but given the widespread transmission and the reduction in restrictions it has meant it was almost inevitable that this was going to happen at some point.”Staffing challenges are also being felt across the Leisure and Culture service, with some gym and swimming pool sessions and exercise classes being cancelled. The council-run St Magnus Café, Community Centre, and Town Hall have also been affected by closures and reduced opening hours.A plan has been agreed to ensure some level of service continues at the popular cafe during this challenging period and is being trialled this weekuntil the end of March, opening from .-. Monday-Friday with an amended menu.Given the infection levels, the council will be maintaining all current related COVID  restrictions for the time being, including working from homeyou can, and this will be reviewed again during March.A spokeswoman for NHS Orkney added: “We praise the community for their continued, regular use of lateral flow tests and urge everyone to continue using these. Particularly before meeting up with family, friends, travelling and attending events.“Logging lateral flow results is just as important and we ask you all to log both negative and positive results. When a positive lateral flow test is logged you will then receive information on isolation etc.“We’re continuing to ask all NHSO health care staff to continue with lateral flow testing when coming to work and this will be in place for the time being.”You can log your results by visiting: www.gov.uk report-covid-resultcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands.

Stormont is broken and she will help lead the fight by Aontuacute to make the democratic institutions work.ldquoRosemary will also stand strong for the human right to le for everyone. She fully supports the integrated education sector but will fight for equality and parity of esteem in the education system, especially for rural schools and will oppose the Integrated Education Bill.

The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time. Off went Rory Mason and Adam Kearney to be replaced with Eoin Rooney and Keegan Domican.As the game settled after the restart on  minutes, Campbell blazed a half chance over when well-placed following a corner for the home side.The next attack did bring the equaliser the home outfit craved. The ball fell to the feet of Callum Dougan after a Mills attack down the right looked like coming to nothing and he despatched it to the back of the net with aplomb. The clock ticked by with  minutes gone and both sides were now level.On  minutes Daniel Bell replaced Conor Carew in the engine room for The Mills and as the game heated up and became quite frantic around the  minute mark, McGivern was booked for two strong challenges in quick succession.As the game entered the final few minutes, Marc Reid made a top level save with an acrobatic reflex to push the ball onto the roof of the net when it didnrsquot seem possible showing shades of Gordon Banks.The away team were now pushing hard for the winner they craved and were blown up for an offside call on  minutes with Naseem Ouldhamiat through on goal.As the dust settled and a level of calm was restored the referee blew for full-time.A local derby which was keenly contested throughout and a draw was probably a fair result on the balance of play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"First half nightmare for Ballynahinch at home  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH lost out to Portrush on home soil in their latest Ulster Intermediate League encounter at the weekend.lsquoHinch began strongly and on the attack from the first whistle as Alex Millar was quickly able to play the ball out from the back and up to Matthew Martin.The Ballynahinch player played the ball up to Kyle Patterson on the left wing, who was able to slot the ball in off the back post to put his side on the scoresheet.Portrush were quickly on the counter attack down the right-hand side only to be stopped by Ashley Brown and lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell.Portrush were determined to level the game and were able to slip the ball from the baseline through a crowded circle before putting the ball in at the back post.Leslie Harrison played the ball out to Scott Leetch on the right, who was able to pass up to Craig Harkness and over to Michael Carney and Jason Campbell up front.They were able to create chance after chance, but were denied by the Portrush lsquokeeper and their defence.lsquoHinch came out in the second quarter looking to add to the scoreline.

The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close. In their petition to planners they say that the nearest gardens to the track are just  metres away and  dwellings and two major residential homes for the elderly are within  metres of the site.ldquoThe noise generated by the use of the track is likely to be highly detrimental to residents over a wide area, they claim. ldquoSuch a track is likely to operate from Easter until the end of September at least at weekends and almost certainly daily from am until pm during July and August.

She said items are even thrown at passing cars in the townrsquos main streets.The discussion centred on the possibility of including Killyleagh in any further council bye-laws to prohibit drinking in public.The councillors urged the committee to contact the council to make them aware of the need for the bye-laws.BISHOPSCOURT ndash The owners of the former Bishopscourt airfield have outlined their plans to turn it into an international standard motor-cycle race track.Owners David Beattie and John Grfin believe the track can become one of the best circuits in Britain in the next two to three years.They pledged the former RAF base will be transformed over the coming weeks into a circuit as good as any in Ireland.And they have promised to bring over some of the top names in world motor-cycle racing, with the eventual target a world championship grand prix race.The duo gave a detailed outline of their proposals at a special press conference held in Strangford on Thursday night.

A number of owners want to leave the industry, but this will not let them get out, he added.Mr Curran said Northern Ireland fishermen were in dficulty, with some living on the breadline.Accusing the Government of selfishness, Mr Curran continued: ldquoThe level of funding for this scheme is disgraceful.He added: ldquoI will be asking our local MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, to come to Ardglass to make sure that the case of local fishermen is given a fair hearing.CROSSGAR ndash A high school headmaster has warned that teachersrsquo jobs are at risk unless the Government makes alterations to the LMS funding system.Mr Colm Hanna, principal of Crossgarrsquos St Colmcillersquos High School, said this week that unless the Government removes the responsibility of teachersrsquo salaries from school budgets then staff may be laid off.Addressing his schoolrsquos annual prize distribution on Wednesday night, Mr Hanna said it was wrong for schools to have to make the decision on how many teachers should be employed and their levels of pay.ldquoOn introduction the Government was at great pains to assure us that the purpose of LMS was to enable schools to decide their own priorities in the allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching unions and their demands for better promotion prospects and smaller classes, and it decided to off-load the problems, via LMS, on to inidual schools who now have to take the decision about class size, the number of teachers to be employed and their levels of pay, he added.SEAFORDE ndash A new phase in the drive to plant one million new trees in Northern Ireland was officially launched at a

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy.

The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation’s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.The Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in  to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House.Now, the institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.“The opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,” said Rev Anderson.“This project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.“The need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in , we purchased the Loughgall building in , renovation work began in May , and I’m delighted to say we’re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April .“It has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way. “We had originally hoped to open the building in , so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule. But we were fairly relaxed about the delay as our focus was always about completing the building to a high standard rather than rushing to a completion date.“There are so many people to thank for all their hard work but I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the contractors, Weir Bros Construction, for their professionalism and attention to detail, and to our own clerk of works, Edgar Patterson, and quantity surveyor, Keith Anderson, and the entire Royal Black HQ project team, for their passion, commitment and expertise over the last few years.“Thanks to the efforts of everyone involved, we now have modern headquarters from which we can proudly maintain our stand for the Reformed Faith and strengthen our Christian and charitable outreach.”The building itself has an interesting history. At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house. A later inhabitant was Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, a senior British Army officer and former chief of the Imperial General Staff, who fought in both world wars. In more recent times it housed a popular antiques business.The grand opening will also include the opening of a ‘Leaders’ Legacy’ exhibition on the lives of past sovereign grand masters, and the unveiling and dedication of a bust of Sir Norman Stronge.

It is a lelong quest.“It is very dficult to start in jazz as an adult.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

CCR says it is committing £. million to the project in total, which includes the purchase price.The other £. million will be spent on \"demolition, remediation, and re-development\".The contracts have now been exchanged between Cardf Capital Region and energy giant RWE, the seller. The distinctive Aberthaw Power Station as seen from the air. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The Cardf Capital Region have released a proposed \"master plan\" for the redevelopment of the site, which they say \"will take several years to come to fruition given the nature of and complexities involved in the transitioning process\".In sum, CCR says it will:Support the production of renewable and green energy projectsProvide an accompanying battery storage facility to support the green energy projectsProduce a zero-carbon manufacturing cluster which will include green hydrogen production facilitiesProvide a green energy innovation centre to promote innovation, growth, knowledge and community interaction with the zero-carbon future of WalesBe responsible for the development and maintenance of a bio-erse ecology park which will include a visitor centre, providing amenities to the local communityCreate the correct conditions to support industrial de-carbonisation and future giga-plant facilities.Cardf Capital Region also says the project has \"the potential to create thousands of direct, indirect and induced jobs, along with local supply chain and upskilling benefits\", though no further details were supplied as to what that means in practical terms. An artists impression of the Aberthaw Power Station site created by London real estate giant, Reef Group for Cardf Capital Region The master plan of the site produced by London real estate giant Reef Group on behalf of Cardf Capital Region The CCR goes on to say that it will \"maintain a strong commitment to engage and involve local community stakeholders in order to develop an open, inclusive and participative ethos as soon as the commercially sensitive considerations have been addressed.\"There are areas of the site which require ongoing custodianship, in respect of nature, bioersity and managing the overall ecology of the site, which will be best achieved in partnership with community.\"The Aberthaw nature reserve. The lagoon is where the ancient Aberthaw harbour was situated before it was destroyed to make way for the power station. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The group also says that its redevelopment plan will \"commit to safeguarding and developing the Nature Reserve, working with colleagues in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to ensure effective plans are put in place. In the interim, whilst plans are worked through, commitment is given to ensure this ecologically valuable component of the site is protected and, wherever possible, further enhanced and augmented\".However, Cardf Capital Region, despite promising to work with local residents in the future, stops short of making specic reference to concerns raised by members of the nearby community recently. Those concerns centre around what will happen to the  metre high pulverised ash mound, the sea wall being breached by the tide, and problems with traffic due to poor local transport infrastructure. The long Aberthaw Power Station ash mound, m high. The smoke stack can be seen in the background. Photo: Siriol Grfiths \"Well believe these plans when we see them,\" Paul Turner told The National. He has been living in the shadow of the power station since  and says that since then, he and his we Sara have seen many ideas come and go, including nuclear power and tidal energy. \"Everybody who lives near that site knows how toxic it is.

It followed an announcement by car battery manufacturer, Britishvolt, that it was creating a factory in Northumberland, whereas St Athan had been its original preferred location. March  : Aberthaw Power Station as photographed from the Wales Coast Path.

By October , it was also reported that a new commission was being set up to explore building a barrage across the Severn estuary for tidal energy CCR is a part of that commission. However, a statement supplied by Welsh Government Economy Minister, Vaughan Gething, does moot the possibility of tidal energy: \"The proposed plan for Aberthaw is positive news which fits well with our commitment to develop tidal lagoon projects and support ideas that can help Wales become a world centre for emerging tidal technologies\".Mr Gethings enthusiasm is echoed by the UK governments Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies, who is the Conservative MP for Monmouth: \"The UK Government’s investment in the Cardf Capital Region will deliver thousands of jobs at Aberthaw and help put Wales on course for an economic recovery from the pandemic.\"The current s of the Cardf Capital Region - including any activity at Aberthaw - will eventually move into the new South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee .Three other Corporate Joint Committees will cover the rest of Wales in the south-west, the north, and the central area of the country.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I can’t wait to hear what the children think of it.“This new school building will provide a modern teaching and learning environment for staff and pupils, as well as a range of facilities for the local community.”The design includes solar  with battery storage, an air source heat pump, electric vehicle charging points, storage space for bicycles and scooters, and green habitat areas.Contractors ISG began building the school in January last year, which forms part of the council’s wider £ million programme of new school buildings across the Vale.Cllr Burnett added: “The council has made a climate commitment through our Project Zero initiative, which aims to make the organisation carbon neutral by . Delivering schools like this, which are extremely environmentally friendly, is a key part of that pledge.“This is the latest project in our Sustainable Communities for Learning programme, a far-reaching body of work intended to transform educational facilities across the Vale.”Protests were sparked by the decision to relocate Llancarfan Primary School from its village setting five miles down the road to Rhoose, with some parents opposing what they saw as the closure of a rural school. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Meanwhile, residents in council flats in Butetown are still waiting for contractors to begin installing replacement cladding, with no start date announced yet.Flats at Loudon House and Nelson House in Butetown were also found to have flammable cladding in the wake of the Grenfell fire.Delays to both the council flats in Llandaff North and Butetown were due to inflation caused by Brexit and the pandemic, according to the council, as well as changes to the safety testing rules for new cladding. The estimated cost of replacing cladding at Lydstep doubled from £. million to £ million.Cllr Thorne added: “Progress on this work has been affected by signicant cost rises due to Brexit and inflationary pressures in the building industry, as well as the impact of the extensive testing and regulation framework for cladding solutions.“Throughout this time, we have been so grateful to the residents for their patience as we worked on finding the right solution for the three blocks, and it’s great to see contractors on site and work underway.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

While most children aged  to  will have mild diseasethey contract COVID-, some may experience symptoms which last longer than just a few days. Vaccination of children in this age group has been shown to help prevent the small number of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions that can occur in this age group. It has also been shown to help provide short-term protection against non-severe disease. Dr Jillian Johnston, Joint Interim Assistant Director in Health Protection at the PHA, said: “We know the COVID risk for young children is less than for older people, but we also know the vaccine is very safe, has already been used extensively around the world, and there is no evidence that it causes any long term issues. When you look at the risk of COVID- against the risk of the vaccine, it’s more beneficial for children to receive the vaccine. It not only boosts the child’s immunity against the risk of severe disease, but helps protect more vulnerable or older family members in advance of any potential future wave of COVID-.” A new specially-designed children’s formulation of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID- vaccine has been approved for this age group and it’s given at a lower dose compared with that used in iniduals aged  and above . Like all children’s vaccines, this approval was given following a robust review of data showing that it is safe and effective to use in this cohort. Clinical trials have shown that this vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID- in children, protecting them and also reducing the chance that they transmit the virus to others, including family members who may be more susceptible to severe consequences of the infection. Dr Johnston continued by saying: “In Northern Ireland, childhood vaccination programmes have consistently achieved high coverage and we hope that parents will be supportive of this roll out and get their child vaccinated. Vaccination is the most important thing we can do to protect ourselves and our children against ill-health. Evenyour child has already had COVID-, it is still important to get them vaccinated, as being fully-vaccinated can offer them the best protection from the virus and severe disease.” From Wednesday  March  you can make an appointment for your child at a children’s vaccination clinic in your local Health and Social Care Trust using the online booking system at:covid-.hscni.net get-vaccinated. You may be able to attend without an appointment. Dr Johnston concluded: “COVID- has not gone away. Getting vaccinated provides the best protection for both the child and their family. Children will need two doses of the vaccine, usually  weeks apart, to get longer-lasting protection. If your child has tested positive for COVID-, you should normally wait  weeks from the test for your child to have their first or second vaccine.” For further information for parents on the COVID- vaccine for  to  year olds visitpha.site all-s Or to find out where your nearest COVID- vaccine clinic is, visitvaccinations.covid-.hscni.net location-search  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_feabcdcbcf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebbdcfecead   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
