At least one of the singer\u0027s attorneys says he urged her repeatedly over the years to draft one.\u0027I tried to convince her that she should do not just a will but a trust while she was still alive,\u0027 says Don Wilson, a Los Angeles lawyer who worked on entertainment matters for Franklin for nearly 30 years. \u0027She never told me, \u0027No, I don\u0027t want to do one.\u0027 She understood the need. It just didn\u0027t seem to be something she got around to.\u0027Laura Zwicker, an attorney who specializes in estate planning but is not affiliated with the Franklin estate, says she sees it happen all too often in her work.\u0027People don\u0027t like to face their own mortality,\u0027 Zwicker says. \u0027I had a client who had a $70 million real estate portfolio who had had end-stage diabetes. He had plenty of conversations with me about estate planning but would not sign the documents.\u0027  She was not married and left four sons, ages 48 to 63: Clarence Franklin, Edward Franklin (pictured), Kecalf Franklin and Ted White Jr. Clarence, Aretha\u0027s eldest, is incapacitated and is represented by a guardianPapers filed in Michigan\u0027s Oakland County court last week by David J. Bennett, the lawyer who worked most closely with Franklin, lay out the few known basics:She was not married and left four sons, ages 48 to 63: Clarence Franklin, Edward Franklin, Kecalf Franklin and Ted White Jr. Clarence, Aretha\u0027s eldest, is incapacitated and is represented by a guardian. And a niece of hers has accepted the role of executor.  Family members embrace at Franklin\u0027s funeral. A niece of hers has accepted the role of executor Under Michigan law, as in most states, the sons will equally ide their mother\u0027s assets in the absence of a will, and so far no signs of conflict have emerged among family members. Bennett did not respond to phone and email messages seeking comment.Aretha Franklin\u0027s friend Ron Moten, a Michigan businessman, gave the four sons some guidance in his speech at Friday\u0027s funeral.\u0027Remember your family, and friends that have been with you for years,\u0027 Moten told the men. \u0027Because you are about to meet a lot of people who will now want to be your new best friend. You will also meet some people that will have the best investments in the world for you. My advice? Go slow, be careful and be smart.\u0027The documents make no mention of the value of Franklin\u0027s estate. The figure almost certainly runs into the tens of millions, but there will probably be widely varying estimates as her attorneys seek to downplay her wealth for tax purposes and the IRS tries to maximize the amount for its own reasons.Franklin maintained ownership of the songs she wrote and did well by them, Wilson says, though of her major hits, \u0027Think\u0027 is the only one that\u0027s her own composition. She also wrote some lesser hits, such as \u0027Rock Steady.\u0027  Jordan Franklin, left, pauses alongside his sister Victorie Franklin while speaking about their grandmother, Aretha Franklin. Documents make no mention of the value of Franklin\u0027s estateThough her records were played millions of times, she earned little in radio royalties from smashes like 1967\u0027s \u0027Respect\u0027 because such payments go overwhelmingly to the song\u0027s author, not the performer. In the case of \u0027Respect,\u0027 the royalties go to the estate of Otis Redding, even though the song owes nearly all its popularity to Franklin.\u0027I would imagine she probably felt she was entitled to more, but probably received more than a lot of artists from the time, especially African-American artists,\u0027 Wilson says.Among Franklin\u0027s more tangible assets are several pieces of property in the Detroit area that according to tax assessors\u0027 estimates are worth at least $2 million, with a market value that could easily be twice that.Star of Marvel\u0027s Luke Cage apologizes after appearing to...Bill Clinton is VERY impressed with mini-dress wearing...Share this article    Some heirs, like Franklin\u0027s son Clarence, may need more than others, and that can be a difficult and touchy decision for a parent   \u0027One arrangement may be fitting for one child, where other people need more help,\u0027 lawyer Laura Zwicker said. \u0027To accept that and put it on paper can be hard for a parent\u0027Once the value is established - a process that could take years - the IRS will take any back taxes Franklin owed, then will tax her estate at 40 percent for any assets beyond $11.2 million.Kenneth Abdo, an attorney who specializes in probate law and has worked on the estate of Prince, who also died without a will, says the IRS will conduct an audit of her holdings.Wilson, her entertainment attorney, says she would not have wanted to see her finances publicly aired: \u0027She was a private person.\u0027As for why some clients don\u0027t make out a will, Zwicker said some heirs, like Franklin\u0027s son Clarence, may need more than others, and that can be a difficult and touchy decision for a parent.\u0027One arrangement may be fitting for one child, where other people need more help,\u0027 Zwicker said. \u0027To accept that and put it on paper can be hard for a parent.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/15/4E32FB4100000578-0-image-m-59_1531493474914.jpg","title":"Britains Got Talent host Amanda Holden dogs womans best friend","story":"Amanda Holden, 47, shows off her sensational physique in...How to look this good at 47 without ever going on a diet:...Share this articleIt was love at first sight and Ruth says their long walks together are her ‘stress-reliever’ from hectic working life. ‘Stroking your dog releases stress – I totally believe it now.’SHIRLEY BALLAS: ‘MY POOCH FLIES FIRST-CLASS WITH ME’There’s no expense spared for the Strictly judge’s beloved pet (both pictured, below).

Drivers often receive less than the valuation offered online.In 2011 the now-defunct Office for Fair Trading took action against the website after finding that 96 per cent of customers received less than its valuation tool indicated. But it remains very popular among drivers who do not want the hassle of selling their car privately.The business model has helped generate a fortune for Mrs Palmer-Baunack andd she now joins an almost exclusively male list of executives who have found themselves embroiled in controversy over excessive pay.On top of her £29million bonus, linked to the company’s share price, she also received an 8 per cent rise in her basic salary to £525,000.In leaked emails seen by The Mail on Sunday, one former male colleague remarked that he might have been better off if he had a ‘pair of **** like Avril’.Shareholders have also been encouraged to vote against the bonus scheme, with a report by advisory firm Glass Lewis calling the £29million pay-out ‘extremely disproportionate’.The board faces a showdown with investors at its AGM in London on Thursday.Victory for Johnny Bobbitt: Couple, accused of stealing...Freeway of Love! 130 pink Cadillacs owners come from all...Homeware giant Robert Dyas BANS sales of £2.99 caustic soda...Schoolchildren will be BANNED from buying energy drinks: PM...Share this articleBut the vote is only advisory, meaning she can keep her bonus – unless she feels obliged to appease shareholders.Given her hard-nosed reflections on executive pay and the workplace, that seems unlikely.Mrs Palmer-Baunack, who has a grown-up son and daughter, is married to a German executive at Volkswagen. She previously defended her £7.1million pay package in 2015 by saying: ‘Anyone who says they don’t want money is talking b*******’.The former Saturday girl at Marks \u0026amp Spencer has also shown little sympathy with the idea that women are discriminated against in the workplace.She once said she was ‘very cynical’ about the existence of ‘glass ceilings’ – a term describing the reluctance by companies to give top jobs to women. In an interview two years ago she said: ‘If you get up and do a good day’s work, you are respected for it.’During her first full-time job at a car rental desk in Kennington, South London, she realised she was good at selling and that the job was ‘all about up-selling everything’. ‘Upselling’ means persuading customers to buy extras or more expensive items.          On top of her £29million bonus, linked to the company’s share price, Avril Palmer-Baunack also received an 8 per cent rise in her basic salary to £525,000.British Car Auctions has defended her remuneration, arguing it needs to pay a ‘competitive rate’ to attract top people. But MPs are likely to take a dim view. Theresa May has published a public register to name and shame firms which have faced a revolt from shareholders over high pay.More than a fifth of Britain’s FTSE listed-firms appear on the list, including Burberry, Sports Direct and Sky.Earlier this year the chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon announced he would hand back £25million of his £100million pay package, to pacify shareholders.The award for Jeff Fairburn was generated by a 2012 long-term incentive plan. However, Mrs Palmer-Baunack’s haul is dwarfed by Denise Coates, who founded private online gambling firm Bet365 in 2000 from a Portakabin in a Stoke car park.The billionaire awarded herself £217million in pay and idends in 2016. That is about 1,400 times more than the Prime Minister.One of the few highly paid female bosses of firms listed on the stockmarket is Emma Walmsley.

Today, he describes how he and his BBC cameraman went in search of the rarest animal of all . . . Our footsteps echoed with embarrassing loudness on the hotel lobby’s polished wooden floor. There seemed to be nobody about. We coughed apologetically and waited.My cameraman colleague, Geoff Mulligan, and I had been warned that hardly anybody stayed at this hotel — why would they, situated as it was deep in the inhospitable forests of eastern Madagascar? But it seemed the perfect place to base ourselves in our search for one of the island’s most elusive creatures: its largest lemur, the indri.After several minutes a door at the far end of the hall opened to reveal, to our astonishment, an extremely glamorous woman. Her lips were heavily reddened and her lashes blackened with mascara, and she wore a chic but flimsy silk housecoat that barely succeeded in covering her ample figure.She was not yet fully awake, though it was by then almost midday. As she tottered towards us on stylish high heels, she was blinking sleepily and doing her best to rearrange her upswept coiffure.Jeanine, as we were to discover later, was no ordinary hotel boss — she had once been a model and the proprietor of a fashionable bar in Madagascar’s capital, Tananarive, which she had been forced to leave because of what she darkly referred to as ‘un grand scandale’.She required a great deal of reassurance that we had not come to the area by mistake, but were hoping to book rooms for a fortnight or so. When we at last convinced her, we unloaded our belongings and went to meet the local forestry officer, an elderly Frenchman.Our conversation was not profitable as he was lacking his dentures, and my French is passable at best. But he kindly offered us the services of a deputy, Michel, to show us the areas most likely to harbour the rare, mysterious and beautiful indri.I had read as much as I possibly could about this extraordinary animal before I left Britain, and established that it is around 3ft tall, is coloured black or black-and-white and has huge hands, six times as long as they are broad.What intrigued me most was the resemblance it bore to ancient drawings of a creature known to early explorers as the ‘dog-headed man’ peculiar to the area. It was always depicted as standing upright, with a shaggy coat and enormous, human-like hands and feet. Its body was tail-less and proportioned like a human being’s, but with a face and a snout like a dog’s.Could the ‘dog-headed man’ be the indri?There were few eyewitness accounts — the one attempt to study it in captivity 20 years before had failed dismally. A group of indris sent to a Paris zoo all died within a month, the keepers having been unable to replicate their highly specialised diet of leaves.Now here we were, with the chance to see one for ourselves. To watch and film one would, for me, be a glittering prize well worth all the effort and anticipation.As Geoff and I followed Michel into the twilight of the rainforest, our spirits sank.This was the thickest bush we had encountered so far. Not only was it very dark, but the vegetation was so dense that unless we were lucky it would be impossible to get a filmable view of any creature more than a few feet away.But the forest was extremely rich in animal life. From a small stream nearby came the honk of frogs, while from overhead came a confused chorus of birdsong.As I stood trying to unravel this cacophony, the birdsong was suddenly drowned out by a chorus of spine-chilling, unearthly howls.          Indri (pictured), also called the babakoto, is the largest lemurs of Madagascar‘Babakoto,’ said Michel, triumphantly — the local word for the indri. The noise was deafening — and eerily like the sound of a crying human child. But nothing could have prepared me for the volume. Even a gang of the noisiest children could not have produced a tenth of these decibels.Desperately, we peered through the palisades of trunks and leafy curtains. But we could see nothing — not the tiniest patch of black fur, nor the flash of an eye.Then, as abruptly as the wailing had begun, it stopped and the crickets, frogs and parrots took over once again. We were jubilant — the indris were really here.‘Always they sing at the same time,’ said Michel. ‘They will be here again tomorrow. If they don’t sing, then call to them with their voice, and often they will reply.’We turned up the next day with all our equipment, and the next, and the next. But of the indris there was neither sight nor sound. Hour after hour we waited, doing our best to imitate their calls. But no reply came back from the trees. There seemed nothing else to do but be patient.After a week, I was beginning to lose faith in the possibility of ever seeing an indri. Had they moved on? We decided to try a different part of the bush.Our first foray provided almost immediately a minor success, albeit not the one we had anticipated. Looking down to see where I was putting my feet, I noticed I was about to step into the middle of a collection of shiny olive-green objects the size of golf balls.When I picked one up, a split opened on one side to reveal that it was in fact a huge insect with around 20 pairs of frantically waving legs. The creature straightened itself out, unfurled a pair of knobbly antennae and began walking determinedly up my arm.I identified it as one of a strange species of millipede and I was sure they would make a wonderful display in London Zoo’s insect house. We filled our pockets and took 100 or so back to the hotel.The millipedes were not our only acquisition. A few days later, the elderly forestry officer drew up at the hotel in his smart saloon car.He was on his way to a meeting, but en-route had met some men carrying a newly-caught tailless tenrec — a comical, spiny creature looking like a cross between a hedgehog and an anteater.Remembering us, he had given the men a few francs for the animal and, as he had no cage or sack handy, had put it loose in the boot of his car. It was, he said, extremely lively and ferocious.Mindful of this, we assembled gloves, sacks and an empty cage, and the forestry officer cautiously lifted the boot lid an inch. I peered inside but could see nothing.He widened the crack two inches, then, warning us to pounce swiftly, threw open the lid. Geoff and I lunged. But there was absolutely nothing upon which to pounce. The boot was empty!Gingerly we removed the tool-bag, the jack and the spare wheel. Again, nothing. As we wondered what to do next, we heard a scrabbling deep inside the chassis somewhere between the front and back mudguards.\u0027We didn’t know we were playing with the clothes of Dad’s...Share this articleBy this time we had drawn a crowd of curious onlookers, and there was no lack of helping hands when I suggested that unscrewing the panels lining the interior was the only way to reach our quarry.The invisible tenrec spurred us on by rattling about in his metallic cavern.The forestry officer was starting to weary of the sight of his car being dismantled, and proposed driving on to his meeting.I pointed out that this would be most unwise, as the poor creature would almost certainly die — and if it did the smell would make his car unusable for at least a week.A far better plan would be to shut the lid, join us for coffee and see if the tenrec would clamber out of its uncomfortable refuge in the chassis and return to the relative spaciousness of the boot.Two hours later, we quietly opened the lid again. The tenrec was sitting at the back nonchalantly washing himself. He was the size of a large guinea pig, with an absurdly long tapering nose, immense whiskers, beady eyes and enormous hindquarters.We pounced and seconds later he was in one of our travelling cages.By the time we got him back to London and handed him over to the Zoo he had grown tremendously, increasing in both girth and length. But he never lost his passion for trying to cram his paunchy body down even the smallest suspicion of a hole.My hotel room was now well stocked. Chameleons sat goggling at one another on the curtain rail. A frilled gecko hung upside down on a piece of bark in a cage next to the tenrec. The millipedes slumbered in a box in one corner and three boa constrictors occupied a slowly moving sack in the other.          David with cameraman Geoff MulliganEvery day we discovered fresh creatures to fascinate us: moths, beetles, snakes, lizards, black parrots, strange frogs — but we still had not found the indri.An Ornithologist friend had asked us to record the song of the Madagascan magpie robin — a sound he considered to be among the finest produced by any bird.Geoff and I made our first attempt one day soon after dawn. When we arrived we found one, a handsome cock bird, singing heartily. Quickly, I plugged in the microphone and aimed it at him.For several minutes the tape moved steadily. Then, suddenly, a deafening eerie wail pealed out from the trees beyond, so loud that the recorder needle thrashed against the stop pin of the dial and clung there shuddering. It was the indri. But this time it was louder and closer.Geoff snatched his camera and I frantically searched the trees, but we could see nothing. The calls stopped, and I caught a momentary glimpse of a body sailing through the air. The indri had gone. Once more, we had failed.‘Well,’ said Geoff as we trudged back for breakfast. ‘At least we have a recording to prove it does exist, and that once upon a time we were within a few yards of one.’Then I thought of a trick used by ornithologists to locate a bird they wish to study — playing a recording of its song to attract others. I didn’t have much confidence, but we had tried everything else.For the next few days we played Geoff’s recording in several parts of the forest with no luck. Then, one morning I was about to pack up when the sound of the tape was suddenly drowned out by a series of trumpeting hoots.They were unlike any animal sound I’d ever heard, and I couldn’t imagine what was making them.I looked up and saw one of the hooting creatures in a tree in a small dell nearby — a big, furry black-and-white lemur, sitting on a branch 30ft from the ground.His chest, forearms and legs below the knee were white and he appeared to have a black cape round his shoulders, a pure white cap and black socks and gloves.‘It’s a ruffed lemur,’ I whispered to Geoff. ‘We can get shots of them in Tananarive Zoo.’ Nonetheless, we started filming, for he was a most beautiful creature.Our tape recorder continued its indri wails. The lemur glared indignantly at us with bright yellow eyes. Once more he hooted his irritation, and another trumpeting sound came from a tree on the left. I turned and saw two more of the animals sitting with their necks craned forward, staring at us in puzzlement.The first one reached up and pulled himself upright on to the branch above. I made a mental note that his movements were not like those of other lemurs, which are all four-footed. Then, as the animal sat down once more, I blinked in surprise.‘Where’s he put his tail?’ I muttered. ‘He should have a very long, black one.’‘Perhaps it’s curled up between his legs,’ said Geoff.The animal raised a long hind leg and grasped the tree trunk. He did not have a tail. Stupidly, it took me a few seconds to reach the only possible conclusion. ‘Geoff,’ I said quietly, ‘that is an indri.’There was no doubt. There is only one tailless lemur. We were jubilant. We had found them — and Geoff had already shot a full 400ft of film.Cautiously, he moved nearer to get shots from a different angle, but it was too much for the indris. With a gigantic bound, the first one leapt away, springing from trunk to trunk so rapidly that he seemed to ricochet from one tree to the other. The other two followed and within seconds were out of sight.Before dawn we returned and there they were again, just as Michel had said they would be. Every day for a week we watched this little family: the big male, his mate and a younger pair, slowly getting to know their habits, routine and personalities.The old male was of a sedate disposition, often sitting on a branch with his back against the main trunk and his long legs outstretched in a comically human-like position. Although he could leap huge distances, he spent most of his time clambering happily from branch to branch in search of the most succulent young leaves.The two youngsters were an extremely affectionate couple, and spent hours each day caressing one another. The position they chose in which to practise their endearments, crouching on a high horizontal bough, seemed perilous, like a pair of circus acrobats nonchalantly enacting episodes of their daily lives on a high wire.The fourth member of the group, the older female, we seldom saw. Only after several days did we learn the reason for her reticence. Clinging to her back was small, black-faced baby with hairy ears and bright eyes, barely a foot long.He was an enchanting creature, sometimes riding on her back, sometimes clambering round to suckle. His mother behaved with endearing tenderness, licking him gently from time to time.Our detailed knowledge of the family’s daily routine made our task of filming them easy. We photographed them feeding, dozing and caressing one another, but one shot we lacked — we had not secured any good pictures of them leaping, for when they moved off they always jumped away from us.If we were to get the film we wanted before we left, we urgently needed a new approach.We knew the location of the tree where they sang at lunchtime, and that they moved to an area further away to sing in the late afternoon. To get from one to the other, the indris would have to cross one of the area’s few wide roads.Retracing their movements, we worked out that at only one place was the road narrow enough for them to leap comfortably across. A simple calculation was enough to show that they must make the crossing at between three and four o’clock in the afternoon.Accordingly, at half-past two, Geoff and I set up our cameras a little west of the trees we judged they would use for their leap.Prompt at half past three, the old male duly appeared in the take-off tree. The young couple joined him, then the mother and baby emerged from the forest behind to sit on one of the branches overhanging the road.As soon as they were assembled, the old male climbed leisurely to the most outstretched branch. Geoff began filming.The male poised himself, then made a single, soaring jump right across the road to the tree the other side. One by one the rest followed him and disappeared.Geoff switched off his camera, beaming. After weeks of hope and crushing disappointment, our film of the private life of the indris was complete at last.Were the creatures we had filmed really the origin of the dog-headed man? It was impossible to know. But of one thing I was certain. Of all the strange and wonderful creatures we had filmed in Madagascar, this was the rarest, the least documented and the most endearing.  Aware of the BBC’s team’s disappointment at not being permitted to catch any lemurs, the Madagascar Scientific Institute presented them with two ring-tails and a ruffed lemur from its own collection. Their descendants thrived at London Zoo for decades.The indri remains in critical danger of extinction, with a 2015 report revealing that no zoo has yet worked out the complexities of its diet, and that it is unable to breed in captivity.Adapted from Journeys To The Other Side Of The World: Further Adventures Of A Young Naturalist by Sir David Attenborough, published by Two Roads on September 6 at £25. © David Attenborough 2018.

The great land battles were being remembered at a number of ceremonies as the dates occurred,\u0027 writes Macdonald. \u0027The great clash of steel titans at sea, the Battle of Jutland, was poignantly remembered, as were the inidual sinkings of some famous ships such as HMS Hampshire and HMS Vanguard. \u0027But for many ships and their crews, sent to the bottom by mine, torpedo or collision, there was no such act of remembrance. Now, therefore, as these great 100th anniversaries passed, it seemed an appropriate time to write about some of the famous World War I naval shipwrecks that lie around our British coastline, in my own act of remembrance to those who perished.\u0027The Rio de Janeiro Maru was requisitioned by the Japanese Navy and was active until September 1943 when she was reconverted into a transport ship, however, in February 1944, she was bombed during Operation Hailstone by the USA.              Crockery found in the Helmet Wreck bears generic markings of an eagle on top of a globe          A er swimming alongside the bronze lettering which still rings around the Rio de Janeiro Maru\u0027s stern          Paul Haynes carefully holds a katana samurai sword found inside the Rio de Janeiro Maru in Truk Lagoon          Rod Macdonald and Paul Haynes with the bell of British Steam Ship SS Creemuir which was sunk as it made its way north along the East Coast of Scotland by German aircraft          Rod  left, and Paul, right,  fly the flag of the Explorers Club, a group which promotes the scientific exploration of land, sea, air, and space          The stern of Audacious, the first British battleship to be sunk by an enemy attack during World War One  The images have been released as part of a new book by Rod who is an internationally renowned Scotish er, called Deeper into the Darkness: The Diving Trilogy 3Macdonald has previously written about some of the greatest shipwrecks around the UK and his latest book also charts his own journey from novice to technical er as well as highlighting the history of some of the world\u0027s greatest wrecks.\u0027I decided to write a follow-on to Into the Abyss and The Darkness Below - a third volume in the story of my ing career, which by complete chance, mirrors and charts the development of our sport of technical ing from its origins in the dangerous deep air days of the late 1980s, through concepts such as extended range ing, the use of decompression gases such as nitrox, the use of deep ing trimix gases using helium, through open-circuit trimix ing and on to the present day, when we use amazingly complicated closed-circuit rebreathers that greatly extend the time you can spend on the bottom and the depth you can go to with ease, whilst minimising as far as possible the length of time it takes to ascend safely and decompress,\u0027 continues Macdonald.\u0027Of necessity, reading about ing, and particularly technical ing, means grappling with a number of specialist concepts and pieces of kit that can seem confusing and daunting to the non-er to begin with.\u0027Rather than providing a dull glossary, each time something specialist comes up for the first time I\u0027ve tried to explain it in simple terms so that as you progress through the book, these concepts and pieces of kit will become more familiar.\u0027Don\u0027t worry if you don\u0027t understand something at a first reading you will by the end of the book.

Today, he describes how he and his BBC cameraman went in search of the rarest animal of all . . . Our footsteps echoed with embarrassing loudness on the hotel lobby’s polished wooden floor. There seemed to be nobody about. We coughed apologetically and waited.My cameraman colleague, Geoff Mulligan, and I had been warned that hardly anybody stayed at this hotel — why would they, situated as it was deep in the inhospitable forests of eastern Madagascar? But it seemed the perfect place to base ourselves in our search for one of the island’s most elusive creatures: its largest lemur, the indri.After several minutes a door at the far end of the hall opened to reveal, to our astonishment, an extremely glamorous woman. Her lips were heavily reddened and her lashes blackened with mascara, and she wore a chic but flimsy silk housecoat that barely succeeded in covering her ample figure.She was not yet fully awake, though it was by then almost midday. As she tottered towards us on stylish high heels, she was blinking sleepily and doing her best to rearrange her upswept coiffure.Jeanine, as we were to discover later, was no ordinary hotel boss — she had once been a model and the proprietor of a fashionable bar in Madagascar’s capital, Tananarive, which she had been forced to leave because of what she darkly referred to as ‘un grand scandale’.She required a great deal of reassurance that we had not come to the area by mistake, but were hoping to book rooms for a fortnight or so. When we at last convinced her, we unloaded our belongings and went to meet the local forestry officer, an elderly Frenchman.Our conversation was not profitable as he was lacking his dentures, and my French is passable at best. But he kindly offered us the services of a deputy, Michel, to show us the areas most likely to harbour the rare, mysterious and beautiful indri.I had read as much as I possibly could about this extraordinary animal before I left Britain, and established that it is around 3ft tall, is coloured black or black-and-white and has huge hands, six times as long as they are broad.What intrigued me most was the resemblance it bore to ancient drawings of a creature known to early explorers as the ‘dog-headed man’ peculiar to the area. It was always depicted as standing upright, with a shaggy coat and enormous, human-like hands and feet. Its body was tail-less and proportioned like a human being’s, but with a face and a snout like a dog’s.Could the ‘dog-headed man’ be the indri?There were few eyewitness accounts — the one attempt to study it in captivity 20 years before had failed dismally. A group of indris sent to a Paris zoo all died within a month, the keepers having been unable to replicate their highly specialised diet of leaves.Now here we were, with the chance to see one for ourselves. To watch and film one would, for me, be a glittering prize well worth all the effort and anticipation.As Geoff and I followed Michel into the twilight of the rainforest, our spirits sank.This was the thickest bush we had encountered so far. Not only was it very dark, but the vegetation was so dense that unless we were lucky it would be impossible to get a filmable view of any creature more than a few feet away.But the forest was extremely rich in animal life. From a small stream nearby came the honk of frogs, while from overhead came a confused chorus of birdsong.As I stood trying to unravel this cacophony, the birdsong was suddenly drowned out by a chorus of spine-chilling, unearthly howls.          Indri (pictured), also called the babakoto, is the largest lemurs of Madagascar‘Babakoto,’ said Michel, triumphantly — the local word for the indri. The noise was deafening — and eerily like the sound of a crying human child. But nothing could have prepared me for the volume. Even a gang of the noisiest children could not have produced a tenth of these decibels.Desperately, we peered through the palisades of trunks and leafy curtains. But we could see nothing — not the tiniest patch of black fur, nor the flash of an eye.Then, as abruptly as the wailing had begun, it stopped and the crickets, frogs and parrots took over once again. We were jubilant — the indris were really here.‘Always they sing at the same time,’ said Michel. ‘They will be here again tomorrow. If they don’t sing, then call to them with their voice, and often they will reply.’We turned up the next day with all our equipment, and the next, and the next. But of the indris there was neither sight nor sound. Hour after hour we waited, doing our best to imitate their calls. But no reply came back from the trees. There seemed nothing else to do but be patient.After a week, I was beginning to lose faith in the possibility of ever seeing an indri. Had they moved on? We decided to try a different part of the bush.Our first foray provided almost immediately a minor success, albeit not the one we had anticipated. Looking down to see where I was putting my feet, I noticed I was about to step into the middle of a collection of shiny olive-green objects the size of golf balls.When I picked one up, a split opened on one side to reveal that it was in fact a huge insect with around 20 pairs of frantically waving legs. The creature straightened itself out, unfurled a pair of knobbly antennae and began walking determinedly up my arm.I identified it as one of a strange species of millipede and I was sure they would make a wonderful display in London Zoo’s insect house. We filled our pockets and took 100 or so back to the hotel.The millipedes were not our only acquisition. A few days later, the elderly forestry officer drew up at the hotel in his smart saloon car.He was on his way to a meeting, but en-route had met some men carrying a newly-caught tailless tenrec — a comical, spiny creature looking like a cross between a hedgehog and an anteater.Remembering us, he had given the men a few francs for the animal and, as he had no cage or sack handy, had put it loose in the boot of his car. It was, he said, extremely lively and ferocious.Mindful of this, we assembled gloves, sacks and an empty cage, and the forestry officer cautiously lifted the boot lid an inch. I peered inside but could see nothing.He widened the crack two inches, then, warning us to pounce swiftly, threw open the lid. Geoff and I lunged. But there was absolutely nothing upon which to pounce. The boot was empty!Gingerly we removed the tool-bag, the jack and the spare wheel. Again, nothing. As we wondered what to do next, we heard a scrabbling deep inside the chassis somewhere between the front and back mudguards.\u0027We didn’t know we were playing with the clothes of Dad’s...Share this articleBy this time we had drawn a crowd of curious onlookers, and there was no lack of helping hands when I suggested that unscrewing the panels lining the interior was the only way to reach our quarry.The invisible tenrec spurred us on by rattling about in his metallic cavern.The forestry officer was starting to weary of the sight of his car being dismantled, and proposed driving on to his meeting.I pointed out that this would be most unwise, as the poor creature would almost certainly die — and if it did the smell would make his car unusable for at least a week.A far better plan would be to shut the lid, join us for coffee and see if the tenrec would clamber out of its uncomfortable refuge in the chassis and return to the relative spaciousness of the boot.Two hours later, we quietly opened the lid again. The tenrec was sitting at the back nonchalantly washing himself. He was the size of a large guinea pig, with an absurdly long tapering nose, immense whiskers, beady eyes and enormous hindquarters.We pounced and seconds later he was in one of our travelling cages.By the time we got him back to London and handed him over to the Zoo he had grown tremendously, increasing in both girth and length. But he never lost his passion for trying to cram his paunchy body down even the smallest suspicion of a hole.My hotel room was now well stocked. Chameleons sat goggling at one another on the curtain rail. A frilled gecko hung upside down on a piece of bark in a cage next to the tenrec. The millipedes slumbered in a box in one corner and three boa constrictors occupied a slowly moving sack in the other.          David with cameraman Geoff MulliganEvery day we discovered fresh creatures to fascinate us: moths, beetles, snakes, lizards, black parrots, strange frogs — but we still had not found the indri.An Ornithologist friend had asked us to record the song of the Madagascan magpie robin — a sound he considered to be among the finest produced by any bird.Geoff and I made our first attempt one day soon after dawn. When we arrived we found one, a handsome cock bird, singing heartily. Quickly, I plugged in the microphone and aimed it at him.For several minutes the tape moved steadily. Then, suddenly, a deafening eerie wail pealed out from the trees beyond, so loud that the recorder needle thrashed against the stop pin of the dial and clung there shuddering. It was the indri. But this time it was louder and closer.Geoff snatched his camera and I frantically searched the trees, but we could see nothing. The calls stopped, and I caught a momentary glimpse of a body sailing through the air. The indri had gone. Once more, we had failed.‘Well,’ said Geoff as we trudged back for breakfast. ‘At least we have a recording to prove it does exist, and that once upon a time we were within a few yards of one.’Then I thought of a trick used by ornithologists to locate a bird they wish to study — playing a recording of its song to attract others. I didn’t have much confidence, but we had tried everything else.For the next few days we played Geoff’s recording in several parts of the forest with no luck. Then, one morning I was about to pack up when the sound of the tape was suddenly drowned out by a series of trumpeting hoots.They were unlike any animal sound I’d ever heard, and I couldn’t imagine what was making them.I looked up and saw one of the hooting creatures in a tree in a small dell nearby — a big, furry black-and-white lemur, sitting on a branch 30ft from the ground.His chest, forearms and legs below the knee were white and he appeared to have a black cape round his shoulders, a pure white cap and black socks and gloves.‘It’s a ruffed lemur,’ I whispered to Geoff. ‘We can get shots of them in Tananarive Zoo.’ Nonetheless, we started filming, for he was a most beautiful creature.Our tape recorder continued its indri wails. The lemur glared indignantly at us with bright yellow eyes. Once more he hooted his irritation, and another trumpeting sound came from a tree on the left. I turned and saw two more of the animals sitting with their necks craned forward, staring at us in puzzlement.The first one reached up and pulled himself upright on to the branch above. I made a mental note that his movements were not like those of other lemurs, which are all four-footed. Then, as the animal sat down once more, I blinked in surprise.‘Where’s he put his tail?’ I muttered. ‘He should have a very long, black one.’‘Perhaps it’s curled up between his legs,’ said Geoff.The animal raised a long hind leg and grasped the tree trunk. He did not have a tail. Stupidly, it took me a few seconds to reach the only possible conclusion. ‘Geoff,’ I said quietly, ‘that is an indri.’There was no doubt. There is only one tailless lemur. We were jubilant. We had found them — and Geoff had already shot a full 400ft of film.Cautiously, he moved nearer to get shots from a different angle, but it was too much for the indris. With a gigantic bound, the first one leapt away, springing from trunk to trunk so rapidly that he seemed to ricochet from one tree to the other. The other two followed and within seconds were out of sight.Before dawn we returned and there they were again, just as Michel had said they would be. Every day for a week we watched this little family: the big male, his mate and a younger pair, slowly getting to know their habits, routine and personalities.The old male was of a sedate disposition, often sitting on a branch with his back against the main trunk and his long legs outstretched in a comically human-like position. Although he could leap huge distances, he spent most of his time clambering happily from branch to branch in search of the most succulent young leaves.The two youngsters were an extremely affectionate couple, and spent hours each day caressing one another. The position they chose in which to practise their endearments, crouching on a high horizontal bough, seemed perilous, like a pair of circus acrobats nonchalantly enacting episodes of their daily lives on a high wire.The fourth member of the group, the older female, we seldom saw. Only after several days did we learn the reason for her reticence. Clinging to her back was small, black-faced baby with hairy ears and bright eyes, barely a foot long.He was an enchanting creature, sometimes riding on her back, sometimes clambering round to suckle. His mother behaved with endearing tenderness, licking him gently from time to time.Our detailed knowledge of the family’s daily routine made our task of filming them easy. We photographed them feeding, dozing and caressing one another, but one shot we lacked — we had not secured any good pictures of them leaping, for when they moved off they always jumped away from us.If we were to get the film we wanted before we left, we urgently needed a new approach.We knew the location of the tree where they sang at lunchtime, and that they moved to an area further away to sing in the late afternoon. To get from one to the other, the indris would have to cross one of the area’s few wide roads.Retracing their movements, we worked out that at only one place was the road narrow enough for them to leap comfortably across. A simple calculation was enough to show that they must make the crossing at between three and four o’clock in the afternoon.Accordingly, at half-past two, Geoff and I set up our cameras a little west of the trees we judged they would use for their leap.Prompt at half past three, the old male duly appeared in the take-off tree. The young couple joined him, then the mother and baby emerged from the forest behind to sit on one of the branches overhanging the road.As soon as they were assembled, the old male climbed leisurely to the most outstretched branch. Geoff began filming.The male poised himself, then made a single, soaring jump right across the road to the tree the other side. One by one the rest followed him and disappeared.Geoff switched off his camera, beaming. After weeks of hope and crushing disappointment, our film of the private life of the indris was complete at last.Were the creatures we had filmed really the origin of the dog-headed man? It was impossible to know. But of one thing I was certain. Of all the strange and wonderful creatures we had filmed in Madagascar, this was the rarest, the least documented and the most endearing.  Aware of the BBC’s team’s disappointment at not being permitted to catch any lemurs, the Madagascar Scientific Institute presented them with two ring-tails and a ruffed lemur from its own collection. Their descendants thrived at London Zoo for decades.The indri remains in critical danger of extinction, with a 2015 report revealing that no zoo has yet worked out the complexities of its diet, and that it is unable to breed in captivity.Adapted from Journeys To The Other Side Of The World: Further Adventures Of A Young Naturalist by Sir David Attenborough, published by Two Roads on September 6 at £25. © David Attenborough 2018.

Mr Morgan claimed the magazine was \u0027doing it for click baits and get Cosmo talked about\u0027, before adding: \u0027You are celebrating morbid obesity\u0027\u0027I’ve see her run around with her children, she works 14 to 15 hours a day.\u0027Mr Morgan claimed the magazine was \u0027doing it for click baits and get Cosmo talked about\u0027, before adding: \u0027You are celebrating morbid obesity\u0027.Mrs Stoor replied: \u0027Am I saying that this is OK to look like?

During the debate, Shameless and Brookside star Tina Malone (right), who lost 12 stone and 4 pounds, revealed she started missing out on work due to her weight loss\u0027She is representing to them an image that isn’t right.

Sara Cox hopefully will step in.\u0027Another added: \u0027If Sara Cox doesn\u0027t permanently take over from Chris Evans when he leaves then you\u0027re missing a huge trick!

They were once part of a migrating community of reindeer herders but today, in their old age, they spend most of their days in the village of Yar-Sale, cut off from their nomadic relatives and friends.Though the men are encouraged to stay within the wandering community as they grow older, the women often find themselves facing the struggles of ageing in isolation.Life in the village might seem more comfortable than life as a migrating elder in the wild tundra, but it comes at the cost of great loneliness and a loss of purpose. In the past, each woman held an essential role in her community. Pudani, for example, was a leading herder, while Liliya was the only person in her tribe who knew how to read. Over many cups of tea, these women shared their life stories. They told me about magical snowy landscapes, lost parents and partners.  I asked each woman for permission to take their portrait in the natural light of their homes and wearing a precious item from their past. Using their stories as a guide, I also documented the wild landscapes they once wandered.Autipana Audi (born 1941). During her lifetime, Autipana experienced many sad losses. She lost her husband, son and daughter to diseases, and a few years ago her entire reindeer herd perished to starvation during a cold wave. Almost unable to walk, she spends her days mostly limited to her bed. Autipana, who was born in the tundra, says that “walking in the snow” is what she longs for most.Necla Audi (born 1928). Although Necla was 89 when this portrait was taken, she still wishes to live with the migrating community. “I was born in the tundra and spent all my life there, it’s the only way of living I know.” At the far left of her bed is a picture of her two sons taken when they were young. Now, both of them are herders in the tundra.Angelina Serotetto (born 1942). Angelina was part of a family of shaman women and her mother taught her to read the future using sacred objects from nature. “Yes! I miss those days in the past,” she says. “But I try to remain optimistic. I view everything with a loving eye. I think you learn it as you get older”. Vaynoto Vera (born 1967). Having living in nature throughout her entire life, Vaynoto’s daughters rented her a small apartment in the village of Yar-Sale so that she could live in comfort. They come to visit her whenever possible but as they are obliged to return to their herds and migrating journeys, Vaynoto is often left alone.Zinaida Evay (born 1946) and her cat Persik (“peach” in Russian). Zinaida was married for many years, and she shared with me that she had a beautiful and loving bond with her husband, right to his last day. Now that he has passed away she is living in a small apartment alone, with their mutual cats, with almost no friends to come and visit. “All that is left are the lullabies I sing to myself.” Liliya Yamkina (born 1944). As a child she was the only one in her clan who knew how to read. She said she still remembers how important she felt when she read everyone their letters and formal documents. However, the importance of her reading skills to the clan was also the reason that her father prevented her from going to college and that caused many conflicts between them. Now, in her apartment, she writes love songs about the Tundra and her dream is to publish them in a magazine. “I did not fully understand the importance of tradition and family when I was young. I argued so much with my parents. I wanted to escape from my roots.” But, she adds: “I remember how much I liked it when they told me folk tales around the bonfire. I miss them so much.”Pudani Audi (born 1948). Like her ancestors who have wandered the frozen landscape of northern Siberia for thousands of years, Pudani was born in the tundra and roamed since birth. During her adulthood, she was a leading herder, leading the precious herd through one of the most extreme environments on earth. She told me that she is still hoping to return to wander, but without her community’s support it is clear that this longing will never be realised. In this portrait, she is wearing a fur hat, the sole object she was left with from her wandering days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d0dc8b48c916a244b1365d13d4b6c0f1abfc5cc/0_252_7346_4409/master/7346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe00047f64604218bf43696b07b7bf95","title":"i object ian hislop search for dissent review british museum","story":"British Museum, LondonThe Private Eye editor has scoured history in search of objects and images that express dissent. But where’s the satire?You know a joke’s in trouble when the audience needs to be told to laugh. Canned laughter would probably be going too far in a British Museum exhibition, so instead an enormous speech bubble, placed next to an 18th-century portrait of Louis XVI wearing a red liberty cap, gives us Ian Hislop’s assurance that it is funny.“The saying ‘Ridicule kills’ is usually an exaggeration,” says the Private Eye editor. “Not for Louis XVI. They have taken a well-known picture of the king and shoved a revolutionary hat on it. The effect is comical as the great Louis XVI is made to look as if he is a supporter of the revolution. Not so funny for him though.”It’s not so funny for anyone. This is a political image from a lost place and time. If it was ever intended to be humorous, that humour has long gone. And anyway, is there actually a saying “Ridicule kills”?But perhaps it’s asking too much of an exhibition that scours world history in search of objects and images that express “dissent” to be full of gags. Just because Hislop is famous as a satirist, why should we expect an exhibition billed as “Ian Hislop’s Search for Dissent” to be a comedy rollercoaster? Still, I Object is joyless in the extreme.Near the Jacobin picture of Louis XVI is a pink woollen Pussyhat that was worn on a Women’s March in January last year. With its pointy knitted ears, it is a sartorial riposte to Donald Trump’s sleazy remarks which came to light during his campaign for the US presidency. On a march, this must have been a powerful bit of headgear, just as it must have been stirring to see the Paris crowd all in red liberty caps in 1789. In this exhibition, however, it is shown on a mannequin head in a glass case with a label that sombrely alludes to Trump’s use of misogynist language. It has the street life crushed out of it.That text on the Pussyhat is not one of Hislop’s remarks. As is carefully explained at the start of the show, his words are in speech bubbles to distinguish them from the museum’s official labels. It all adds up to a lot of reading. What with that and the strait-laced presentation of objects in cases, this exhibition creates the opposite of a subversive mood. It bangs on about dissent in an almost authoritarian way.Worse, it takes this didactic line without making a convincing case that its theme even exists as a single global thread. What is dissent? In Britain, this word started out as a term for radical religious minorities and became a political word partly because they were associated with political protest. That’s one example of the infinite local contexts and nuances this show ignores. How can you speak of dissent in the abstract? People protest against, mock or subvert authority not just in very different ways but for different reasons. Authority itself takes different forms. This show insists that somehow it’s all the same impulse. That flattens history.At the start of the show, we see an obscene ancient Egyptian image. Hislop claims it is satirising the pharaohs but it could also be a fertility image or just a bit of fun. Or perhaps, if they allowed their artists to make rude jokes, the pharaohs weren’t that bad. Equally implausible is the claim that a late 18th-century coin defaced with an image of the pope being hanged is supporting Napoleon. Maybe – but there was also a savage Protestant popular culture that exploded in the Gordon Riots in the same era. Is hating Catholics a dissenting view?A large part of this show is taken up by indirect, hidden messages, for as Hislop says in another speech bubble: “For most of history in most places dissent was dangerous.” The trouble is, indirect subversion makes for a dreary display. Anyone expecting a raucous, riotous gathering of protest art may be disappointed by a case full of Catholic religious images that were buried to save them in the Reformation. There’s nothing subversive about these holy images in themselves.It is similarly hard to see the subversion in a ravishingly beautiful 14th-century Chinese painting called The Fascination of Nature. We’re told its creator, Xie Chufang, is commenting on the destruction of China’s culture by the Mongol invaders in his richly observed depiction of insects and amphibians preying on vegetation. All I can see is a marvellous portrayal of nature.When we actually get to see some explicitly dissenting, joyously rebellious art, the exhibition momentarily flares into life. There are a couple of fantastic cartoons by James Gillray, including a monstrously surreal picture of a man’s huge feet lying on top of much smaller female ones. The meaning of this 1790s satire on the private life of the Duke of York may be obscure now, but its mad energy and monstrous imagination is alive and kicking in the same way as the writings of Jonathan Swift. The British Museum has the best collection of British satirical art in the world – why choose so few examples?Keeping it funny would have been a good idea. The history of satire, which Private Eye is part of, is worth telling. Instead, this exhibition invents an aspect of human nature that does not exist. There is no universal impulse to dissent. There are different reasons to rebel, in different times and places. The complicated mapping of those reasons is called history and you can’t reduce it to a few speech bubbles.• I Object: Ian Hislop’s Search for Dissent is at the British Museum, London, from 6 September to 20 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c489d5a19bf28e9146bc2ae402904c4609b1b24/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4b4d3ff40bb2e04a3ffc0acc17e797a7 1320w","title":"the guardian view on jeremy corbyn dominating through democracy","story":"The Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn is now almost certainly the largest mainstream leftwing party in Europe. It has more than 550,000 members, six times the number of Conservatives. After the election last year in which Mr Corbyn’s Labour party defied expectations and reduced the Tories to a government without a parliamentary majority, he has been able to dominate the party machine. The left now enjoys unprecedented control of Labour – among the membership, the annual party conference and its ruling body, the national executive committee. There is one missing piece of the jigsaw – the parliamentary Labour party, most of which declared it had no confidence in Mr Corbyn in 2016.In Britain’s system MPs are paid to be representatives, not delegates. They obey their own judgment over the roiling opinions of their constituents. They might respect local activists’ opinions and take them into account when reaching decisions, but MPs – rightly – retain an independence of thought and action. The question, however, is whether they should, once in power, have a job until voters move against them. A democratic system of government ought not to forestall pressure for party reform. In that respect Labour’s “democracy review” is welcome as it looks at how the grassroots could have a greater say in party matters. Should members have a larger role in selecting candidates? Momentum, a leftwing grassroots organisation, thinks so. It has been taken by the success of “vibrant, radical and winning alternative” candidates in US Democrat primaries.Momentum claims that Labour’s “restrictive, outdated rulebook” makes it almost impossible to displace a sitting Labour MP. It is undoubtedly hard. But it happens. Of the five Labour rebels who broke the party whip to vote against an amendment to keep a post-Brexit Britain in a customs union with the EU, three – Frank Field, Kate Hoey, and Graham Stringer – are now facing deselection. Local members were furious that the Labour rebels had thrown away a chance to reject the government’s hard Brexit. Yet Momentum has a point: the present system is designed to shield sitting parliamentarians. To deselect a Labour MP, half of the local branches – both of the party as well as an almost unlimited number of affiliated bodies – in the constituency have to vote against a parliamentarian. If that happens, then an open selection can be run. In effect, only an MP estranged from both their local party and Labour powerbrokers can be deselected. In an age of mass participatory politics, this feels wrong.However, any changes ought not to make Labour MPs more subservient to a supreme leader. If a system developed where it is easier to challenge MPs in positive way, rather than one where smears and money dominate, then all well and good. The cause of democracy, however, won’t be helped if Labour MPs are subjected to local loyalty tests. They ought not be purged for not being pure enough. Tory MPs are more easily removed by local parties than Labour ones – though the leader can intervene, and has done so. Mr Corbyn should keep his parliamentary critics close and convince them that party democracy is a way to revive political fortunes. His critics know the left won’t win every seat. Remainers should be cheered that Labour members are overwhelmingly pro-European and support is starting to build behind a push for a “people’s vote” on any Brexit deal. Centrists should come up with their own proposals to democratise Labour. All parties are coalitions, and Labour’s factions – however split – need each another. They will either come together, or come apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92b5e50cc067db7de0ab7484b33d0e33fa5a7d39/0_0_2560_1708/master/2560.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3a12f82437913e5feaf83bce2ab6fc75 1440w","title":"jose mourinho the nice one radical rebrand manchester united","story":"There may have been more rivetingly awkward televised football interviews in the last few seasons than José Mourinho’s rivetingly awkward post-match exchange with the BBC’s Juliette Ferrington on Match of the Day 2 on Sunday. But not many of them. And none as rivetingly awkward in quite the same way – awkward to an end, pointedly awkward, awkward with a certain kind of gain in mind and above all, just really awkward.Ferrington put it to Mourinho that Romelu Lukaku had told her his manager was a totally different man on the training pitch. At which point it all went a bit fuzzy. Mourinho paused. He took a breath. Something weird seemed to be happening to his face. The eyes were the same, still ablaze with the familiar righteous fury, the eyes of a notoriously vengeful star federation president about to unleash the unimaginable fury of his planetary destructor beam on the cowering scum of this peace-loving rural idyll.But Mourinho’s mouth was doing something strange, curling just a little at the edges, in what appeared to be an unaccustomed “up” direction, almost like a smile. “People who know me, they like me,” he mumbled eventually, a bead of sweat breaking out on his forehead as through sheer force of will he summoned up what might have been a genial twinkle. This was something new. This was novel, and even a little disturbing. This was José being nice.It is, of course, necessary to issue general apologies at this point. Yes, it’s another José Mourinho article. Let’s face it, this is to be expected at the start of a Premier League season that has so far been a fairly room temperature affair elsewhere. Like United, Mourinho remains an object of fascination, in part because he has always intended this to be the case. And partly also because this latest gambit, new Nice José, José of the people uniting the fans, is so clearly a plan, something that has been discussed and settled on to change the weather around the club.This was evident from the moment at the end of the Tottenham game when Mourinho stayed to applaud the home crowd very publicly, smiling like a shark at a birthday party. Mourinho was there again applauding the fans at Burnley, as he generally does, but more pointedly this time, a surprisingly urgent figure suddenly, transformed into a footballing version of Victor Laszlo in Casablanca, an elegantly turned out man of the people, populist in a grey zip-neck sweater. The players are on board too. “United now more than ever” David de Gea tweeted on Thursday night. A few hours later Eric Bailly went with “Now More than Ever … Together”. Jesse Lingard offered the hashtag #UnitedTogether.This feels like a welcome move on many levels, both personal and tactical. United were expected to beat Burnley at Turf Moor. Sunday’s performance may mean nothing at all, a brief spike in a parabola of sullen decline that most assume will culminate in a toxic farewell within the year. But taken together with the first half against Tottenham last Monday there was something structurally different, an altered angle of approach.Persona, attitude, the styling of his managerial personality: this is important to Mourinho, a major part of his professional voodoo. Finding an approach, a set of tactics and a persona that fits with his players is key. Something about the way Mourinho has presented himself in the last week speaks to the way he has done this, successfully, in the past.The fact remains Mourinho has only ever really been his best self, only achieved extraordinary things when he has been the underdog, when his team have come from outside the elite to beat the elite. Most obviously at Porto, but also at Internazionale where a mixed team of might-bes and old lags won a first European Cup in 45 years. Even Chelsea were a club ready to be led in 2004, moneyed arrivistes driven on to a first League title since the days of Ted Drake.Mourinho got so good at managing top-level underdog clubs he was allowed to manage top-level overdog clubs. And it is here the congealment set in. Mourinho wants to disrupt, to destroy your expensively acquired plans and impose his own will. It requires constant drilling, players who are willing to suffer and an audience willing to take pleasure in a little darkness. This best Mourinho was a populist outsider. At Real Madrid and now at United he has been an un-populist insider, become the kind of man he had always hated, or sought to bring down.And so on to new Nice José, the populist underdog, the unity candidate. To his credit, and however awkwardly, Mourinho is making efforts to unite his base, to create a winning spirit, to re-forge those bonds. Best of all this coincided at Burnley, and for half a game against Tottenham, with a more José-looking team, a return to the pared-down, hard-running football of his best XIs.Lukaku played less with his back to goal, and instead ran with real verve and intelligence into space on either flank. At times he was devastating, an old school Mourinho-style leader from the front in the style of Diego Milito or Didier Drogba. Behind him Paul Pogba had the right kind of entourage, two defensive midfielders allowing him to pass more, make the play, show his range of angles. Last season Pogba was 19th on the list of accurate long passes from central midfield in the Premier League. Currently he is fourth this season. Against Burnley his link-ups with Lukaku were instant and incisive, direct football in the best Mourinho sense.Two years ago Antonio Conte reconfigured his Chelsea team to devastating effect over the autumn international break. It may be too much to expect something similar. But Mourinho is at least trying something else here, a little grudging charm where the snarls had begun to drag everyone down, and a slight, perhaps incidental modification of his team along simpler, more classically Mourinho lines in its past two matches.The charm offensive may, in the end, prove a bridge too far but at least there is some hope, whatever the outcome of his third season, that Mourinho will not leave United without ever having really wrestled this team into something resembling one of his own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513aa7637d3560180b873d6ff145de0ae4b2b7ad/0_522_4996_2996/master/4996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc58feee1fcd9b6aa82706c1c70c33b2","title":"how lose weight in shower notes queries","story":"The long-running series in which readers answer other readers’ questions on subjects ranging from trivial flights of fancy to profound scientific conceptsIf I weigh myself naked before taking a shower and again immediately afterwards, my weight has always dropped by at least half a pound (approximately 200g) and sometimes by over a pound.

The whole thing is worth watching, but the part that has gone viral is when she calls the Kardashians “double agents”: women who get other women to trust them, only to sell us ideals (and products) that damage us. “It’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” she says. “Just because you look like a woman, we trust you and think you’re on our side but … you’re selling us self-consciousness.”Still, blaming other women for misogyny has always felt uncomfortable – like you are doing patriarchy’s job by turning on women pressured to conform to sexism, rather than critiquing the male-dominated structures that got us here. But Jamil is surely speaking out about a side to sexism that is worth confronting. As she puts it: “I don’t care if you’re a woman. For us to evolve, we need some sort of constructive criticism.”This is a longstanding idea, from Madeleine Albright’s “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other” to Caitlin Moran coining the term “Vichy France with tits” for women who pander to sexism to make money.The “double agents” concept keeps being floated because these issues are not budging. Loose Women – a show fronted by women and aimed at women – was reported to Ofcom more than 7,000 times following an on-air row last week between Kim Woodburn and Coleen Nolan that saw Woodburn walk off in tears. Earlier in the summer, the show broadcast an “exclusive” on Maureen Nolan’s facelift, including her bloodied, bruised face post-surgery.The social media age is making this stuff feel all the more toxic. But pitting women against women is not limited to reality TV stars and daytime chatshows. News sites such as Conservative Woman – which last week published an article equating the right to use abortion pills at home with flushing a baby down the toilet – perpetuate a form of gender politics every bit as damaging as any Kardashian, but do so under their own sheep’s clothing: educated, middle-class white women making the case for gender roles as a reasonable assault on feminism “gone too far”.Whether it is lollipops or a keyboard, in a society where we are pressed to tear each other down, the greatest way for women to fight back is by lifting one another up.

Links have also been found between elevated blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and the risk of dementia, although these are not conclusive. Monitoring your weight and cardiovascular health in middle age could greatly reduce your likelihood of dementia.The brain may be affected by the long-term consequences of heavy smoking. Scientists have found smoking to increase the risk of cognitive decline in old age, with one study showing that middle-aged people who smoked more than two packs a day more than doubled their risk of later-life dementia.Numerous studies have shown that regular, vigorous physical activity - and in some cases, even mild exercise such as walking - can preserve your faculties in later life. Staying active is particularly important for the elderly, with studies finding that older iniduals who began a regular exercise programme experienced improved cognitive function. However, younger people should avoid sports where they are prone to repeated head traumas, such as boxing or even football. There is growing evidence that even moderate traumas increase the risk of developing certain forms of dementia.People with more years of school and university education are known to have a lower risk of dementia, but there is evidence that everyone can reduce their risk of dementia through trying new things as they get older. Taking up new hobbies, learning new skills and partaking in a daily intellectual activity such as doing crossword puzzles are all thought to have neuroprotective effects.Maintaining social activities as you get older, such as going to clubs or volunteering, has been found to have a protective effect against dementia. Studies have shown that iniduals who maintain a larger social network into old age tend to have better cognitive functions and a reduced risk of cognitive decline.Scientists are still not completely clear on how various nutrients, vitamins and food groups affect your risk of dementia. However, there have been a few studies focusing on the Mediterranean diet – which consists of small amounts of meat, and an emphasis on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts and olive oil – that suggest it can reduce risk of dementia, possibly by preventing high blood pressure.Sleep disturbances, for example chronic insomnia, have been linked to increased risk for cognitive decline in later life. Taking steps to deal with any sleep problems could reduce your chances of getting dementia. However scientists still don’t understand exactly how disturbed sleep may contribute to the condition, and whether certain dysfunctional sleep patterns pose more of a risk than others."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d4fcdc4d400ef5c6c8cec78b5f77d5d0961b8f/171_31_1749_1049/master/1749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=423485effabc19066bfa8e6299882d66","title":"bomb disposal sent to bbc after reports of suspicious vehicle","story":"Nearby roads were closed as controlled explosions took place on orange vanPolice carried out a series of controlled explosions outside BBC Broadcasting House on Monday after reports of a suspicious vehicle.A bomb disposal robot and emergency services were photographed investigating an orange van, which emergency services later established contained cardboard boxes and a motorbike.

The tiny digital-only station – which shares a name but little else with the old Virgin Radio – was relaunched two years ago and is now owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK, who will will hope that some of Evans’ 9m-strong morning audience come with him to a station that currently struggles to attract more than a few hundred thousand listeners.It’s a characteristically bold jump for Evans, who began his career as a jobbing radio producer in his native north-west England, working for a brief period as a driver for Frank Sidebottom, the (literally) big-headed comedy creation of Chris Sievey, and then moved to London where he got his break as a radio presenter on BBC station GLR before hitting the mainstream as a presenter on Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast in 1992, while still in his mid-20s.He used his knowledge of youth television to found Ginger Productions, his own company, producing the lucrative Don’t Forget Your Toothbrush format and taking on the contract to revive Radio 1’s breakfast show in 1995, when the station was being reinvented by former controller Matthew Bannister. Aided by a slick PR operation provided by Matthew Freud, the show rapidly became a success. But Evans’ increasingly erratic behaviour – missing shows because he had been drinking all day and demanding that he should be allowed to work four days a week to concentrate on his TV show TFI Friday – was seen as typifying the worst of Britpop-era excess and led to him quitting in 1997.After a short break, Evans returned as the breakfast show host on Richard Branson’s Virgin Radio, which he bought soon afterwards before flipping it in a £225m mega-deal that made him a fortune. Despite continuing to hit the headlines – he was the first person to give away a million-pound prize on British radio – he fell out with the new owners. After they refused to allow him to stay on air to broadcast during an England football match, he went on a three-day bender, failing to turn up at work while journalists chased him around central London pubs with his then girlfriend Billie Piper. Virgin Radio bosses sacked him and Evans lost the messy court case which followed, with the judge calling Evans “manipulative” and accusing him of resorting “to any means, fair or foul, to achieve his ends”.He returned to the airwaves in 2005 with his reputation at a low ebb, hosting a weekend Radio 2 slot which ultimately led to him taking the station’s drivetime show. He completed his redemptive arc by replacing Sir Terry Wogan in the flagship breakfast slot from 2010.Despite maintaining a strong audience for the UK’s biggest radio show, he endured a disastrous stint as Jeremy Clarkson’s replacement on BBC Two’s motoring magazine Top Gear which took its toll on the presenter’s reputation.He was also stung by the government’s decision to force the BBC to reveal its stars’ salaries, which revealed that he earned between £2,200,000 and £2,249,999 from the corporation in 2017. In common with other BBC presenters, he agreed to take a pay cut – in addition to losing his Top Gear presenting fee – but is thought to have been uncomfortable with the publicity surrounding his status as the BBC’s biggest-earning star. The publication of salaries has helped commercial rivals pick off BBC talent, and the new iteration of Virgin Radio, now ultimately under the control of former Sun editor and current News UK boss Rebekah Brooks, will have paid a substantial sum to secure his services for the Murdoch-owned business. Evans has previously written a column about the Australian-born media magnate’s 2011 closure of the News of the World, saying he was a phone-hacking victim, but that despite the promise of a substantial payout, he would not be suing, as it was “tantamount to dealing with the devil”. Now he will be working for him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1670de2a93fc883e25d444385b52812a39886722/34_0_1457_874/master/1457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed3b518edf6bb1b5f82fbbf14fcd6c6e","title":"netflix amazon british made shows uk tv production","story":"Streaming services help drive UK TV production sector to record £2.7bn in revenuesNetflix and Amazon spent £150m on British-made TV shows last year including Black Mirror and The Crown, driving the UK production sector to a record high.Overall, the UK TV production sector hit a new high of £2.7bn in annual revenues, helped by the sale of programmes such as Victoria, Sherlock and Midsomer Murders overseas, which hit a record £218m.In just a few short years, Netflix and Amazon, which has produced UK hits including The Grand Tour, have grown to account for almost one-third of the £549m total spent on UK commissions by overseas broadcasters.“It is inevitable those big platforms want to work with British producers, because we have a reputation for delivering creativity and quality,” said John McVay, the chief executive of TV producers’ association Pact. “We want to encourage all those platforms to spend more, and they almost certainly will, as they still account for a small proportion of total commissioning spend.”In April, Netflix, which has seen UK staff numbers swell from a little over a dozen to 60 in the space of a year, revealed that it will spend $1bn (£777m) on shows commissioned from producers across Europe this year. Netflix, which also made films including Brad Pitt’s War Machine in the UK last year, has a total budget of about $8bn (£6.2bn). Amazon is estimated to be spending about $5bn (£3.9bn) on film and TV content this year.The report also highlighted what might be termed the Love Island effect: the amount of money spent making programmes such as the ITV2 hit reality show, Channel 4’s Gogglebox and First Dates, has almost doubled to almost £260m since 2012, as the popularity of what is termed factual entertainment has boomed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/510e5f043a474744afe5edb73389fd967ccba823/0_0_3500_2305/master/3500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b8ad70e08f9456deaa84d8751a58342d 1400w","title":"aping each other how similar are humans and orangutans","story":"From umbrella-making to learning how to self-medicate, we share plenty of skills with our fellow great apesWhen scientists talk about animals using tools, they’re not normally talking about the implements you might use to knock up some shelves. But while animals generally confine themselves to bashing things with the odd rock, in extraordinary footage broadcast last year as part of the BBC’s Spy in the Wild series, a wild female orangutan is seen using a saw she has found outside a hut to cut through a log – even pausing to blow away sawdust before continuing.In the wild, orangutans use large sticks to get at honey inside logs, shelter from the rain by fashioning umbrellas out of leaves and hold bunches of leaves in front of their mouths to lower the pitch of their calls to scare off predators. Captive orangutans have been taught to use hammers, screwdrivers and keys.Researchers have even shown that orangutans learn and generate new sounds – an ability until recently considered largely the preserve of humans. The ability to consciously vibrate twin bands of muscle tissue in the larynx called vocal folds – important in generating many new sounds – was thought to have evolved after we erged from chimpanzees, our closest great ape relatives, some 5-7m years ago.Then, an international team of researchers caught wind of reports of a male orangutan called Rocky using sounds reminiscent of the plaintive groans made by Chewbacca, of Star Wars fame, to attract the attention of his keepers at Indianapolis Zoo. In a study published in 2016, the group compared Rocky’s call to other known orangutan sounds and found it to be novel.They then taught him to imitate a human who was making versions of his call at different pitches. “This shows the ability to change the frequency of calls through control of the vocal folds was likely to have predated the last common ancestor of humans and orangutans,” says Prof Serge Wich, of Liverpool John Moores University, one of the study’s authors.Orangutans have also been shown to have human-like, long-term memories. In 2009, Danish scientists showed a group of orangutans and chimps how to retrieve a piece of banana by reaching through a slot with the longer of two sticks, and then hid the sticks in boxes in nearby rooms. Three years later, all bar one of the orangutans knew what to do to get the food in the same set-up.Just as the list of tool-using animals has grown in recent years, so too has the list of those that use plants as medicine. Lizards eat certain roots to counter snake venom, macaws consume clay to aid digestion as well as to gain minerals, and pregnant lemurs nibble tamarind and fig leaves to boost milk production. Orangutans are among a smaller group of primates that self-medicate by rubbing substances into their fur.Behavioural ecologist Helen Morrogh-Bernard, of Exeter University, and co-director of the Borneo Nature Foundation, last year reported observing child-bearing female orangutans chewing the leaves of the shrub Dracaena cantleyi to form a soapy foam that they then rub into their upper arms or legs. Chemical analysis showed it has anti-inflammatory properties. Local people use the same plant as pain relief. Unlike many other similarities between orangutans and humans, this one has cultural rather than evolutionary roots. And not in the way you might think. “When we surveyed local people,” says Morrogh-Bernard, “they told us their ancestors started using a number of plants as medicines after seeing orangutans doing so.”So our two species are very similar – to the extent that we sometimes even have things to learn from them.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

But palm oil cultivation in south-east Asia is clearing forests and contributing to the decline of orangutans. Here are the key points Think back over the past week in your life. If you’ve applied lipstick, eaten toast or put on a load of washing, chances are, you’ve used a product containing palm oil. Indulged in ice-cream or washed your hair? Palm oil. According to the World Wildlife Fund: “It is in about half of all packaged products sold in the supermarket.” And it’s linked to the destruction of the rainforest and many of the species that reside in it.To stop palm oil being listed as “vegetable oil” or as one of a long list of hard to pronounce synonyms, an EU law was passed in 2014, stating that all food products containing palm oil should be labelled clearly. But the same cannot be said for cosmetics and household products in which palm oil is often used.Indonesia is home to some of the most bioerse areas in the world, including the Leuser ecosystem, the last place on Earth where Sumatran orangutans, elephants, tigers, rhinos and sun bears coexist naturally. The Tropical Heritage Rainforest of Sumatra – of which the Leuser ecosystem is a part – is a Unesco world heritage site, but it’s still in danger from palm oil plantations, pulp production and infrastructure projects. Orangutans are keystone species, which, according to National Geographic, means they help define entire ecosystems. If a keystone species – sea otters, elephants, honey bees, for example – disappears, no other species can fill its shoes, and the ecosystem changes irrevocably. Mainstream media now regularly covers palm oil, campaigns such as Say No to Palm Oil have sprung up and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil runs a certification system, which aims to ensure all palm oil with its stamp comes from sustainably managed plantations. Genuine change is yet to occur, however, prompting campaigners to put pressure on brands that use palm oil, urging them to use their power to genuinely reform their suppliers.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

Some American conservatives do. Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon, may agree with them. Or he may not.That was the takeaway from a week of social media-stoked controversy over the movie, which opened the Venice film festival to positive reviews.First Man reunites the men behind the Oscar-winning La La Land: the director Damien Chazelle, who was born in the US to a French father and a Canadian mother, and Gosling, who is fully Canadian.The movie does not show the moment on 21 July 1969 when the two American astronauts who travelled on Apollo 11 planted a US flag on the lunar surface. Critics reported that the stars and stripes is nonetheless visible in the moon-set scenes.He also said he did not think Armstrong “viewed himself as an American hero” and added: “From my interviews with his family and people that knew him, it was quite the opposite. And we wanted the film to reflect Neil.”In an echo of controversies over American films that appropriate historic achievements by other nations – think U-571 – US conservatives were duly outraged. On TV, the Fox \u0026amp Friends host Ainsley Earhardt linked the film to protests by NFL players and recent remarks by New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo.“They don’t think America is great,” she said. “They want to kneel for the flag, for the anthem … ‘It was never great’ … They’re scared to use the American flag. It’s Hollywood.”Unusually for an avid viewer and frequent regurgitator of Fox \u0026amp Friends, Donald Trump did not tweet on the matter. But Marco Rubio did.“To address the question of whether this was a political statement, the answer is no. My goal with this movie was to share with audiences the unseen, unknown aspects of America’s mission to the moon – particularly Neil Armstrong’s personal saga and what he may have been thinking and feeling during those famous few hours.”Members of Armstrong’s family moved to calm things down. In a statement also credited to the biographer James R Hansen, Rick and Mark Armstrong said: “This story is human and it is universal. Of course, it celebrates an America achievement. It also celebrates an achievement ‘for all mankind’, as it says on the plaque Neil and Buzz left on the moon.”Mark Armstrong also praised the British actor Claire Foy for her performance as his mother, Janet Armstrong.She “only passed away recently”, he told the Mail on Sunday, “so to see her up there, alive and so real … it was incredible.” Foy, he said, captured his mother’s “essence. She communicates so many feelings without words. I got very emotional.”But no social media fire can be left untended, lest it burn itself out. On Sunday night, Aldrin, 88 – who is played in the movie by an American, Corey Stoll – posted a string of hashtags on Twitter: “#proudtobeanAmerican, #freedom, #honor, #onenation, #Apollo11, #July1969, #roadtoApollo50”.Inevitably, in certain circles his tweet was seized as evidence of disapproval."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c19c239849910ff496e4c80d12efa86741128cb3/0_79_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b5fa0a2cfac9935b38b16276796bae7","title":"you me and the big c host rachael bland only has days to live","story":"BBC presenter, 40, diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016, tweets ‘the time has come’BBC presenter Rachael Bland, who has discussed her experience of terminal cancer in a leading podcast, has announced she has only got days to live.Bland, who also presents the news on BBC North West Tonight, said the “time has come” and that the experience was “very surreal”.“Au revoir my friends,” she tweeted.The 40-year-old journalist was diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2016 and began blogging about her experience of chemotherapy. Earlier this year she convinced BBC bosses to let her turn this into a podcast, You, Me and the Big C, which she co-presents with Deborah James and Lauren Mahon, two other women whose cancers have gone into remission. The aim was to produce a show which took a “a candid look at cancer” and it was immediately popular. But while the programme became a success, there was worse news for Bland. In May, following several rounds of treatment, she was told that her cancer had turned terminal and two months later she was informed it had spread further.Bland, who has a two-year-old child with her husband Steve, last month used an article in the Sunday  to describe how she was locked in a “race against time” to write a memoir for her son. At that point she believed she had “less than a year” to live.“I’m not scared of dying,” she wrote. “I only fear for those I leave behind. For my darling Freddie, who’ll be three next month, for Steve and our families. Even now, knowing the ‘no options left’ conversation is coming, I can’t crumble and fall to pieces.“I have to suppress a lot of the darkest thoughts about Freddie growing up without his mummy around. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be able to enjoy the precious times we have left together.“I still want to take joy from the moments when he turns to me, as he has begun to the last few weeks, and says: ‘Oh, I missed you Mummy. I love you so much’.”Colleagues, including former 5Live presenter Richard Bacon, expressed their sadness at the news but said “You, Me, and the Big C” had helped change the conversation around cancer.

He just got on with the job and was a wonderfully reassuring presence but his capacity to remain intensely focused yet relaxed at the crease has become elusive over the past year.Perhaps the worst feeling for a batsman is to be playing well and not scoring. The mind starts to wander and then asks: “What happens now if I start playing badly?” This is the kind of territory Cook has been inhabiting recently.From late August 2017 Cook has played 27 Test innings and passed 50 only twice, once spectacularly at Melbourne when he finished on 244 not out and there was a 70 at Leeds against Pakistan in May. Yet for most of that time he seemed to be playing quite well. Then he would get out. This was at odds with the bulk of his England career.Initially his failures might have been seen as a nasty coincidence. Perhaps he was attracting a sequence of superb deliveries his dismissals against Ravi Ashwin at Edgbaston a month ago may have encouraged such a thesis. But in the rest of the series against India after laying foundations at the start of every innings there has been one nick too many. The “nasty coincidence” theory could not be sustained. In his farewell statement Cook appropriately used the analogy his mentor, Graham Gooch, coined. “There is nothing left in the tank”.He will depart as England’s most capped Test cricketer - the match at the Oval will be his 161st - who has scored around 2,500 more Test runs than any other Englishman (he would have to muster 146 in his final Test for that to be precisely the case and Sod’s Law may dictate everything suddenly clicks again). It is just possible Jimmy Anderson, 18 Tests behind, could overtake his number of appearances. In his 12 years as a Test player he has never been dropped and has missed only one game, through sickness in Mumbai in 2006.His departure will be predictably dignified he has shunned the glitz of the celebrity cricketer he has never been a hindrance to match referees, umpires or his captains before or after his tenure in charge of England, which lasted longer than anyone else in terms of matches (59). Do not mistake his decorous behaviour for softness. Cook may have retained the smile of a choirboy over the years but he outlasted previous batsmen and captains because he was so tough and, on occasions, obstinate and capable of tunnel vision.NB Cook scored 627 Test runs batting at No3 or No7294\u0026nbspHighest Test score, against India in 2011.766 Runs scored in the 2010-11 Ashes, when England won in Australia for the first time in 24 years.173\u0026nbspCatches taken in Test cricket, the most by an England outfielder.59\u0026nbspTests as captain, another England record.562\u0026nbspRuns scored in four Tests against India in 2012-13, his first series as full-time captain. England won a series in India for the first time in 28 years.15 Opening partners in his career:\u0026nbspAndrew Strauss, Michael Vaughan, Michael Carberry, Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Nick Compton, Joe Root, Sam Robson, Adam Lyth, Moeen Ali, Alex Hales, Ben Duckett, Haseeb Hameed, Keaton Jennings, Mark Stoneman.1\u0026nbspTest wicket: Ishant Sharma at Trent Bridge in 2014.46.57\u0026nbspCook’s average as captain. When he was in the ranks he averaged 43.84.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp46.97 Cook’s career strike rate per 100 balls – faster than, among others, Graham Thorpe, Robin Smith, Jacques Kallis, Faf du Plessis and Nasser Hussain.18.62 Cook’s average in 2018, easily his lowest in a calendar year.That soon became evident from his batting at the start of his Test career when he willed himself to a debut century in Nagpur in 2006 having spent three days travelling from the Caribbean as an emergency replacement. He scored 164 runs in that match and he was dismissed only once when the word was that he was supposed to be frail against spin. Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh failed to spot any obvious weaknesses.He has hit 32 Test centuries. In nearly all of them he batted in the same way, so quite a few fade from memory. That is how so many great players proceed. They establish a method that works and stick to it, more or less regardless of the situation. So aside from his debut his most memorable knocks stem from the context of the game: the double century in Brisbane in November 2010 the three hundreds in consecutive games in India in 2012, the first in defeat in Ahmedabad to show his teammates what was possible, the second alongside Kevin Pietersen in Mumbai to set up a famous victory, the third to consolidate England’s revival in Kolkata.That trip to India was Cook’s first as England’s official captain – he had deputised for Andrew Strauss in Bangladesh in 2010. With the captaincy came an unwelcome opportunity to display his toughness again. He inherited the Pietersen situation after the resignation of Strauss. Once your correspondent was about to praise him for the pragmatic foresight of restoring Pietersen to the side for that tour to India in 2012 when he said he would not have picked him if it had been solely his decision, which might be an example of a principled stand to some, tunnel vision to others.In 2014 the Pietersen issue rumbled on as England faltered against Sri Lanka and India under Cook’s captaincy. He was subjected to unprecedented vitriol on social media. As ever he bore this in a dignified manner and he toughed it out. It may have helped that he has always had the wisdom not to participate in social media so he must have avoided some of the barbs. At Southampton that summer he hit 95, an important return to form in such a stormy season, and he received a standing ovation fit for a triple centurion. There has always been a silent majority out there who admire his qualities and on that day they let him know it. They will be doing the same at the Oval this week.At the end of his statement Cook says, “I can’t wait to get fully involved with Essex in their 2019 season”, which prompted two thoughts: Cook has a simple love of the game and his county rather like Marcus Trescothick. Then came the hypothetical: next summer it is 2-2 in the Ashes Cook averages 80 for Essex there is a batting crisis at the top of England’s order. Would he answer the call? At a guess, no. Once Cook’s mind is made up it takes something seismic to change it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0494656525da645dd82ceea42d28ae438416ccd/0_82_3520_2112/master/3520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3706592a9465f0710daac8730509500","title":"alessandro tonelli tour of britain julian alaphilippe cycling","story":"The sort-out in the final kilometres through the Devon surf strip was as decisive as the stage’s sawtooth profile had suggested. The overall standings when the race reaches London on Sunday are now likely to be decided between the nine riders who crossed the line in Barnstaple just behind the winner, Cameron Meyer of Australia, who had escaped on the opening climb over 100 miles earlier and hung on by a whisker.In the final 200m Meyer had no difficulty in disposing of another early escapee, Alessandro Tonelli of Italy, who took the race leader’s green jersey after countback to the opening stage. The victory was a rare road win for the 30-year-old track-racing specialist, who has taken nine senior world titles in endurance races and is renowned as a rider who can lap the field time after time in points races rather than as a man who can hold out for mile after mile of hilly terrain.In recent years Meyer has mixed road and track, winning a stage in the Tour of Switzerland and helping the GreenEdge squad to the team time-trial stage of the 2013 Tour de France his track racing background had, he said, given him confidence that he could win a sprint finish with any of his breakaway companions. “I got the Italian to lead up to 500 metres to go and it wasn’t a problem,” he said.The issue was whether they would stay in front they were lucky to elude a strong chasing group of eight – plus another early escapee, the young Welshman Scott Davies – who had come together as the roads climbed and fell away repeatedly through Ilfracombe, Woolacombe and Croyde before the run-in through Braunton.The octet included the Quickstep duo who had attacked in the finale on Sunday at Newport, Julian Alaphilippe and Bob Jungels, the Team Sky leader Wout Poels and the man who finished fourth in the Tour de France, Primož Roglič.Also in there was the reed-thin Preston climber Hugh Carthy, who had sparked the final sort-out with a searing attack as the road reared up out of Ilfracombe with 32km remaining.Alaphilippe overhauled Carthy 10km later on the climb around Challacombe, 1.3km of steep, narrow Devon lane used for the national hill-climb championship in 1985, where a six-rider chase group including Jungels, Poels and Roglič formed behind, as the Newport stage winner, André Greipel, was reduced almost to walking pace along with the other heavyweights in the peloton.The six caught Alaphilippe and Carthy and then swept up Davies, who had the compensation of taking the King of the Mountains jersey for his efforts. Up ahead, Meyer and Tonelli were initially unsure what the time gap was but kept working well together until the very end.“When we heard, we knew it would be touch and go,” Meyer said. “With those names in that group, it was going to come up very quick in the last few kilometres.”Meyer had been a surprise presence when five riders escaped soon after the start east of Exeter, and his workrate at the head of affairs forced Team Sky on to the defensive.Chris Froome was prominent as Sky endeavoured to keep the quintet within reach through the rolling hills of mid-Devon, where lonely hamlets were competing to welcome the race. There were ranks of scarecrow dummies – around 30 in Meshaw – while farmers in neighbouring Alswear had created a vast artistic work featuring formations of tractors and hay bales.The out-and-home stage in Bristol on Tuesday finishes on the Downs by Clifton with two short steep climbs in the final 10km. It should, said Carthy, be similar to the Devon finale but more technical and it will suit one man in particular: Alaphilippe, ominously strong here as he builds to the world road championships later in the month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d9f8b02d1364364723e999da2136e592355088e/0_41_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da75d2f8caaba82086db1313eba2fad1","title":"andy murray miss davis cup return to full fitness kyle edmund","story":"• Leon Smith: ‘I know he was really wanting to play some part’• Kyle Edmund will also miss Uzbekistan tie in GlasgowAndy Murray has decided to continue work on his slow and difficult return to full fitness rather than play for Great Britain in the Davis Cup tie against Uzbekistan, which starts in Glasgow a week on Friday.It cannot have been easy for Murray, who has embraced agony of mind and body all his career, to pass up what will almost certainly be his last chance to play in front of his Scottish fans, in the city where he was born. His prospects of playing Davis Cup again, in the shorter format to be introduced next year, are also uncertain. Murray was desperate to play, according to his team, but the medical advice was to continue rehab and, “think sensibly for the longer term”.For this World Group play-off, the last under the old system, Smith has brought back Dan Evans, who has played some excellent tennis since returning from his one-year drugs ban. But Kyle Edmund, who has struggled with a non-specified illness most of the year, will not play – even though he is scheduled to take part in the Laver Cup in Chicago the week after the tie.Smith said of Edmund’s controversial decision to choose an exhibition tournament over playing for Great Britain: “I guess the issue is that it’s a little bit further down the line. At least he can get a few weeks now of uninterrupted strength and conditioning work, fitness work, which obviously you can’t do if you’re trying to prepare for a Davis Cup match.”Edmund, who went out in the first round at the US Open, was unusually coy about discussing the nature of the illness that has struck him down just as he has risen through the rankings.The player said: “After Wimbledon I fell ill and this forced me to withdraw from Umag. Since then I haven’t been able to regain my original physical condition and my team have advised me to take this week off to focus on getting my strength and fitness back in order for me to play competitive tennis again.”As for the rehabilitation of Evans, he said: “History is in the past. He’s playing well. It’s astonishing how quickly he’s moved up the rankings. He’s already guaranteed Aussie quallies and hopefully he can keep making inroads over the next few months. Next year he’ll be looking to get back inside the top 100 and beyond again.”He added: “We have to respect what Kyle and Andy have decided to do, and it is the right call for both of them. We go with what I think is a strong team. I think we can have a lot of fun, a lot of excitement, a lot of good tennis.”Smith will choose from Cameron Norrie, Jay Clarke and Evans in the singles, with Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot playing doubles.He said Andy Murray did consider playing doubles but the logistics of preparing for the tournament did not fit with his programme in Miami. As for whether the former world No 1 would fit Davis Cup into his 2019 schedule, Smith said: “It’s too early for that. The number one focus for him will be – as he keeps saying – by the time he gets to Australia next year to be in a really, really good place and have a great 2019, injury free.“I’d imagine it would still include smarter scheduling, and what to play. But I hope he features again. I know he’s loved it, and I know it’s always one that he’s mentioned through his press conferences when asked about the new format, that he’d give it a go and see if it works.”"},{"url":null,"title":"colin kaepernick nike just do it campaign nfl","story":"Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who sparked controversy by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice, will be the face of a Nike ad campaign for the 30th anniversary of its “Just Do It” motto.Kaepernick was a quarterback in the NFL for six years. He stirred national debate by taking a knee while the anthem was played before games during the 2016 season, to draw attention to police killings of African Americans and other issues. Kaepernick on Monday tweeted a black-and-white photo of himself featuring the Nike logo and “just do it” slogan as well as a quote: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.”Nike has endorsed Kaepernick since 2011 but has not featured him in campaigns since his departure from the NFL.“We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation, who has leveraged the power of sport to help move the world forward,” Nike executive Gino Fisanotti told ESPN. “We wanted to energize its meaning and introduce ‘Just Do It’ to a new generation of athletes.”The protests during the national anthem, soon embraced by other players, raised the ire of some NFL fans, Republican politicians and President Donald Trump. Trump said the players disrespected the American flag and the military, and has said he would love to see NFL owners fire players who disrespected the flag. Kaepernick and another former 49ers player, Eric Reid, have not been signed by any of the NFL’s 32 teams since their protests spread. Both have filed collusion grievances against NFL owners. On Thursday, arbitrator Stephen Burbank denied the league’s request to dismiss the case, which means he found sufficient evidence for the case to continue and perhaps go to trial. News of Nike’s ad campaign broke just days before the first game of the NFL season on Thursday, when the controversy over pre-game protests could flare anew. Kaepernick received an enthusiastic welcome from fans at the US Open’s showcase match between Serena and Venus Williams in New York on Friday night, when he was shown raising his fist on the big screen.Kaepernick has also found backing from an unlikely source: the former president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. “The #NFL season will start this week, unfortunately once again @Kaepernick7 is not on a NFL roster. Even though he is one of the best Quarterbacks in the league,” wrote Ahmadinejad on Twitter on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4abc1b38a54a7b46cb1665bb359c3584e47f9c3c/0_25_5052_3031/master/5052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cdd7138fb256d8b5bddaec9bcd56996","title":"matt oconnor sacked","story":"• Australian shows the door after 40-6 thrashing at Exeter• Geordan Murphy to help fill coaching gapThe season is barely one game old but Leicester have already seen enough to persuade them to part company with their head coach, Matt O’Connor. The Australian has left Welford Road with immediate effect in the wake of the Tigers’ 40-6 opening weekend mauling at Exeter.Even by the increasingly brutal standards of professional sport the sacking qualifies among the more spectacular knee-jerk reactions of modern times, with the former Irish international Geordan Murphy now in temporary charge. O’Connor, however, had already started this season under pressure following his team’s failure to finish in the Premiership’s top four for the first time since 2004.The Tigers are unaccustomed to such mediocrity and the grim second-half showing at Sandy Park has clearly exhausted the board’s patience. “Matt was appointed head coach in April 2017 on the basis of his previous Premiership experience and his knowledge of the club,” said Leicester’s chairman, Peter Tom.”We believe the time is right to make this change in the best interests of the Tigers moving forward. We would like to thank Matt for his hard work and commitment.”O’Connor began his second spell at the club in the closing stages of the 2016-17 season and helped Tigers into the Premiership semi-finals that year. During his first stint the former Wallaby international enjoyed a productive partnership with the former director of rugby Richard Cockerill but these days Leicester are increasingly choking on the fumes of the country’s current pacesetters Saracens and Exeter.Murphy, an eight-time Premiership title winner and double European champion in his 16 years as a player at Tigers, will take over on an interim basis alongside fellow coaches Mark Bakewell, Boris Stankovich and Brett Deacon but Mike Ford, father of the Tigers’ England fly-half, George, is already among the names being linked with the vacancy.It would have been a good deal easier to change tack in the summer, rather than within 72 hours of the league season kicking off, and the Tigers board are beginning to look increasingly indecisive. The club sacked Cockerill in January 2017, opted to part company with his initial replacement, Aaron Mauger, three months later and, 16 months on, have now ditched O’Connor as well.The home supporters will also be quick to appreciate the irony when they welcome their next opponents Newcastle, guided by the former Tigers’ legend Dean Richards, to Welford Road this Saturday. If Leicester were to lose and also struggle away to new midlands rivals Wasps in Coventry, in round three it really would represent the start from hell.No pressure, then, on the much-liked Murphy who has been lobbed the warmest of hot potatoes.“As a club Leicester Tigers will always aspire to challenge for major honours in the incredibly competitive arena of professional elite club rugby and everyone at the club will fully support Geordan and the management group in driving the team forward,” said Tom. “Geordan knows the expectations and ambitions of the Tigers as well as anyone after more than 20 years here as player and coach, and we wish him and the team the very best for the challenges ahead.”Murphy’s first job will be to fill the hole left by the departure of the centre Matt Toomua and Tatafu Polota-Nau back to Australia where they are set to be involved for the Wallabies against South Africa in Brisbane. What the coaching outlook will be looking like at Leicester by the time the pair return to the UK is currently anyone’s guess."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42980ea872d71ab752e5db403469bf0b5108ba33/39_227_4792_2875/master/4792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8db159db23d79ca088409338bbfeef1b","title":"sebastian vettel ferrari italian grand prix lewis hamilton max verstappen","story":"Ferrari had looked strong going into the Italian Grand Prix but did not make the most of it while Max Verstappen shows the trait of champions in believing he can do no wrongFerrari and Sebastian Vettel must have concerns about how they did not manage to return the win that had looked so likely as the Italian Grand Prix weekend progressed.Their cars had looked strong through practice and qualifying and, having locked out the front row, they held all the cards. Vettel will doubtless have a long talk with his team about why he was not given the best shot at pole, which might have kept him out of Lewis Hamilton’s reach at the start, given he is in the title fight. However, he must also look to his own part in hitting Hamilton and his resultant fourth place. It is his fourth race error this year, a count of which Ferrari will be more than aware, especially given they are in the best position in a decade to win the championship. Kimi Räikkönen was simply outmanoeuvred by a formidable Mercedes strategy and Hamilton’s skill but the real pressure is on Vettel, who must now deliver without any misjudgments in the remaining seven races.Much was made of the booing in Monza but it is nothing new. This crowd has always been passionate, indeed it is what imbues the venue with such atmosphere. They have been showing a healthy disregard for anyone not driving a red car for years – Vettel was booed after his wins for Red Bull – and it is in equal proportion to the devotion they show to anyone representing Ferrari. Should Hamilton ever drive for them, and return the wins they desire, it is to be expected they would take to him in the same way they have to many non-Italian drivers including Michael Schumacher, Niki Lauda, Jean Alesi and of course Nigel “Il Leone” Mansell. Hamilton admitted it did nothing but spur him on and both he and Valtteri Bottas accepted that it was a part of sport. Some may find it distasteful but it is a reflection of the fervour of these fans and in truth often at Monza little more than pantomime in nature.Hamilton rated the race as “up there” with his greatest drives. Should he go on to take the title he may feel this is was a decisive moment and this win may go even higher in his estimation. He certainly served notice in Monza that he will take some beating. His drive suggests he is exhibiting perhaps the best form of his career.It was a complete performance on many levels, his racecraft was exceptional, especially in the two passes on Vettel and Räikkönen. Opportunistic and inch perfect on the German, he saw a chance and took it and did leave Vettel enough room. On Räikkönen his judgment on late-braking round the outside into the chicane was nerveless. Conceding his place to Räikkönen when the Finn fought back at Roggia was an object lesson in playing the long game. Added to all of which was the calm tyre management that ultimately helped ensure an unlikely win. He was at the heart of a brilliant race.After coming out of his early season travails and seemingly vindicated in sticking to his guns by refusing to change his driving style, Max Verstappen was once again convinced he was in the right in Monza – except he was wasn’t. He was adamant he had given Bottas enough room as the pair vied going into the first chicane – except he hadn’t. He clearly moved to the left in the braking zone and, because he had not left a full car’s width, hit Bottas, forced him on to the grass and into missing the corner. When his team told him he had a five-second penalty his response was classic Verstappen. “Don’t worry about it? It’s fucked,” he said. “I gave him space. They’re doing a great job of killing racing, honestly.” He was bullish afterwards in denying he had been at fault and was defended by legions of his fans.His talent is undoubted and on this evidence he also shares the trait shown by some of the greatest champions in believing they can do no wrong – regardless of the evidence.Marcus Ericsson’s 220mph crash after his DRS failed to close as he applied the brakes heading into the first chicane was another salutary reminder of the dangers inherent in motor racing. It was all the more terrible because there was no warning nor any suggestion of driver error, he simply hit the brakes and veered left into the wall before cartwheeling three times. He walked away unharmed, and although this was not an incident in which the cockpit protection device, halo, played a part, the race director Charlie Whiting did have data on its role in Charles Leclerc’s crash in Spa. Whiting said the impact was equivalent to 5,000kg – half of the load the device is designed to withstand. “There was no distortion of the halo there was no buckling,” Whiting said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7159a3a9c31728b1042e5956a9b52140eea4cb04/5_359_4562_2737/master/4562.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8038102e23914bae5c23e418d4f779d","title":"its good to talk how loose women chatted itself into a clickbait corner","story":"After nearly two decades on screen this once innovative show has descended into one big slanging match as the recent Kim Woodburn controversy demonstrates Over the past few years, Loose Women has become notorious for spirited debates on topics ranging from the banal (“Should Camilla be Queen?”) to the grossly insensitive (“Can rape ever be the woman’s fault?”). But when the show first aired in 1999, it was genuinely innovative. Back at the height of ladette culture, you might yell “Girl Power!” before sinking a pint or four but feminism was a dirty word, associated with stuffy weirdos who took life too seriously. Sexual harassment? You’ve got to laugh …Into this minefield of gender politics skipped Loose Women, with its ironic title and cheerful determination to speak informally about modern womanhood. The first all-female panel show in the UK and one of the first in the world (it was preceded by The View, created by US journalist Barbara Walters a couple of years earlier), its very existence was revolutionary – daring to suggest that women might have life experiences that were worthy of discussion, unmediated by men (as the majority of daytime TV still is).For women stuck at home due to illness, retirement or caring responsibilities, it offered something that was hard to come by in the days before blogs and Facebook groups: community. And not just figuratively – you could call in with your opinion and actually have a discussion, rather than clicking “Dunno” on a Twitter poll. Sure, the eye-searing yellow, pink and turquoise colour scheme made the set look as if it had been pilfered from Play School, and early discussions about whether it’s scandalous to sunbathe topless or selfish to not want a baby suggested this wasn’t a hard-hitting enterprise. But it still had gravitas: former reporter Kaye Adams was usually head panellist, and had the brains, empathy and quick thinking needed to guide a live daily show without appealing to the lowest common denominator.The other original panellists – Nadia Sawalha, Karren Brady and Jane Moore – seemed to have been picked for their ability to respectfully express opinions, but as time went on, people were hired on the basis of name recognition rather than the quality of their conversation. Debates descended into slanging matches and, perhaps inevitably, a line was crossed when Janet Street-Porter compared Penny Lancaster to “someone in Hitler’s Germany”.The show became more isive after Adams left in 2006, even as Ruth Langsford and Andrea McLean gamely tried to fill her peacemaker role. She’s back occasionally, but the old magic isn’t. The show’s producers recently sensed that participating in clickbait culture would bring them publicity, and so it has become a showcase for manufactured outrage and the most obvious perspectives (e.g. the recent clash between Kim Woodburn and regular panellist Coleen Nolan).When Katie Price became a regular in 2016, it seemed as if it might finally be time to put viewers out of their misery. But after 19 years and more than 3,000 episodes, the programme shows no signs of stopping. The average woman’s life is 83 years, but Loose Women could outlive us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5812e20ccfaeb409638eb0b313bba5106615d239/0_0_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=623fa914c27844e39c63f05f4be1f916","title":"mothers day review gut wrenchingly hard to watch but hugely inspiring","story":"This was a touching, human, desperately sad drama about the IRA attack in Warrington that proved to be the catalyst for peace plus an innovative way of exploring the devastation wrought on the families of convicted paedophilesA woman sits in a hospital, consumed by anguished thought and accompanied by the sound of someone breathing through a ventilator.

And, across the Irish Sea in Dublin, another mother, Susan McHugh (Vicky McClure), says enough is enough and organises a public meeting that will lead to the Peace 93 campaign. Still not easy to watch, but at least not without hope.The story is not over-sentimentalised or Hollywoodified. McHugh isn’t portrayed as the saviour who brought peace to Northern Ireland merely as a small voice in that process. Just as Tim Parry – who along with three-year-old Johnathan Ball was killed in Warrington – are just two of 157 children who lost their lives during the Troubles. And the Warrington bombings were part of a vast, complex story.What Mother’s Day does is provide a way into that story – a touching, human, desperately sad, but ultimately inspiring way in.Equally hard to watch, also extraordinary: Married to a Paedophile (Channel 4). Even the process of making this is fascinating: it was first recorded as an audio documentary, with two families talking about their husbandsfathers being convicted of possessing indecent images. It was then filmed as a drama with actors lip-syncing the real people’s words. It does look a bit weird if you watch out for it, but it’s easy to forget and just go with it.What it provides is authenticity as well as anonymity for the participants – the importance of which is underlined when “Kate”, who lives in fear, shows the film-maker Colette Camden some of the things being said on social media: “Sod their human rights, got to wonder about the wife, this woman must be a whore.” That kind of thing. You just have to hope, for the actors’ sake, that any watching vigilante not known for their intelligence understands the process.Anyway, it means “Kate”, her convicted partner, their two daughters and “Helen” talk frankly of the trauma, betrayal and shame they feel. The result is a revealing exploration of the most difficult subject.God, what kind of return to work is this? A couple of days ago, I was in sunny Greece, drinking ouzo in my Speedos I come back to work, September, terrorist attacks and paedophiles. Shut up, though. I may not be the victim here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d20d1e687a67418bf3a452ce742e070f97be972/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aaf61df1502252a422932f6283f51a9","title":"new york west indian day parade jouvert festival","story":"More than a million people expected to attend annual Brooklyn events, beginning with J’Ouvert festivalMost of Brooklyn was quiet on Monday morning, as the Labor Day weekend continued. But the Crown Heights neighborhood was different. Musicians struck steel drums and people blasted reggae music from their sound systems, in New York City’s largest Caribbean celebration.More than a million people were expected to attended the annual J’Ouvert festival and West Indian Day parade. People covered in paint and wearing Caribbean flags as capes, skirts and headbands danced on street corners and stoops. Others wore enormous, brightly colored headdresses and intricate jeweled outfits as they weaved through stalls selling jerk chicken and roti. Ebony Smith said she had been coming to the festival for more than 20 years. This year she brought her daughter, Emani, for the first time. “She experiences so much of the American way of life,” said Smith, who wore a Jamaica headband. “I want her to experience the different cultures.”Zxavier Simpson has been attending for more than 15 years. He also felt it was important for children to attend.“As a kid,” he said, “this was a feast, seeing all the flags coming together, seeing everyone enjoy each other.”Simpson said he planned to broadcast the parade on social media, adding: “It’s a privilege to be here.”Events kicked off with the daybreak festival, J’Ouvert, which commemorates the emancipation of Trinidadian slaves and is a warm-up for the West Indian Day parade, which runs from 11am to 6pm.Rasudar Allen had woken up at 4am after finishing his intricate costume, a mishmash of fabric scraps covering a donkey shape, just after midnight. He said he planned to spend the day clad in the patchwork burrokeet, or donkey-man, costume, a Trinidad and Tobago tradition, because the festival was “very important in keeping the Caribbean and African culture alive”.“The artistic people that makes these costumes are able to display their talents,” he said.Longtime festival-goers said it was now a much different experience compared to decades ago, when the event attracted a significantly smaller police presence. In 2017, following a wave of shootings, the city introduced security measures including moving J’Ouvert to 6am instead of 4am and closing the parade route to the public on the previous night. On Monday, the New York City police department had checkpoints, vehicles and thousands of officers scattered across both parade routes and the streets between."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e562e1db22a1080d6c01eb7aa41972be1d9ee41/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a547fe6ea39fe8dc59a34dadeee045e","title":"steve bannon new yorker festival dropped","story":"Magazine rescinds invitation after guests including Jim Carrey and Judd Apatow pledge to withdraw from eventThe announcement that Steve Bannon would headline the New Yorker Festival in October caused a storm of controversy on Monday, leading a Pulitzer-winning writer to complain, guests to pull out and the invitation to be swiftly withdrawn.The magazine’s editor, David Remnick, first told the New York Times he would interview the former Trump aide and chief White House strategist in front of a live audience, with “every intention of asking him difficult questions and engaging in a serious and even combative conversation”.Bannon’s espousal of far-right views and ties to white nationalist and alt-right groups have made him a polarising figure.She then provided a New Yorker email address.Schulz won a Pulitzer prize in 2016 for The Really Big One, a piece about the likelihood of a huge earthquake hitting the US west coast.She added: “I dearly love the magazine and I’m daily grateful to be a part of it. But I also believe that we owe those things we love the gift of honest criticism. (Also that we owe our own conscience obedience.)”Late on Monday, in a note announcing the cancellation of the interview that was immediately tweeted by staff writers, Remnick justified the invitation. It would not have provided an “unfiltered” platform for Bannon’s “‘ideas’ of white nationalism, racism, anti-semitism and illiberalism”, he said, adding that “to interview Bannon is not to endorse him”.But he said: “I don’t want well-meaning readers and staff members to think that I’ve ignored their concerns. I’ve thought this through and talked to colleagues – and I’ve re-considered. I’ve changed my mind. There is a better way to do this.”He added: “Our writers have interviewed Steve Bannon for the New Yorker before, and if the opportunity presents itself I’ll interview him in a more traditionally journalistic setting as we first discussed, and not on stage.”Bannon managed Donald Trump’s campaign in the final months of the 2016 election and was chief White House strategist until August the following year. He left in the aftermath of the deadly extremist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.In January this year he lost his role at Breitbart News and was excommunicated from Trump’s circle after he was extensively quoted in Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff’s explosive tell-all about the Trump White House. In his note, Remnick said Bannon had “exerted enormous impact on Trump” and “has not retired”.“His attempt to get Roy Moore elected in Alabama failed,” Remnick wrote, “but he has gone on to help further the trend of illiberal, nationalist movements around the country and abroad.” Bannon has travelled widely, passing comment on politics and supporting rightwing groups. In March, he appeared at an event staged by the Financial Times in New York. On Monday, an interview was broadcast on Australian television. On 9 September, the second anniversary of the day Hillary Clinton called Trump supporters “deplorables”, Bannon will release a film entitled Trump@War. He told Axios: “If you’re a deplorable, you’ll literally be standing on your chair with your pitchfork saying: ‘I’ve got to get people out to vote.’”On Monday, Bannon did not immediately respond to written requests for comment.Schulz thanked readers “for the unequivocal public response”, then asked angry Twitter users not to cancel their subscriptions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a56cc12732b650700225c92112bfd317755c141/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=842b928ff61be015ea648f1bdc95bf09","title":"russian tv launches series devoted vladimir putins weekly activities","story":"Show praises president’s physique, love of children and ability to drive away bearsVladimir Putin’s “wonderful” physique and his love for children have been hailed in the first episode of a new television programme devoted to the Russian president’s weekly activities.Moscow. Kremlin. Putin, which aired at prime time on Sunday evening on the Rossiya 1 state television channel, also joked that even wild animals were afraid of the Kremlin strongman.The hour-long show aired hours after thousands of people had marched near Red Square to protest against unpopular pension reforms that have driven the president’s approval ratings to a four-year low.It praised Putin’s willingness to “take responsibility” for the “necessary” reforms, but made no mention of the protests.After a segment on Putin’s attitude to young people, the presenter Vladimir Soloviev said: “When Putin talks to the mother of a child or looks at a child, it’s clear how much he loves children. He has a human, sincere attitude toward children.”Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman and studio guest, replied: “Putin doesn’t only love children, he loves people in general.”TV Dozhd, an online opposition channel, likened the Rossiya 1 show to the Soviet-era personality cult around Vladimir Lenin. Other critics expressed disbelief that state media could find more space for coverage of Putin among its already wall-to-wall coverage of the president. Rossiya 1 devoted more airtime to Putin than all the other candidates combined in the run up to March’s presidential elections.The programme also featured footage of Putin’s recent holiday in Tuva, a remote region in Siberia. “This is wild nature, there are bears there,” Peskov said. “Bodyguards are armed in an appropriate manner, just in case. Although if a bear sees Putin – they aren’t idiots – they will behave themselves properly.”Amid the relentless praise for Putin there was also an unexpected mention of the prominent Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.During a segment about a meeting between Putin and some students in Sochi, a teenage boy called Yegor Ryabov could be seen wearing a “Navalny 2018” T-shirt partly covered by a grey hooded top. Navalny, who was barred from this year’s presidential campaign, is blacklisted by state media.Ryabov said he had covered up the T-shirt during a briefing with Kremlin security officers before the meeting but unzipped his top when Putin appeared.“This was an act of political disobedience,” Ryabov said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eb12371ed514fd417050e34a132583dbbfa2cdb/0_94_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aad6c84378dc3be98728c174db20819b","title":"corruption incompetence and a musical naurus riches to rags tale","story":"The once-wealthy island now barely survives on income from Australia’s detention regime and is pinning its economic hopes on undersea miningNauru is banking on fields of mineral-rich smooth brown rocks about the size of a potato that lie on the sea floor around the tiny island as the possible saviour of its fragile economy.For the island nation of just 10,000 people, financial viability has been a pressing problem since the exhaustion of its rich phosphate deposits in the 1970s.The nodules that lie 4km below the sea might be the answer. They are rich in the metals that are essential for the clean-energy industry: nickel, cobalt and manganese.The deep-sea mining venture needed to tap the resource is being led by a Canadian company, DeepGreen, which is run by an Australian entrepreneur, Gerard Barron, and backed by mining giant Glencore and shipping company Maersck. It is in the exploration phase but results are promising and it hopes to begin mining in 2025.For Nauru it will be just in time.At the moment Nauru’s main industry could perhaps be described as misery and suffering, courtesy of Australia’s offshore detention policies. Since 2013, when the offshore detention and processing centre reopened, Australia has been providing about two-thirds of Nauru’s GDP of $170m by way of direct aid, visa fees and payments to the government for hosting the refugees.But with hundreds of refugees sent to Nauru being resettled in the US and others moved to Australia, that industry is winding down, posing a new economic challenge for the troubled island nation.The story of tiny Nauru, once one of the wealthiest states per capita in the world, is a tale of rapacious colonialism, epic mismanagement, and avarice.Australia, New Zealand and Britain had nearly exhausted the viable deposits of phosphate by 1968 when Australia granted Nauru sovereignty, leaving behind one of the world’s worst environmental disasters.It might look like a Pacific island paradise but, thanks to phosphate mining, its interior is a moonscape of jagged limestone pinnacles unfit for agriculture or even building.There was talk in 1963 and again in 1970 of moving the 10,000 inhabitants to an island off Queensland, which the Nauruans opposed. Instead, the islanders have soldiered on as one of the smallest and most geographically isolated nations.The royalties from phosphate accumulated in a trust by the Nauruans – worth A$1.7bn at its peak – were squandered in the years following independence.By 2002, Nauru had stopped paying its loans, which had blown out thanks to the devaluation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar. GE Capital, which was owed US$239m on mortgaged properties, sent in the receivers.The assets, which included the 50-storey Nauru House in Collins Street, Melbourne, the Downtowner Motel in Carlton and the Mercure Hotel in Sydney, are long gone.A series of corrupt and incompetent governments found extravagant and spectacular ways to lose the country’s wealth, including, notoriously, funding a disastrous West End musical based on the life of Leonardo da Vinci.Nauru spent years in desperate penury as the country ran out of money. Its central bank went broke, its real estate overseas was repossessed, its planes seized from airport runways.As the financial crisis engulfed the island, it turned to exploiting its sovereignty. During the 1990s it transformed into a money-laundering haven selling banking licences and passports, including diplomatic passports, which confer immunity. Customers included the Russian mafia and al-Qaida.An estimated $70bn in Russian mafia money went through Nauru’s banks in 1998 alone.In 2002, the US treasury designated Nauru as a money-laundering state, alongside Ukraine, and imposed tough sanctions rivalling those slapped on Iraq.“Nauru is notorious for permitting the establishment of offshore banks with no physical presence in Nauru or in any other country,” the US treasury said. “These banks maintain no banking records that Nauru or any other jurisdiction can review. The evidence indicates that the entities that obtain these offshore banking licenses are subject to cursory and wholly inadequate review by the country’s officials and lack any credible ongoing supervision.”The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body that works to eliminate tax havens, has been working with Nauru to walk back from its foray into the wild west of finance.By 2004 Nauru had passed anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws and the offshore banking sector seems to have disappeared as fast as it arrived.As of 2012, when the FATF reviewed Nauru, there were only 59 corporations registered under Nauru law, with a number of those pending for being struck off the registry. Fewer than five corporations per year have been registered over the past five years. In the past 10 years no new trust company licences have been issued, although 15 unit trusts have been formed under the 11 existing unit trust licences.However, it remains a secretive destination and learning anything about Nauru’s corporate sector remains difficult. There is no corporations registry online, and websites advertising tax havens still list Nauru as an option.In 2016, Westpac pulled out of providing banking on Nauru, citing concerns about compliance with international money-laundering regulations in a letter to customers. The only bank on the island is the Bendigo Bank, which opened in 2015.A few weeks ago the finance minister, David Adeang, announced that Nauru was fully compliant with the European Commission’s tax and financial security regulations, and had been removed from its grey list, although the EU has not yet published a formal statement.“Since the election of the Waqa government in 2013 we have worked very hard to lift Nauru’s international reputation, which was damaged over so many years by many former administrations due to greed and corruption,” Adeang said at an EU international tax seminar in Fiji last month.Nauru’s economy has also improved since 2013, thanks to one industry: refugee detention and processing for Australia.The first Nauru offshore detention experiment began in 2001, after the Tampa crisis. This was the catalyst for Australia to set up the camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.It ran until 2007. The camp was bedevilled by problems: overcrowded tents and a shortage of water were the most pressing. Slowly it was established that, overwhelmingly, those who had come by boat were not “queue jumpers” or criminals or terrorists but rather people fleeing genuine persecution and who were owed protection. Most were resettled, and mostly in Australia.Nauru’s second iteration as an isle of detention, instituted by a Labor government and carried on with unswerving determination by the current Liberal-National Coalition government, began in 2012.The problems are undiminished. But the second Nauru detention regime, now formally replaced with a resettlement program on the island, has been kept carefully hidden. Foreign journalists – save for a handful of selected reporters – are forbidden entry to the island.The financial cost has been enormous. In 2017 a Senate committee was told Australia’s offshore immigration detention program – Nauru and Manus – had cost the federal government at least $5bn since 2012.Only part of that flowed to the economies of Nauru and PNG, as many of the functions needed to keep the reprocessing centres running – maintenance, garrisoning, legal assistance, welfare and health services – are provided by fly-in-fly-out Australian firms.But there are benefits. The Nauru government is paid resettlement fees, reimbursements towards the cost of its public services, jobs for locals and increased economic activity.That now raises the difficult question of what happens when Australia leaves.The dependence of Nauru on Australia and its offshore detention policies is revealed in Nauru’s own budget papers for 2018-19. Australia is responsible for directly providing at least two-thirds of Nauru’s revenue, which last year was $167m. It reported a balanced budget in 2017-18, spending all but a tiny slither.Australian aid makes up a big share: $26m in 2018-19 , even as Australia has sought to prune its aid spending overall. This is despite the Department of Foreign Affairs’ own assessments for 2016-17 that the core programs in education and health are failing to meet benchmarks. The assessment on health slipped from amber to red.But there are also big licks of money coming from visa resettlement fees ($21m), reimbursements to Nauru’s department of justice and border control ($8.2m), and fees to the Nauru Regional Processing Centre corporation ($14m), which provides local staff.Australians coming and going from the island have breathed new life into Nauru Airlines, the only way to reach the island, while port charges are up and a major upgrade of the port, funded by the Asian Development Bank and Australia, is under way.Government spending has tracked up at the same pace as revenue, leaving the island vulnerable to a sudden change in circumstance.The Nauru government knows that the boom is coming to an end.In the short term, Nauru might get a bigger slice of the pie as Australian companies leave and hand over to the Nauru Regional Processing Centre Corporation in October.But after that the future is precarious.Most of the utilities, mining and even the shops and supermarket are controlled by Nauruan state government companies that did not file financial statements in time for the budget papers, so it’s hard to say what shape they are in.Eigigu, which runs the supermarkets, hotels and shops, is in dispute over its hotel in the Marshall Islands, which is closed.Mining of remnant phosphate deposits has slowed to a dribble. Nauru Rehabilitation Corporation (NRC), which took over mining operations in the last few years, is handing it back to Ronphos, the government-owned phosphate company, from July 1.In 2018-19 it is budgeting on making just $22m from phosphate but will spend $27.5m mining it, the budget papers say. The deficit is being funded by a loan from the Taiwanese government and only a quarter of the new equipment needed has been purchased.With little phosphate left, this appears to amount to shuffling of the deckchairs on the Titanic.As for rehabilitation of the island, the progress has been glacial.The NRC was set up after a financial settlement in 1993 by Australia of $135m in belated recognition of the environmental disaster it had wreaked on the island.NRC originally had a target of rehabilitating 400 hectares at the rate of 20 ha a year, but so far it has only rehabilitated a small area known as pit 6, which is being used as the site of the jail.The $135m appears to be gone. The budget papers say NRC’s balance sheet shows “a deficit in net worth” and that “future (donor and or Nauru government) external funding will be required for the NRC future work.”Meanwhile, Nauru is running out of land.The other big earner in recent years has been fishing. The government earned $43.14m last financial year in fees paid by foreign-flagged vessels to undertake what is called “purse seine fishing”. This involves putting out several kilometres of net in a circle, which is then closed from the bottom with a drawstring, trapping tuna and other species.The Nauru government has recently invested in two Korean-flagged tuna boats in an effort to secure a bigger cut of the fishing industry.The DeepGreen undersea mining project will need to be balanced with protecting these marine resources.DeepGreen has undertaken three exploration voyages and plans four more. It says the resource has proved very promising, with high concentrations of the mineral-rich nodules on the seafloor at a depth of 4km. It plans to begin commercial mining in 2025.Nauru’s president, Baron Waqa, is hopeful the venture will bring great benefits.“My government continues to look for other revenue sources for Nauru. Not just now, for the future. This venture with DeepGreen will ensure that our revenue will be well ersified for our children and their children well into the future,” Waqa said after the company reported that it had found significant resources in the territory around Nauru.DeepGreen’s Gerard Barron said under the agreement with Nauru, the company will pay royalties of “tens of millions” a year and make a significant contribution to the island’s GDP.The company is already offering training and job opportunities to Naruans on its exploration voyages. Barron believes undersea mining for minerals could be as transformative for the Pacific as oil was for the Middle East.“They’re the metals we need to build electric vehicle batteries, to build renewable energy storage, to build electricity-generating windmills and solar panels. At DeepGreen we call them metals for our future,” he said.But undersea mining is controversial. The Solwarra project, being undertaken by Nautilus Minerals off the coast of PNG, involves excavating and crushing up volcanic vents on the seafloor and then pumping the rubble to the surface. It’s been opposed by local communities and environmental groups.Barron says mining nodules has far less impact: the loose nodules are vacuumed up and pumped to the surface, with the residual water then pumped back down to avoid disturbing ocean temperatures.In anticipation of the end of the detention centre business, Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand and the Asian Development Bank have also begun paying into the Nauru Intergenerational Trust Fund, a sovereign wealth fund being managed by a board of donor representatives and Australian accounting firms.Its proceeds, currently $56m, cannot be spent until it builds to a critical mass. Nauru will make contributions, depending on its income each year. put detailed questions to the Nauru government but it did not respond."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3612579.1535640098!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pricewatch retaining old number proves too much for eir","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe company refused to let the customer speak to a supervisor.Last July John Farrar signed up for a broadband and landline package with eir and specifically asked that his phone number be retained as he has elderly relatives in Australia and the UK. “I received an email outlining my contract with the inclusion of my phone number,” he writes. “Broadband was obtained within 24 hours which was great but there was no phone. The technician said he had no knowledge of any instruction to connect a phone.”So poor John made 14 phone calls to eir but its automated service didn’t recognise his phone number. When he spoke to eir staff he was told that he didn’t order a landline that his number had been allocated to someone else and could not be retrieved and he was asked why he wanted his old number anyway as he didn’t appear to use it all that much.Then he asked them to review the recording of his verbal order, they said they had to raise “a ticket” and he would have to wait 30 days and then ring them to re-apply. They refused to let him speak to a supervisor.When he tried to make a complaint he was instructed to email ccm@eir.ie. “I did this and received a reply asking to confirm my details which I did. After almost a week, I received a reply that the address supplied was slightly different from the billing address listed, even though my address has not changed for 22 years. I re-confirmed adding my eircode and received the same response. I contacted eir through Facebook and was told that the email address I had used to make the complaint was not in use and if I wanted to complain, I needed to go onto the eir website and click on complaints.”He says that one of the parameters in the complaint section asks for a contact phone number. “As I didn’t have a landline I tried to enter my mobile number. However, the form does not allow the entry of a mobile prefix as there is a dropdown box with listed prefixes but not any for mobile phones. I left it blank but the form was returned indicating that a phone number was a required field.”The next day he rang and cancelled his account and was informed that as he did not receive all the products he was not subject to an early cancellation charge. “I was told that technically I was still subject to a cooling off period. Happy days.”He signed up with Sky and has “to say they were a breath of fresh air and everything was up and running within 48 hours. They said it would take two to three days to obtain my old number and offered us a choice of temporary numbers. After a further 24 hours I got an email to say that my original number was now live.”He thought that was the end of it until last week when he got the following text. “We’re sorry to hear that you are cancelling your services with us. As you are still within your minimum contract term, you must pay an early service cancellation charge. We will charge you this fee after your services cease. For more information please call 1800 303451. From eir.”So he tried calling the number and an automated message said the number was no longer in use and to ring 1901, which he did. Except now his account number was not recognised, so he could not be put through to anyone.“I went back on Facebook messenger and got a reply telling me to ring another 1800 number, but of course I got a message to say the office was closed until Monday. I’m 54 and in all my time I have never experienced anything like it!”We contacted eir and a spokesman sent us the following statement: “In this particular case the customer’s order for a home phone was misplaced as voice-over-broadband rather than a dedicated phone line. As his old phone number was with another provider it would not have been recognised in our systems and they had not made it available to us to use by the time the customer called. “The text message regarding cancellation charges was issued in error. We apologise for that and the message system has been reviewed and corrected.

Photo: Nick Bradshaw The Church of Ireland community is being “torn apart” due to controversy over enrolment policies at a school which is giving priority to children who regularly attend church services, it has been claimed.Rev Edgar Swann, the former chairman of the board of management at St Patrick’s National School in Greystones, Co Wicklow, has written to the Archbishop of Dublin to say the controversy is bringing the church into “public ridicule” and has called for the current board to be dissolved.“The matter is damaging the school, which has lost excellent teachers, and it is causing a serious crisis in the parish,” he stated.His intervention follows the resignation of a long-serving principal, Eileen Jackson, at St Patrick’s National School in protest over its “parish engagement” enrolment policy.Parents at the school last week overwhelmingly voted to back the principal and urged the board be dissolved at an extraordinary general meeting of its parent-teacher association.The Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Michael Jackson, the school’s patron, has refused to dissolve the board of management in the face of calls to do so by parents.He acknowledged that while St Patrick’s was facing challenging times, there was no evidence that the board was “dysfunctional”.In his letter to the Archbishop, Rev Swann, the former rector for Greystones, expresses serious concern at the developments.“I have no wish to interfere in the internal matters of my old parish and school, but I find I can be silent no longer,” he wrote.“I would respectfully suggest that the only way forward here is the dissolution of the board, a time for healing and a completely new beginning. If this does not come from the patron, it may well be precipitated by the Minister for Education.“This matter is damaging the school, which has lost excellent teachers and it is causing a serious crisis in the parish.“There is a serious feeling among the parent body that no one in authority will engage with them. There is frustration and anger and it is mounting by the day.“You can of course ignore this letter, but it is breaking my heart to see what is happening and it will not bode well for the school or parish and it brings the Church of Ireland into public ridicule.”In a statement at the weekend, Archbishop Jackson said the school ethos and decisions by the board will remain unchanged.“The board of management will continue to manage the school and the school will continue to educate the children entrusted to its care,” he said.Board of management sources say the enrolment policy has been in place for four years and feel the controversy is linked to its decision to turn down an extra teacher.Some sympathetic to the board also feel much parental opposition is linked to a secular agenda.The parents’ subcommittee of St Patrick’s parent-teacher association, meanwhile, has expressed its regret that the patron had not responded to its request to discuss ways of resolving issues at the school.“Respectfully, it is suggested that the patron might wish to hear from all stakeholders before making any decisions or public pronouncements in this matter,” the sub-committee said, in a statement."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"More training places for students who wish to teach subjects lacking qualified educatorsOwners of Spanish vessel held off southwest says Irish authorities misinterpreted EU rulesFormer rector says row is damaging school and causing \u0026lsquoserious crisis\u0026rsquo in Greystones parishNSAI urges students to ensure their housing meets health and safety requirementsBusinessman Gavin Duffy gets backing for Aras bid from councillors in MeathGarda\u0026iacute discover cannabis herb during motorway stop-and-search in DublinAsylum seekers more likely to receive deportation orders in August when solicitors on leave, says lawyerMartin says aim is to \u0026lsquoset out a realistic agenda for renewal\u0026rsquo of Catholic ChurchSecond Irish competitor takes silver at championship in GermanyThe group will spend its National Lottery winnings on \u0026lsquomortgages, loans and holidays\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoAn extraordinary nurse-led service that offers respite, shelter, recognition\u0026rsquo to homelessParents say Joshua Allen (18) held over \u0026euro30,000 seizure, made a \u0026lsquohuge mistake\u0026rsquo and admitted guiltLeithrim council should conduct exit interviews with traders who shut, officials toldPolice in the North are searching for prisoner last seen on three-wheel mobility scooterSiptu members planning stoppage on September 18thBomb warning came ahead of assassination attempt on Oliver J Flanagan, father of the current Minister for Justice, Charlie FlanaganVan crashed into a wall in Co Offaly on Tuesday afternoonDriver claims \u0026lsquotip-off\u0026rsquo was malicious, but WRC dismisses unfair dismissal caseAlleged assault is recorded following All-Ireland football final on Sunday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3616889.1536007150!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gavin duffy calls for derry to kerry rail road broadband corridor","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential hopeful Gavin Duffy said if Dublin continues to expand its population at existing rates, it will ‘end up sliding in the sea’. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Presidential hopeful Gavin Duffy has called for the development of a rail, road and broadband corridor from Derry to Kerry to try and counter the growing imbalance between Dublin and the West coast.Mr Duffy said he believed that the benefits of the prosperity currently being enjoyed by Dublin needs to spread out into the provinces. He said if Dublin continues to expand its population at existing rates, it will “end up sliding in the sea”.He was speaking to members of Kerry County Council when seeking their support for a presidential nomination.He believed in particular that the West needed public infrastructure investment to enable to attract companies into the region. While motorways had been constructed, they all radiated out from Dublin and did not connect various parts of the western seaboard, he said.Mr Duffy said while he understood the constitutional restrictions of the presidency, he believed that there was scope within the office for encouraging enterprise and ensuring a fairer distribution of economic benefits to every region.“ I believe there should be a rail, road and broadband corridor running from Derry to Kerry to help development along with western seaboard,” he said.Mr Duffy who got the backing of Meath County Council on Monday , was the first of four candidates to address the specially convened meeting of Kerry County Council at its chamber in Tralee and it was notable that after his address, several councillors left the chamber.However musician Jimmy Smyth of The Bogey Boys was undeterred as he took the podium. He was given a warm welcome by Sinn Féin Cllr Pa Daly who recalled him playing in Tralee with U2 as the support act and he congratulated him on not losing his voice unlike Bono in Berlin on Sunday night.Mr Smyth said he wanted to clarify comments attributed to him where was reported as saying he believed that President Michael D Higgins was the best candidate for the job. He had indeed said that but the press had failed to report the caveat - “apart from myself”.He said he had great respect for President Higgins and how he had performed as president as he recalled that he knew Michael D before he was even a Labour TD and used to book the Boogie Boys for gigs in Galway.Mr Smyth said he had been briefly a member of Sinn Féin as he was frustrated with the failure of the establishment parties to ensure an equitable society and he still could not understand how, in a relatively wealthy country like Ireland, young families were ending up homeless.Journalist, Gemma O’Doherty told Sinn Féin Cllr Toireasa Ferris she had been the victim of a vendetta in recent days where she was being depicted as anti-Muslim and nothing was further from the truth as she campaigned for equality and fairness and a corruption-free Ireland.In her work as a journalist where she has focused on exposing corruption, she said she had worked closely with a number of Imams to highlight challenges facing the Muslim population in Ireland while she had also championed transgender people and Travellers and was an advocate for minorities.Highlighting corruption had led to her being treated as a pariah but she told Fianna Fail Cllr John Joe Culloty she would not run for Dáil Éireann as she did not believe the Dáil was serving the interests of the people because of the confidence and supply deal between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.Artist, Seamus Nolan explained he is seeking to get on the ballot paper as William Delaney 1957-1970. William Delaney died in 1970 aged 13, three years into a six-year sentence for stealing a loaf of bread, at St Joseph’s Industrial School in Letterfrack, Co GalwayMr Nolan said his campaign was aimed at highlighting William’s story and that of the 146 other children who died at Letterfrack while in the care of the Christian Brothers between 1869 and 1969.He told Kerry County Mayor Cllr Norma Foley that in the unlikely event of him getting a nomination and winning the presidential election he would not take up the office and another vote would have to be held, but he would have achieved his aim of highlighting the plight of industrial school victims.Cllr Foley thanked the four candidates for their presentations and explained that councillors would vote at their next meeting on September 17th on whether the council would support any of the four candidates in their bid for a presidential nomination.Ms O’Doherty has denied that she raised concerns the State was involved in the murder of investigative reporter Veronica Guerin as a means of highlighting her bid to obtain a presidential nomination.She said she had mentioned Guerin’s murder at a public meeting in Waterford on corruption when asked about it by a member of the audience but it had nothing to do with her bid to obtain a presidential nomination.“I was asked about Veronica Guerin at a public meeting on corruption in Waterford, I did not raise Veronica Guerin, it (her murder) is not a priority for me,” she said.“This idea that I am seeking publicity- what an outrageous thing to say, that is the last thing I would do - I am a very private person,” said Ms O’Doherty who stressed she has never raised Ms Guerin’s murder at any presentation she made to county councils when seeking a presidential nomination.Ms O’Doherty was speaking after addressing Kerry County Council where she did not mention Ms Guerin’s murder.Ms O’Doherty said she was reluctant to discuss the matter as it was not part of her campaign for the presidency.However she said that she believed that Ms Guerin had been murdered on foot of collusion between the state and criminals as she was about to expose collusion between Garda investigators and criminals in a number of high profile cases.Asked what evidence she had of her claim , Ms O’Doherty said she was reluctant to speak about it as it was not part of her bid to obtain a presidential nomination.She said she had examined Ms Guerin’s articles into Garda collusion with criminals and she had put them into the public domain in recent days and “the facts speak for themselves” in substantiating her belief Ms Guerin had been targeted because she was about to expose this collusion.Asked about the upset that her comments had caused Ms Guerin’s family including her brother, Jimmy who said the family found her comments offensive and upsetting, Ms O’Doherty said it was never her intention to cause upset to anyone."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3617321.1536009801!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joan freeman receives presidential nomination from cork city council","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPieta House founder Senator Joan Freeman has received the backing of Cork City Council for her first nomination to contest the presidential election .   Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill Independent Senator Joan Freeman received her first nomination from Cork City Council on Monday night to run for the presidency.Nine Fianna Fail councillors and four independents, including Lord Mayor Cllr Mick Finn and one Fine Gael councillor backed her after hearing a presentation where she spoke about how she would highlight mental health if elected to the Aras.There were 11 abstentions from Fine Gael, Sinn Fein and Solidarity councillors.Afterwards the Pieta House founder said she was deeply gratefull to Cork City Council and said that she always had fond memories of Cork from her work here with Pieta House and the city had again come good for her in her bid to get a presidential nomination.“I am sbsolluely thrilled and for this to happen in Cork , I never expected it. It’s the first council to nominate me . I go to Roscommon on Wednesday and then back her to Cork County Council on Friday but I am absolutely delighted with this result here tonight.” Ms Freeman needs four nominations to secure a place on the ballot paper. Senator Freeman was one of six candidates to address Cork City Council together with businessman Gavin Duffy, farmer John Groarke, Donald Trump admirer Sarah Louise Mulligan, journalist, Gemma O’Doherty and musician, Jimmy Smyth.Earlier on Monday businessman Gavin Duffy received his first nomination after Meath County Council voted for him. Mr Duffy secured 17 votes, followed by businessman Seán Gallagher with 7 and Ms Freeman who received 2. Of the 40 councillors, 11 abstained and 3 were absent.At least 12 county and city councils are expected to hold votes to nominate Independent candidates for the presidential election this week, with businessman Seán Gallagher the frontrunner to get the first endorsement.Ten prospective candidates have already addressed councils with an 11th, businessman and Dragons’ Den panellist Peter Casey expected to address Leitrim County Council on Monday.A number of other councils are expected to vote on presidential nominations, or hear submissions from candidates. They are Meath, Cork City, Leitrim, Kerry and Monaghan. Other councils who will hear from councillors in the next week include Clare, Roscommon, Fingal, Offaly and Cavan, which is expected to endorse Mr Gallagher.Wexford was due to discuss nominations but the meeting has been adjourned following the death of the mother of the council chairman, Keith Doyle.Mr Gallagher is believed to have secured sufficient backing in Leitrim, Roscommon, Cavan and Wexford, which will give him the required minimum of four local authorities.On Monday Mr Duffy addressed Kerry County Council and called for the development of a rail, road and broadband corridor from Derry to Kerry to try and counter the growing imbalance between Dublin and the West coast.Mr Duffy said he believed the benefits of the prosperity currently being enjoyed by Dublin needs to spread out into the provinces. He said if Dublin continues to expand its population at existing rates, it will “end up sliding in the sea”.Mr Duffy said while he understood the constitutional restrictions of the presidency, he believed that there was scope within the office for encouraging enterprise and ensuring a fairer distribution of economic benefits to every region.On Monday Mr Gallagher told Leitrim County Council the Frontline programme featuring ‘tweetgate’ had “changed the outcome “of the 2011 presidential election.Mr Duffy and Ms Freeman are seen as the next most likely to secure four council endorsements.Until now Mr Duffy, Patrick Feeney, Ms Freeman, John Groarke, Marie Goretti Moylan, Sarah Louise Mulligan, Kevin Sharkey, Gemma O’Doherty and James Smyth have addressed councils."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3617254.1536002961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new sinn f%C3%A9in leader offers voters option in post adams era","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald speaking at a meeting of elected representatives in Co Cavan. Photograph: Press Association Three critical events relating to Irish politics will occur over the next two months: the budget the renegotiation of the confidence-and-supply agreement and the October deadline for UK’s orce deal on Brexit.It might not be enough to set the pulse racing but you would expect at the very least, to hear the distant sound of war drums.But when you looked around the room of the Sinn Féin pre-Dáil meeting in Cavan yesterday, it quickly became clear that no status orange warning has yet been issued for this party, or for any other party.You will find as the parties do the rounds of their September “think-ins” that the mood will be a mid-term relaxed one. No one believes the Government is going to fall on the budget. Just about everybody believes that the confidence-and-supply agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will be extended for another year, and possibly two. And the view emerging from politicians is that Brexit will require a certain amount of unity and coherence and pulling on the national jersey. And that means no prospect of a general election.That scenario probably suits Sinn Féin as much as it does the other two big parties. None of the three feel comfortable with an early election – you get the sense from all of them that the more time they have, the more they can gain in a general election. It would be hard to see all three sharing the spoils of other (smaller) parties but each see a longer run-in as advantageous.Sinn Féin has a new leader. And the new leader has a new dispensation, to pivot the party more to the South, and to mainstream it in a sense that the party can be seen as responsible, as trusted and responsible, with the prospect of attracting voters who just couldn’t bring themselves to vote Sinn Féin under Gerry Adams’ stewardship.For now, new party leader Mary Lou McDonald is an asset and the party believes she can give it electoral bounce whenever a general election is held.Certainly, her first address as leader at this meeting illustrated that new dispensation. It was an exercise in brevity and clarity: a short punchy speech that focused very much on the big issues in domestic southern politics – namely homelessness, marginalisation and rural depopulation.Adams was a politician of big ideas and big visions and was never comfortable debating the bread and butter issues, the staple of political discourse in Leinster House. In contrast, McDonald is in her element with these – the two takeaways from her speech yesterday was her attack on Eoghan Murphy as she outlined plans to table a no-confidence motion, as well as a promise to put down another motion to stop the planned closure of 159 post offices. There are few stronger parliamentary combatants.That said, there is no corollary on that for her northern outlook or for the republican vision thing. McDonald is the leader of an all-Ireland party and the party’s big preoccupations, many driven by Adams, remain the same: on a Border poll, on equality in the North, on a language act, on the impact of Brexit and the never-ending suspension of Stormont.At the heel of the hunt, the party needed a southern leader at this stage of its history and it will be the party’s status in the South that will ultimately determine how successful a leader McDonald will be. The party will announce a presidential candidate on the 16th (it will be a major shock if it is not the impressive and personable Liadh Ní Riada). That is a smart move, allowing Sinn Féin a chance to build profile and trust in a field without Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil candidates.Before McDonald became leader, Sinn Féin looked like it might tread water in the next general election, ending up with zero seat gain, or a gain of one. McDonald will be expected to bring the tally from 22 to closer to 30. It’s doable but no easy task – unless there is a dramatic turn of events."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3617130.1535996490!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"chequers proposal is absolute rubbish jacob rees mogg","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit campaigner Jacob Rees-Mogg: “I have consistently said this is about changing the policy, not the prime minister.” File photograph: Simon DawsonReutersLeading Tory eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has called on prime minister Theresa May to repudiate the December agreement with the EU on the Northern Ireland Border backstop.He said that the backstop issue was holding up the Brexit talks unnecessarily and that the British government should simply not put up a border.“I think the backstop agreement has allowed these negotiations to drag on in a most unsatisfactory manner,” said Mr Rees-Mogg, “and the answer on the Irish border is simply not to put up a border because the Irish Government say they don’t want one, the EU say they don’t want one, the British government says it doesn’t want one, and that seems to me to be a very good answer.”The backstop agreed between the EU and UK last December provides for regulatory alignment between the Republic and the North in order to avoid customs checks. It would come into effect in the absence of a wider Brexit deal providing for a frictionless Border.Mr Rees-Mogg was speaking to journalists following a meeting in Brussels\u0026nbspbetween EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and the House of Commons Committee for Exiting the EU. Earlier the group had a separate, “constructive” meeting with Irish Ambassador to the EU Declan Kelleher and his Brexit deputy, Emer Deane.Mr Rees-Mogg revelled in what he said was agreement with Mr Barnier that Ms May’s Chequers proposals were dead.“I found we were in a considerable degree of agreement that Chequers is absolute rubbish and that we should chuck it and what we should have is a Canada-style free trade deal . . . interestingly, eurosceptics and Mr Barnier were in greater agreement than eurosceptics and the government, or Mr Barnier and the government. It’s very encouraging.”He denied that his opposition to Chequers was an attack on Ms May. “I have consistently said this is about changing the policy, not the prime minister,” he said.The committee’s chairman, Labour MP Hillary Benn, said he believed that the Chequers White Paper proposals for a “facilitated customs arrangement”, which would see the UK collecting duties on behalf of the EU, and for a common regulatory rulebook, were not acceptable to the EU.“And it’s clear therefore that what is on offer is either a deal like Canada, which would not give us what we need, or my view is remaining in a customs union with the European Union. That is the only alternative potentially on the table.”He reiterated that the UK was running out of time and warned that if there is no Withdrawal Agreement there will be no transition. No deal would be a disaster for the UK, he said.Asked about his ally Boris Johnson’s qualifications to lead the Tory party, Mr Rees-Mogg replied, his tongue firmly in his cheek, “All of you here know that Brussels correspondents are enormously influential and authoritative and respected media figures, and that any one of you could be a candidate for leadership at some future date for whichever party you chose to belong. Brussels is a great training ground for leadership.”Mr Johnson served as Brussels correspondent of the Daily  in the 1990s."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

They are two flavours that go together really well and the people of Derby definitely love it, we get people asking for it at least once a week.It\u0027s especially popular among people who are a little older than teenagers.But council chiefs said the business had to apply for a licence because his rum and raisin has an alcohol content of more than 0.5Our first step would be to run a trial on putting our rum in at the start of pasteurisation process and hopefully that will burn off the alcohol content, but leave that delicious real-rum flavour.Once we have done our trial, we will send it off to the lab for testing and hopefully we can get rum and raisin back for the Derby public who love it so much.I understand the council\u0027s comments, they just have to go by the law, that is what the law says and we can\u0027t really argue with that.We have got to stick to that, alcohol is a dangerous substance, so we want to respect and honour that.It would be nice if ice cream had an exemption, but that is probably a bigger thing.But I think you would have to eat a lot of it to be affected by the booze - you probably would be sick before you felt the effects of the alcohol.The parlour has seen a surge in sales thanks to the summer heatwave.Derby City Councillor Mick Barker, lead member for licensing, said: This particular ice cream recipe contains more that 0.5 per cent alcohol, meaning it\u0027s classed as alcoholic under the Licensing Act, and a licence is needed.Rum and raisin is a classic. If Just Ice applies for a license they will be able to sell this flavour, no problem.Please review our commenting policyFamily watch axe-wielding burglars raid their south London home in terrifying doorbell footage Storm Gordon to hit US Gulf Coast as a hurricaneGlue road signs to the floor for \u0026#39zombie pedestrians\u0026#39 on their phones, Government adviser saysPower showers could be restricted and households forced to install water meters, under drought plansVanity Fair, episode 2 review: the series hit its stride with some brilliant chemistry between Frances de la Tour and Olivia Cook\u0026#39Anti-Semitic\u0026#39 Corbyn ally Peter Willsman elected to Labour\u0026#39s ruling bodyEx-Army chief: I was quizzed by cops over death of Belfast gunman 45 years agoComment: I, too, got the knock on the door from Troubles investigators.

It will literally be the big one, if leaks are to be believed: this year we\u0027ll not only get an update to the iPhone X, but also a much bigger version of that same update, equivalent to the recent Plus models.The features of that phone are largely unknown: while there have been snatches of information about the new model, they have mostly been minor and not especially interesting. That might partly be because Apple is being more secretive, but it might also be simply because there isn\u0027t all that much to say.But the outside, and its name, were spoiled last week, apparently by Apple itself accidentally making\u0026nbspsecret marketing materials\u0026nbspavailable to the public. They showed that the phone will be gold, and called the XS.Little else was revealed. But it was also interesting in what it didn\u0027t show: there was no radical redesign, no changes to the display, no special new features on show. All of that appeared to suggest that it will be very much an S year for this phone, packing in everything that\u0027s new into the inside and doing little to the outside.The 8S – or whatever it is called – is a little more of an unknown quantity. What we do know is that it will take the general design of the iPhone X but remove some of its more premium features such as its rich OLED\u0026nbspdisplay, that it will be roughly in the middle of the XS and XS Plus in terms of size, and that it will be the cheapest of the new devices.We don\u0027t know what it will be called, or how Apple will position the strange little and cheap phone. All that remains to be seen next week, pending any more embarrassing leaks from inside Apple.The Apple Watch might be the real dark horse of the event: it won\u0027t get the attention of the iPhone, of course, but it looks set for much more extreme and interesting redesign.Leaked images show that the screen could wrap across the entire front of the phone, allowing it to pack in vast amounts more information. In a year of such a redesign, its unlikely there will be any more radical changes to the inside or the features – it will get faster, probably, but not get anything much besides that – but it will be the first time the Watch has been redesigned since it was first introduced, all the way back in 2014.The real innovation might not be in the big products at all, but the accessories that go alongside them.The most exciting will be AirPower, Apple\u0027s long-promised and lesser-spotted charging mat for iPhones\u0026nbspand Apple Watches. That was first revealed at the iPhone 8 and X event, with the promise that it would be coming soon – but it\u0027s not turned up. It should arrive at this event, and if it doesn\u0027t and isn\u0027t mentioned at all it might be time to assume that it isn\u0027t coming at all.As well as that, there could be updates to the\u0026nbspAirPods\u0026nbspwireless earphones. At the very least, they\u0027ll need a new case that will allow them to charge through the\u0026nbspAirPower\u0026nbspmat, but it\u0027s possible that they will have extra features as well.Keep an eye out for the usual updates too: new cases for the new iPhones, and updates straps for the Apple Watch.Apple\u0027s tablet line is set for an upgrade, too, and it seems likely that one will arrive very soon.There have been clues that Apple is readying a new version of its tablet, even in Apple\u0027s own software. That has brought the tablet more towards the way the iPhone X works – borrowing some of the ways users navigate around without a home button – leading many to suggest that the company will inevitably bring the same design changes to the iPad as well.That will mean slimming down or completely getting rid of the bezels around the screen, and dropping the home button.But this might have their own event, next month, at least if Apple\u0027s previous form is anything to go by. The iPhone launch might get a bit busy with all of these products, and Apple might instead opt to give them their own chance to shine at a smaller event in a few weeks.Apple\u0027s pro users have long been waiting for new computers.\u0026nbspBut if there is an October event, then these will be left until then too.iPhone XS and new Apple Watch purportedly leakedApple to live stream launch of latest iPhoneApple confirms launch date for new iPhoneName of new iPhone causes problems for AppleWhenever they arrive, the updates will be plenty. There have been rumours of an update to the MacBook Air – still incredibly popular and remarkably cheap, but at this point severely lacking in updates including the Retina Display – as well as a new version of the Mac Mini.In the longer term, there\u0027s the promise of a new Mac Pro, too. But that\u0027s unlikely to turn up at this event, or the October one, or for quite some time after that. Apple has however been unusually transparent about the development of this machine, so it wouldn\u0027t be a complete surprise if they decided to mention it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/13/frestonia-1.jpg","title":"frestonia squatters london declare independence uk 1970s free independent","story":"Created with Sketch.The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born of a generation who knew counterculture as much as precarious living. Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia.

They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere.

One believes that the Labour leader’s radicalism in this area is a political weakness or a distraction that should be set aside to ensure focus on domestic policy, the party’s strength. The other side takes the view that not only are there important principles at stake, but that in fact Corbyn has some compelling iding lines to draw here with his opponents and predecessors.\u0026nbspSo long as Corbyn remains leader, it is the latter camp that is likely to win out. The prominence of foreign policy is simply an unavoidable fact of life for any British government or opposition, irrespective of any desire to focus on the domestic. The UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a nuclear power, one of a tiny minority of states capable of projecting military power on an intercontinental basis, and one of the largest economies in the world.\u0026nbspCorbyn’s stances in this area will continue to be shaped by his longstanding worldview, and the fact that the recent furore over his participation in a Palestinian wreath laying ceremony in 2014 has had no discernible effect on Labour in the polls means that there is little incentive for him to change course.\u0026nbspIt may be, however, that the underlying premise of this disagreement at the top of the party is a faulty one. Because when we look seriously at the actual substance of Labour’s foreign policy, what we find is not particularly radical. Corbyn’s personal philosophy on international affairs may be sharply different from that of the political class, but the concrete set of policies Labour espouses under his leadership are (to make a strictly analytical rather than a value judgement), mildly reformist, not revolutionary.\u0026nbspLabour’s current policy position is set out in four key texts: Corbyn’s speech to the foreign policy think tank Chatham House in May 2017, his brief speech in response to the Manchester Arena bombing that same month, a speech to the United Nations in Geneva in December 2017, and the party’s 2017 election manifesto. The defining themes throughout are the importance of international law and the UN system, the value of multilateral and inclusive dialogue to avoid or de-escalate conflict, and the urgency of tackling global poverty and inequality. Scholars of international relations looking to categorise this overall stance are likely to find liberal multilateralism –\u0026nbspa conventional tradition in the academic literature –\u0026nbspto be the closest fit.\u0026nbspThis is not to imply any sense of business-as-usual. Corbyn’s strongly sceptical view of western military interventionism, together with his critique of corporate-friendly globalisation, situate his policy platform firmly on the left-hand edge of the liberal multilateralist paradigm, and at odds with a great many of its adherents. But these are hardly off-the-wall positions in the context of numerous western policy failures (from the Iraq war to the financial crisis) over the past two decades, and align to some degree with a growing disquiet in the centre left of established thinking.\u0026nbspOne of Corbyn’s most ostensibly challenging positions was the one articulated after the bombings in Manchester during last year’s general election campaign, when he argued that a connection exists between western military interventions in the context of the “war on terror”\u0026nbspand the persistence of the terrorist threat. Again, within the academic literature on non-state violence this is an entirely mainstream and unremarkable analysis\u0026nbspwhen taken with Corbyn’s acknowledgement of the importance of other factors, such as the ideological outlook of the terrorists and their socioeconomic backgrounds. It is also a common view amongst the general public, with 53 per cent of those subsequently polled agreeing with Corbyn’s analysis versus 24 per cent who disagreed, and with voters across all parties more likely to agree with him than not. What generates near hysteria from media pundits and political opponents elicits merely a shrug elsewhere.“Radicalism”\u0026nbspis a relative term. While the formal foreign policies of Corbyn’s Labour are hardly radical when set against the spectrums of expert or public opinion, the underlying view of the international scene that guides Corbyn personally on these matters is very much at odds with that of the political class, and this perhaps is the real source of tension.AFPGetty)Like many on the left of his generation, Corbyn is a product of the 1960s peace movement, opposition to the Vietnam war, and the global campaign against apartheid. His worldview is one that sees modern international relations – specifically the large imbalances in military power and economic autonomy – as the product of centuries of formal empire, out of which a more informal system of quasi-imperialism has evolved in recent decades.\u0026nbspThis sharply contradicts the conventional wisdom of the political establishment, articulated by former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, that “if the world is increasingly ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has, for centuries, been a firefighter”. Many in the global south do not recognise this version of history, to put it mildly. For them, and for much of the grassroots left in Britain, global north states such as the UK are not inherently benign actors, and have in fact long presented a challenge, and even a danger to, the nations and peoples of the south. Evidently Corbyn shares this view – an authentically radical one in relative if not objective terms – and this rather than his formal policy programme seems to be the actual cause of the resentment from his opponents and detractors. There is a palpable sense that Corbyn is regarded by a significant number of them as not just mistaken but treacherous – his crime being a refusal to uphold the official faith in the inherent virtue of British power in the world.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesFormer Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown speaks during the \u0027Jewish Labour Movement Conference\u0027 An inflatable caricature balloon of Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan floats, near Parliament Square in London.

Corbyn’s vision of future UK relations with the global south were set out most clearly in his December 2017 Geneva speech to the UN, where he advocated for British participation in UN peacekeeping missions, a crackdown on tax havens to help protect the fiscal autonomy of developing states, a marked increase in support for refugees, and a stronger response to global warming. There is little reason to suspect that this is a mild veneer disguising a revolutionary reality. Those who knew Corbyn best during his days in the political wilderness affirm that he could never be heard expressing support for violent struggle, with the hard-left former MP George Galloway referring to him rather sniffily as a “woolly Californian”. So even in that area of foreign relations most closely associated with his radicalism – relations with the global south –there is little in his formal policy stances to seriously offend the average genuine liberal, whatever deeper philosophical differences they may have with him.This potential, practical common ground between Corbyn and more pragmatic elements of the centre left is reflected in the resemblance between his preference for dialogue over conflict and that of Barack Obama. In the American context, Obama was the reaction to George W Bush, just as Corbyn was a reaction in the British context to Bush’s valet, Tony Blair. Although each come from different political starting points, they share a scepticism that conflicts can be solved militarily, and a willingness to point to the experiences of the 2000s to underline the point.\u0026nbspObama’s presidency should not be sentimentalised in hindsight, given, to take one example, the active enabling role his administration took in Saudi Arabia’s devastating war on Yemen, and his culpability in the resulting humanitarian disaster. But on Iran at least, Obama took a view (under considerable fire from his opponents) which Corbyn would recognise, namely that diplomacy is most required precisely with people we dislike, and is almost always preferable to military conflict.\u0026nbspHere, Obama’s approach was a direct rebuke to that of his predecessor. When Iran offered a “grand bargain”\u0026nbspto the Bush administration in 2003, offering to withdraw support for Hamas and Hezbollah, sign up to the Arab peace initiative for a two-state settlement to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and submit to nuclear inspections in return for a normalisation of relations, the offer was summarily rejected by Washington on the grounds that “we don’t talk to evil”. It is likely that a lot of subsequent pain in the region could have been avoided had that door not been slammed shut, and Obama’s push for the nuclear deal during his presidency was part of an effort to revive these possibilities, reintegrate Iran into the international system and thus de-escalate wider conflicts and tensions. The other parties to the deal have worked hard to maintain it after President Trump walked away, demonstrating the fact that its strategic wisdom remains widely appreciated.Miliband (pictured with Hillary Clinton) said: ‘If the world is ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has\u0026nbspfor centuries\u0026nbspbeen a firefighter’ – a view sharply contradicted by the Labour leader\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Obama was notoriously careful about spending political capital, and his drive to secure the Iran deal resulted in weaker stances elsewhere, not least on Israel-Palestine where he showed a consistent unwillingness to apply the serious pressure on Israel that any fair resolution to the conflict will require. Israel-Palestine is the issue area where Corbyn is politically weakest due to Labour’s much discussed problems with anti-Semitism, but his policy stance itself is an entirely conventional one: support for a two-state settlement with “a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine”. Moreover, the wisdom of emphasising diplomacy over the “we don’t talk to evil” approach is clearly one that could be usefully applied to this case.When Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections, a hypothetical Prime Minister Corbyn at that time might have urged the west to take the approach it eventually took with Iran on the nuclear issue: one that says “we don’t like your ideology or your policies, but we recognise that it’s better to talk through our problems if possible”. Instead, the new government was cast beyond the pale and sanctioned, leading to a civil war between the key Palestinian parties, the isolation of Gaza, over a decade of immiserating siege, several rounds of devastating violence between Hamas and the Israeli military, and the total collapse of the peace process. The recent acceptance from Hamas of a two-state settlement (a position long in gestation within its leadership) hints at the possibilities of what might have transpired had the diplomatic approach been taken from the start. Again, a good deal of pain over the past decade might have been avoided.\u0026nbspOne of the reasons that Obama, a cautious moderate, arrived at a similar place to the more philosophically radical Corbyn in respect of the question of diplomacy over conflict is the experiences of the past decade and a half in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in Libya on his own watch. While Corbyn and Obama would disagree about whether these ventures were crimes or merely mistakes, the upshot places them in the same reality. The application of western military force is repeatedly showing itself in practice to be a futile and destructive endeavour, making the search for negotiated settlements, even in situations as unpromising as Syria, the more attractive or least unattractive proposition. Whether one likes it or not, the west is apparently unable to impose its will militarily on the global south as it once could, forcing a shift of emphasis to diplomacy irrespective of whether that is taken up with reluctance or enthusiasm.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should back a Final Say on the referendumTrump and Obama’s foreign policies are unexpectedly similarThe deeper trends in international relations are also driving in this direction. The end of the Cold War may have given the west a deceptive notion of its own omnipotence, but the slow and steady return of global south powers such as China and India to the levels of international prestige they enjoyed before the ravages of European colonialism only serves to further underline the point that a reliance on mere strength – military, diplomatic or economic – will not serve the global north states well going forward.\u0026nbspAdjusting to these new realities is proving challenging for some in Washington and London. Senior Obama aide Ben Rhodes referred contemptuously to the US foreign policy establishment as “the Blob”, in his frustration with its resistance to his boss’s approach. Across the Atlantic, one senior British general went so far as to threaten a mutiny if Corbyn made any attempt to “emasculate and shrink” the armed forces. Quite the revealing turn of phrase. But the fact remains that the experience of the “war on terror”\u0026nbsphas been a political disaster for Anglo-American militarism, creating space for less chauvinistic figures –\u0026nbspfrom Obama to Ed Miliband to Corbyn – to emerge from various points on the liberal-to-left spectrum, and raising the prospect of some significant policy changes in the future.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding the current right-wing moment in both the UK and the US, the long-term demographic trends point to an inexorable shift in the political balance of power in favour of the Democratic and Labour parties, both of whom have been experiencing internal left-wing insurgencies to varying degrees. There is now a fair prospect of a future President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren making some degree of common cause on the international stage with a future Prime Minister Corbyn. And while this would not herald a strictly revolutionary change in Anglo-American foreign relations, it would represent a very real and important departure from the days of Bush and Blair.Enter your

back to 1910, along with 2006, 2003 and 1976, all of which are within 0.03C of each other.England saw its hottest summer on record, with average temperatures narrowly beating those seen in 1976, but it is not the warmest for the other nations of the UK, the figures show.Summer 2018 was notably dry and sunny too, although the dry, sweltering conditions seen in much of the country in June and July gave way to a much more average August, the Met Office said.The Met Office\u0027s three-month outlook –\u0026nbspcovering August, September and October –\u0026nbspshows an increased chance of high-pressure patterns close to the UK.Sea surface temperatures at near-record levels following the hot weather also make above-average temperatures more likely, according to the long-range prediction system.The report said: This would result in more settled UK weather conditions overall.The likelihood of above-average temperatures is greater than normal, but while the chances of below-average temperatures are considerably smaller, they remain a realistic possibility.Additional reporting by Press AssociationEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or

had around 99,200, the Green Party 39,400, Ukip 23,600 and Plaid Cymru around 8,000.\u0026nbspSNP business convener Derek Mackay MSP welcomed the figures, which he said were boosted in June by the row over the so-called Brexit “power grab” on devolved governments.“Over 7,000 people joined the SNP in just five days in June, propelling us ahead of a waning Tory party which is at risk of imploding completely over Brexit,” he said.“Like the extraordinary membership surge of 2014 joining the SNP has once again become not just a powerful symbol, but the best way to ensure Scotland’s voice is heard.“People were rightly outraged at Tory plans to remove powers from the Scottish Parliament, and that only 15 minutes were given over at Westminster to debate the impact of the EU Withdrawal Bill on devolution.”It comes as a poll revealed Brexit has damaged support for the British union in both Scotland and Northern Ireland.Almost half of Scottish voters (47 per cent) said they would now vote for independence if the UK leaves the EU.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your

ireland presidential election 2018 dragons den independent","story":"Created with Sketch.Entrepreneur who came second in the 2011 election is now seeking a nomination to challenge Michael D Higgins again in this year’s raceClick to followThe IndependentSean Gallagher announced in August 2018 that he would be seeking a nomination for the Irish presidential electionSean Gallagher has returned to the Irish political scene and is seeking a nomination for the upcoming presidential election.The businessman, who is also a star of Dragon’s Den in Ireland, ran for the presidency once before in 2011. But after starting out as the favourite, he ended up in second place, losing out to Michael D Higgins.Originally from County Cavan, Gallagher founded a home technology business called Smarthomes in 2002, which went on to win various accolades in the business world.Between 2008 and 2011, he was an investor on the Irish version of Dragon’s Den, which brought him to greater national attention.He has been a member of Fianna Fáil\u0026nbsp- a dominant party in Irish politics - initially being part of the youth wing, and later serving on the party’s National Executive.How did he lose the 2011 presidential election?Upon entering the race for the presidency in 2011, Gallagher attempted to distance himself from Fianna Fáil, who were experiencing unpopularity at the time, following the economic crash. He contested the election as an independent, with the support of local councils.Gallagher’s energetic message and his success in business were appealing to the electorate, and he led the polls in the weeks before the election. This all came crashing down just three days before the election, during the final TV debate.Gallagher was questioned over whether he had collected a cheque from a man for €5,000, for a photograph taken with the Taoiseach at a Fianna Fáil fundraiser - an anecdote which appeared symptomatic of a perceived culture of cronyism within the party.He stumbled while attempting to put the record straight, and was met with laughter from the audience. There, on live TV, his campaign crashed. A further radio interview the following morning, which attempted to put things straight, made the situation even worse.Why is Gallagher running for president again?Described as the worst kept secret in Irish politics, Gallagher announced his second bid for the presidency at the end of August.\u0026nbspIn a statement he said, “Ireland is changing and the next president needs to provide a fresh approach at this important juncture for Ireland. We have as a people an opportunity to redefine the role of president in the context of a changing society, while cherishing all that is unique about Ireland.”\u0026nbspThis means any aspiring independents have to win the votes of 20 TDs in the Irish parliament, or the support of four county councils. It is expected that Gallagher will make his way to the ticket again through the support of councils, who he has been quietly courting across the summer.Curiously, he is not the only investor from Dragon’s Den attempting to get a nomination for this contest - both Peter Casey and Gavin Duffy are also running.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in picturesPope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

Gallagher claims he wants to serve Ireland and make it a better country, he has not made any effort to run in general, local or European elections in the past seven years, and has been absent from the referendum debates.\u0026nbspWhat are his chances of winning?The entry of Gallagher into the mix for this election is a possible game changer. Polling has showed support for him remains high, and he could perhaps even make second place again. It seems that the public have forgiven the mishap of 2011, and perhaps many even feel he was cheated out of victory.Even with the Sinn Féin candidate considered, he is likely to be the only tangible threat to the re-election of Higgins.He would represent a very different style of presidency, not just compared with the incumbent, but with all previous holders of the office. He has not held political office before, and styles himself as a self-made entrepreneur, rather than an aspiring statesman.

Danny says. The Lamborghini guys stick together. The Ferrari guys stick together.When you buy a Lamborghini, youre cruising around a lot. When you pass another Lamborghini owner, you give each other a wave.Then you meet each other at a party or club and recognise each other by the cars. This is how I built up my circle of friends.On the cruise we did on Monday it was mostly Lamborghinis, but we let in a few others as well.Today, Danny is worth around £30million and owns a fleet of eight luxury cars - including a Ferrari, a classic Aston Martin DB-5, worth over half a million pounds, and his pride and joy: a 200mph Lamborghini Diablo.He also has two other Lamborghinis, and a 1951 Mercury Custom, a classic car he bought from rapper 50 Cent. But, as hes keen to stress, the Lamborghini life didnt come easy.Before he had earned the name Danny Lambo, Danny Karne had a typical childhood, raised by two teachers in Croydon, South London.A keen musician, Dannys first big break came when his teenage band, Jealous, was scouted by a record producer for Sony Japan and he was invited to move out to the Far East to go professional.From the age of 15, he spent six years living in hotel rooms as he toured Japan with his band, sending almost all of his money back home to be saved up.It meant that by the time Danny decided to pack it in, aged 21, he had £400,000 to his name, which he vowed to grow into a multi-million pound fortune.When he left school - before completing his final exams - Danny remembers his headmaster saying that hed never get anywhere in life.But all the criticism spurred him on, and he spent every penny of his savings buying the 30-room Pavilion Hotel in Paddington.Years of living in hotels had given Danny a sense of what guests were looking for, and soon Dannys music connections had helped to turn his guest house into a destination for A-list rock stars and models.Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss were snapped hanging out there, and within a year he had made his first million, expanding his business by buying and renovating eight other nearby hotels.Danny was 23 when he bought his baby, the £300,000 purple Lamborghini Diablo which he still owns, and which has been modified to have the loudest exhaust in Britain.Because I was living at the hotel I bought the car before I had a place to live, Danny says.Id take a girl out for a cruise and shed say: lets go back to your place.Id say: This is my place, youre sleeping in the car tonight.Naturally, he also owns several luxurious homes, including a Thameside apartment which Danny has dubbed the shag pad.The flat is sleek and spacious, with views over the river, and the walls are adorned with huge paintings he commissioned - each one showing one of Dannys ex-girlfriends.Danny also keeps his designer watch collection here, with a different luxury timepiece, from Cartier to Rolex, for each day of the working week.Meanwhile, he spends his weekends in his £7.5 Mayfair mansion - which counts King George II and former PM Anthony Eden as past residents.He claims its the master bedroom here where he brings his most special ladies, although a typical evening in can see two or three female guests invited over for a few glasses of £6,000-a-bottle cognac.However, its not easy when you have so many women who want to hang out. In fact, his social life has become so hectic that hes had to employ a PA to help him manage it.Danny has a son with an ex, who lives in Moscow, but he admits that his fast-car lifestyle has made it harder to find Mrs Lambo and settle down.Ill go out like Hugh Hefner, he says. Its in the blood.And his latest song, Playboyz, which is out on Spotify, is all about the challenges of dating when you have a wild reputation for hanging out with models and fending off gold diggers.As the track goes: Playboys - theyve got the cars and the money, the cribs and the honeys... they have everything in life but they cant find love.His fame means hes had to develop a novel way to weed out gold diggers: by turning up for first dates in a Mini Cooper and saving the Lamborghini for the second meeting.But none of it has helped the 38-year-old find the right woman, although he does have a pet cat, called Mollie, who he says always comes first.Its just difficult to find a genuine girl who is with you for you - and not for what youve got, he says.Thats why the guys with supercars tend to make their cars their first loves.When you drive a car as conspicuous as Dannys, youre naturally going to attract a lot of attention.Hes often accused of being a show-off or a poser, and he has had rocks, apples and even a McDonalds strawberry milkshake thrown at his car before.You do get a lot of haters when youre cruising around on your own, Danny says. People think were flash and born with all that stuff. But weve all worked hard.I do have friends from all walks of life but I hang out with fellow supercar drivers because I know these guys arent going to be jealous of me.Dannys comeback to those who accuse him of wasting or flaunting his money is that he does a lot of work for charity which often goes unseen.He tells us that he holds collections for good causes, lets sick children ride in his luxury cars and even delivers food to homeless people in his Lamborghini.One of his recent charity projects was a bikini car wash in Piccadilly Circus where he invited the Lambo Squad to make a donation in return for having their cars scrubbed.Danny jokes that the sight of so many women and so many flash cars in one place even caused a passing driver to crash his bin lorry.But it was all worth it, since the proceeds went to the Harrison 16 Fund, a childrens cancer charity which Danny is a patron of.In addition to his charity work, and running the three hotels he still owns, Danny passes his time staging stunts, holding meet-ups and embarking on world-record attempts with his cars.He recently ate a pizza which he had cooked by holding it under the flaming exhaust of his supercar and revving the engine.Weve literally got petrol in our blood, he jokes.For Danny, the supercar life is supposedly not all about the money.I like doing creative things, he says.For my next stunt Im going to try and get into the Guinness Book of Records by fitting the most models into a Lamborghini - plus me - and driving it for 100 yards.Im trying for nine.Danny has this upcoming challenge to look forward to, as well as more Lambo Squad meet ups and coordinated cruises like the one which shut down the West End last week.And with a fleet of elite wheels in the garage, an endless stream of women throwing themselves at him and £30million under his belt already, he has no plans to slow down his 200mph life any time soon.As Danny says: Not bad for a boy from Croydon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Far left Trotskyite infiltrators — operating under the banner of the Militant Tendency — took over the city council.Under the leadership of the charismatic but confrontational Derek Hatton they were set on purging traditional Labour voices and creating Moscow on the Mersey.They ramped up tension between the city and central Government by playing politics with council jobs.Their antics provoked then Labour leader Neil Kinnock into giving one of his most famous speeches when he condemned the “grotesque chaos” of a Labour Council sending redundancy notices to its own workers by taxi. Eventually, the moderates won, Militant was defeated and the city was saved.But now, fast forward 33 years and another titanic struggle for the future of Labour is being played out in Merseyside.Veteran Labour MP Frank Field who was the target of Militant in the Eighties, has sensationally been thrown out of the party he’s served all his life after resigning the whip in protest at the rise of the new extremists.But this time it’s not just Liverpool that’s being taken over by the hard Left but the Labour Party itself.And instead of Labour’s leader mounting a fightback for moderation, as Neil Kinnock did, the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn is the heart of the problem.Corbyn will be in Liverpool later this month for Labour’s own party conference — where the fate of the party may be decided.Will it cement victory for the new militants, now calling themselves Momentum, or be the moment that we get, in every sense, the opposition we need?I’ve known Frank for many years and he’s Labour to the core.He’s dedicated his life to fighting poverty. He has been a tough critic of my party and speaks with the moral authority of someone whose whole life has been given to serving the poorest.He pursued Philip Green over the collapse of BHS and got millions back for the company’s pensioners.But because Frank is an authentic spokesman for working people, including on issues like Brexit, he’s been targeted by the new militants who want everyone to follow Comrade Corbyn’s rigid party line.Frank is also heir to the Old Labour tradition of fighting racism and intolerance wherever it comes from. A war baby, he cherishes the role Labour played in defeating fascism. So when he takes such a stand against the party he loves, and does so citing the leader’s own complicity in anti-Semitism, then this is an alarm bell no-one can ignore.Other Merseyside MPs including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman have also spoken out against rising anti-Semitism and intolerance within Labour ranks and the abuse they have received is truly shocking.The question now must be, will others follow Frank?With not just local parties, but the leadership itself, implacably in the grip of the hard Left, can moderates stay, and thus lend cover and credibility to the current leader?Labour was the party, when Frank was a boy, which helped create the state of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people, which helped build Nato as a bulwark of Western values and which put the interests of working people first.Now that Labour’s leadership is criticised by our own Chief Rabbi for its attitude to Israel and the Jewish community, now that Labour has a leader who doesn’t believe in Nato and a strong defence, now that Labour is more interested in single-issue protest than building a better future for workers, can the majority of Labour’s MPs, who are decent, hard-working and moderate, really stay?Frank is right to shine a light on the issue of anti-Semitism. And not just because it is truly horrendous that, after the horrors unleashed in the 20th Century, this intolerance should return.But also because attitudes towards the Jewish community are the best indicator of how free and progressive a country is.Throughout history, the countries where Jewish people have felt safest, like the Netherlands and the UK, have been among the world’s freest.Countries where Jewish people have faced growing prejudice, like Germany and Russia during the last century, have been countries slipping into darkness.And as the Chief Rabbi has reminded us, what starts with prejudice against Jewish people spreads to taint society more widely.The Jewish community is the canary in the coal mine.And if our democracy is to stay strong then we need to have political parties that are broad-based social movements and not increasingly ideological sects.I am a Tory but I grew up to admire and respect the patriotic Labour tradition of people like Clement Attlee, Ernie Bevin, Jim Callaghan, Peter Shore, Barbara Castle and Frank Field.I wish him well and hope that his bravery will prove the wake-up call his party and the country needs to ensure there’s a sensible party of the centre left once more.NO more heroes any more, the Stranglers sang. Well, they reckoned without Lewis Pugh, a man whose grit, endurance, idealism and dedication make him the very model of a modern hero.Lewis is the endurance swimmer who powered his way into the record books this week by covering the length of the English Channel – from Land’s End to Dover – in 50 days.He covered the 330 miles – past the Eddystone Lighthouse, the Isle of Wight and Dungeness Power station – in just Speedos, cap and goggles.In stormy waters, sometimes swimming in the dead of night, through rain and high winds, with shoulder injuries, jellyfish stings and treacherous currents to slow him down, Lewis triumphed in a trial of character and cojones, which takes the breath away.But what drove Lewis on was not a desire to etch his name in the record books.It was a swelling passion for our seas, the wildlife in them and the future of our planet.In our own waters, and across the globe, the seas have suffered as a result of past exploitation, the growing danger from climate change, acidification and the rising tide of plastic waste.We have an opportunity to change that now.Leaving the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy means we can have a more sustainable approach to managing the fish in our seas.And reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, as well as improving recycling, can stem the flow of waste into our seas.But there is still more to do and making sure that more of the Earth’s surface is protected from exploitation is critical.Lewis records that during the length of his swim he encountered jellyfish in abundance, happy to bask in our warming waters, but far fewer fish, dolphins and other marine wildlife than he would have expected.As another modern hero, Sir David Attenborough, has reminded us, our Blue Planet is a precious but fragile place and we all have a responsibility to think about our impact on our seas.But the good news is that more and more people in Britain are cutting down on plastic, recycling more and helping nature recover, which is heroic in itself.The tech giant is planning to co-operate with China to censor material online.But it won’t respond to calls from the UK, US and others to co-operate in removing horrific images of abuse.The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil” but that was dropped earlier this year. Now we know why.I’M not surprised Prince Harry burst into song – albeit briefly – when he and wife Meghan met the cast of hit musical Hamilton.The hip-hop lyrics are infectiously catchy, so much so the Gove family often sing along to them in the car.And a musical about breaking free from an overbearing and distant overlord who doesn’t govern in your interests does have a special resonance for us.Happily, she accepted and will presumably now promise to forsake all udders.SAD to see the lovely Kirsty Young having to take a break from Desert Island Discs to battle fibromyalgia.This terrible condition – marked by chronic pain and extreme fatigue – has no ready cure.It can strike any of us down, casting a shadow over even the simplest pleasures.I hope Kirsty recovers soon ­– and I also hope that the light shone on this illness hastens progress towards a cure.Almost everything you need for a healthy, balanced diet can be sourced from British farms and fishermen.And you know it will have been caught or grown in a way that respects the environment.Instead of our diet going south, why not save on the food miles and help the planet by buying British?THE return of Strictly to our screens this autumn divides the Gove household. But not in the way you might think.My wife can’t stand the show and my daughter cringes at it – but my son and I are hooked.We’ve cheered on Ed Balls’ Gangnam Style and rooted for Susan Calman last year.This year I think Casualty actor Charles Venn and Paralympian Lauren Steadman could become popular favourites.But no, I won’t be harbouring dreams of joining in.

They trust our laws and our financial services, they admire our Armed Forces and they envy our universities.Actually, that’s not quite true: everywhere I go in the world, except right here in the UK.There are some who can’t or won’t see the natural advantages we have and the opportunities that exist for us. I get frustrated when some people purposefully choose to ignore good news such as last week when China opened up their market to UK dairy products.Britain can and should be confident and the world needs a confident Britain.A confident Britain can bang the drum for free trade across the world, as more and more countries look to pull up the drawbridge and turn away from the huge benefits that we have seen in poverty alleviation.A confident Britain can work with African countries to tackle extremism and instability which threatens millions of people across the world, including right here in the UK, as the Prime Minister promised to do this week.A confident Britain with an independent seat at the World Trade Organisation can be a leading voice for free trade and prosperity.A confident Britain is good for the world, and it’s good for us at home too. Why?Because free trade means we can sell more world-class British goods and services across the globe. That means safeguarding and creating jobs as well generating revenues for the Treasury to spend on our vital public services.That’s why I launched the Export Strategy last month: to turn the UK into a 21st Century exporting superpower.We need to work together to ­create a more confident Britain that can export to the world.To do that, we need to support business the length and breadth of the whole UK.Over 99 per cent of our businesses are small or medium-sized, and 96 per cent are micro-sized, employing fewer than nine people.That means many thousands of Sun on Sunday readers either own one or work for one.You are the lifeblood of our economy — it’s your entrepreneurship, risk-taking and innovation that drives the entire economy.It’s your wealth creation that provides the income we all depend on for our public services, from funding our NHS to paying our brave Armed Forces.It also means that you might not be exporting — yet — because more than 90 per cent of companies aren’t currently seizing the opportunities of exporting.That’s where we can help.Government doesn’t manufacture products and doesn’t provide services for exporting.But we can help create the right conditions by intervening where only government can.We have created a network of Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioners to lead the Government’s trade and investment promotion and policy in high-growth regions across the world.And I as International Trade Secretary can step in and speak to foreign ministers about overcoming a trade barrier — as I did last week, when I signed a deal in Beijing to enable the UK to export seed potatoes to China or help a UK company close a deal in an overseas market or seal a partnership with a foreign company.And to support British businesses — whether they produce farm products, or manufacture playgrounds, or provide legal services — we are also creating a network of Export Champions, people who run businesses that successfully export, to guide their peers and share their expertise.As I’ve often said before, in the next ten to 15 years, around 90 per cent of global economic growth is expected to be outside the EU.I truly believe that Brexit is an ­opportunity.The positive response and engagement we’ve seen from the EU negotiators to the Chequers proposals makes me believe that a good deal is now more likely.At Chequers the Government agreed its proposal for an economic partnership with the EU after the UK leaves on March 29, 2019.It confirmed that the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union and will seize new opportunities from trading with the rest of the world.That’s why the Prime Minister visited Africa, one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, this week.It’s why I visited China last week, and am visiting India later in the autumn, to ensure Britain can make the most of their breakneck growth.Booming countries across the globe are confident in Britain.They’re confident in our crucial role in supporting world prosperity, world security and world growth.If they have faith in us, we need to have more faith. Because a more confident Britain is a better Britain for the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want our politicians to get on with it.Mrs May has also claimed that she is going to start focusing on her domestic agenda.

As with most of her premiership, Mrs May mustered her best in an awkward situation.This approach helps explain why a poll shows that Tory voters believe she is the figure who can unite Britain, ahead of other leadership prospects.Meanwhile, Liam Fox writes on this page that Britain should be confident going forward as an independent nation.There might finally be light at the end of the Brexit tunnel.IT is shocking that schools are calling for pupils to bring in loo roll because of cuts.Others are cancelling lessons and closing early.

It will replace an out-of-date system currently used by local authorities and utility firms to share data on the countries’ 2.5 million roadworks.Planning for roadworks is also set to be better co-ordinated and prevent drivers getting caught up in knock-on roadworks. Aids including Google maps and Waze will have access to the information. Satnavs and smartphones are also likely to benefit from the changes allowing motorists to choose a new route.Roadworks cost the economy £4 billion as employees are late for work and deliveries are delayed. A typical motorist faces £1,168 in costs for sitting in queues wasting fuel and time, research from traffic experts Inrix found earlier this year.London had the longest hold-ups last year with motorists stuck in rush hour traffic for 74 hours every year.Roads Minister Jesse Norman said: “Roadworks can often be frustrating for motorists, especially when they cause hold-ups at busy times and delay journeys.“We want to reduce this disruption and delay, and Street Manager is just one of a number of actions we are taking so that local authorities and utility companies can better plan and manage their roadworks.“The data opened up by this new digital service should enable motorists to plan their journeys better, so they can avoid works and get to their destinations more easily.”Ministers are also today publishing new guidance on lane rental schemes including a new calculator for assessing costs and benefits.

But we owe it to children to do more. We must and I will.”In a strong hint of the ultimatum for tech firms coming today, Mr Javid adds: “I am also clear that all parts of society must play their part in this battle”.The Home Secretary also reveals the personal upset he has suffered since taking the job in April from detailed briefings on online child sex abuse.And he also revealed growth in horrific “abuse to order” services, where paedophiles direct abusers what to do to their victims over a two-way livestream.Mr Javid writes: “Invisible crime gangs are also now able to live stream these sick acts to online abusers for just over £10 – a quarter of what paedophiles were paying four years ago.“Abhorrent crimes where perverted offenders live stream the rape of innocent youngsters over a web cam – and are ordered to carry out gut-wrenching acts by their conspirators who are watching on a computer from the comfort of their own home.”He added: “They sicken me to the core. But I am also sickened by the sheer number of these vile abusers.“Horrifying cases like this leave an emotional scar on me as well.”Mr Javid will also offer more money today to the NCA and police forces fighting online child sex abuse.His ultimatum follows Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s searing attack on Google last week for refusing to cooperate with police forces to take down child abuse content.Children’s charity Barnardo’s last night welcomed Mr Javid’s new drive.Its chief executive Javed Khan said: “All children with access to the internet are potentially vulnerable to being groomed online and sexually or criminally exploited offline.“Of the victims of online grooming referred to Barnardo’s specialist support services, we know that nearly two thirds of them, some as young as 10, had also gone on to meet their attacker and were sexually exploited.”In a coordinated effort, the National Crime Agency also last night pleaded with tech companies to cooperate with police investigations more.Its officer in charge of child sexual abuse, Director Rob Jones, called on the California-based giants to be far more proactive on stopping sick material ever appearing on their platfroms.Mr Jones said: “The technology exists for industry to stop these images being shared.The monsters who commit these acts are beyond contempt.It’s staggering that there are 80,000 of them prowling the net — the equivalent of FOUR packed-out O2 arenas — and we must tackle these horrendous crimes with all the force Britain can muster.The police must be given the resources they need to find and pursue these twisted individuals.Social services and local council staff, who have in the past too happily looked away from systematic abuse in places like Rochdale and Rotherham, must be properly trained and report their suspicions accurately.But the tech companies who allow their platforms to be filled with depraved filth need to do more, too.Their deliberate ignorance is part of a pattern.Whether it’s far-right extremism, anti-Semitism or terrorist propaganda, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are all too happy to turn a blind eye.The web has turned into the Wild West, and the companies profiting from it refuse to play sheriff.If they continue to abandon their responsibilities, they can have no complaints if the Government steps in, sooner rather than later.The Home Secretary must act if the billionaires refuse to do so.Keeping our kids safe is all that matters.“Whilst some online platforms have taken important steps to improve safety, we are asking them to take it to the next step to innovate, to use their brightest minds, and to invest in preventing these online offences from happening in the first place.“That would significantly reduce the trauma to the victims whose images are shared, prevent other individuals from developing a sexual interest in children through accessing these images, and disrupt the methods used to access them.”National Police Chiefs Council lead for child protection Chief Constable Simon Bailey added: Only by working collaboratively with technology companies and law enforcement partners will we be able to minimise the risk posed to children online by predatory offenders.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s about a hundred from his email. And that means we’ve obviously been able to look very closely at how well-meaning those people are before we accept them.”Mr Banks himself was blocked by Tory chiefs from becoming a Tory party member two weeks ago.A row has exploded among pro and anti-Brexit Tory MPs on whether to welcome UKIP supporters back to the party.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox appeared to side with the Brexiteers yesterday by refusing to criticise Mr Banks.Dr Fox would only say: “I don’t comment on any one individual.“But people who believe that we believe are welcome in the Conservative Party.“If we get back people who voted UKIP before, who believe that having successfully delivered Brexit the Conservative Party is the best party to govern Britain they’re welcome in the Conservative Party.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He knows now.Last week, Field quit the Labour Party whip amid a barrage of “intolerance, nastiness and intimidation” from Corbyn outriders over his stand against anti-Semitism.Along with other moderate Labour MPs, he was battered by Twitter storms using the vilest language to wish him dead.Field bluntly accuses Jeremy Corbyn of racism and hints he is ready to force a by-election if kicked out of the Labour Party. Others facing deselection may follow suit.Leadership critics have endured relentless bullying and abuse, a trademark of the brutal machine which swept Jezza to power and intends to keep him there. As Frank Field himself now admits, Corbyn is going nowhere.The party might split but the ageing hippy “will lead Labour into the next election”. Corbyn’s sullen anti-Semitism triggered this revolt, but it is only a symptom of the sinister nature of hard-Left politics which brooks no criticism.Labour really is the Nasty Party. Jezza’s pro-Russian, anti-capitalist malcontents loathe everything the UK and other Western democracies stand for.They support some of the world’s most brutal tyrannies and catastrophic economies while railing against free speech and Press freedom.Corbyn sees no evil in these repressive forces and this week shelved an invitation from MI5 chiefs to show him the secret intelligence. On such evidence alone, it is fair to say Corbyn as PM would permanently damage this country, its freedoms and its prosperity.We knew all this when Ed Miliband threw open the party’s leadership to anyone with three quid to buy a vote. Thanks to his stunning act of stupidity, the “broad church” Labour Party of Clem Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Tony Blair is history.It lives on in name only, an empty husk colonised by Momentum parasites who once fought the party they now own. Corbyn didn’t even want the job, telling supporters: “You’d better make f***ing sure I don’t win.”When he surprised himself by storming to victory in 2015, shell-shocked Blairite MPs assumed they could get rid of him if he stepped too far out of line.They tried that in 2016 — turning Jezza into the unassailable champion of the loony Left and handing over the keys to the asylum. Theresa May bolted him in place with her botched General Election. No wonder the Glastonbury millennials cooed: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.”Have we learned from Frank Field’s mistake? Or do we believe, as he did, voters will never be silly enough to give Corbyn the keys to power? Well, look at the polls. They show nobody much rates Jezza, but Labour remains neck and neck with the Tories.Theresa May has yet to navigate her way to a tricky Brexit deal with Brussels — or to a no-deal rejected by Commons Remainers. She has rightly turned her face against a second referendum, a democratic abomination.But who knows who will be leader by then? Boris Johnson is circling, helped by a growing team of sponsors and supporters. Mrs May would do anything to stop BoJo. She is even seeking official advice on another snap election gamble. Good luck with that, Theresa. But Remainers should be careful what they wish for.Corbyn, a fervent fan of arch-Eurosceptic Tony Benn, loathes the EU as much as the angry Labour supporters who voted Leave. But he would conveniently bury that hatred for the time being if it meant riding a Remainer wave into Downing Street.Pro-Brussels campaigner Keir Starmer would emerge, not for the first time, as a “useful idiot”.The Purge will have just begun.At a media event before his referendum, the ex-oil analyst confidently bet the price would not crash below 50 a barrel. It did. He sent me my winnings but they apparently went astray.So he offered double-or-quits. The price stayed below 50 for yet another year – and is still only a bit higher today. My winnings, £60 in today’s money, allegedly went to a charity. I never saw any evidence of that either.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sometimes you feel like Alfie is in him.She added: He frowns and stretches like Alfie, he is just a double. When I had him, I wondered what if he does resemble Alfie, how will I feel.Its nice to be able to say his name and feel positive.Emotional dad Tom was brought close to tears as he added: Sometimes you feel Alfie is in him. Youll say Alfie and Tom will smile. We will always have two children, no matter what.Were happy for what we had, and what we have still got because we have two amazing children and we will always have them.Alfies parents went to “hell and back” battling to keep their tragic son alive after he was believed to have been suffering from a degenerative brain disease.Alfie’s parents, from Liverpool, launched a legal bid to keep him alive after doctors applied to turn off his life support.Tom even flew to Rome to see Pope Francis when doctors in Italy offered to treat Alfie.But despite receiving an outpouring of support from the community - dubbed “Alfie’s Army”- the familys pleas were denied.Alfies life support was switched off despite pleas at the High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court and European Court of Human Rights.Speaking today, dad Tom said the final days of his sons life were a waking nightmare, adding: You do everything you can for your kids like anyone else would at home. In the end it comes crashing down on you really.Kate added: Its the worst thing possible to go through. The first time I got told he was going to die it was like a physical feeling.I sort of knew it was going to come so I prepared myself for it, but you can’t prepare yourself. With the support I had round me we are holding it together.DECEMBER 2016: Alfie, seven months, is taken to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital after suffering seizures and goes into coma.DECEMBER 2017: Doctors say continued life-support treatment is not in the tot’s best interests.FEBRUARY 2018: High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden rules in hospital’s favour and says further treatment is futile.MARCH 2018: Parents Tom and Kate mount a challenge but decision is upheld.APRIL 2018: Supreme Court justices and the European Court of Human Rights reject a bid from Tom and Kate to consider Alfie’s case.APRIL 28: Alfie dies after life-support is switched off. His parents say: “We are heartbroken.”AUGUST 8: The couple’s second child, Thomas Evans, is born.Alfie died 100 hours later, with devastated Tom announcing on Facebook: “My gladiator lay down his shield and gained his wings.“Absolutely heartbroken. I love you my guy.”Pope Francis tweeted afterwards: “I am deeply moved by the death of little Alfie.I pray especially for his parents as God the Father receives him in his tender embrace.”The couple have since said they are pouring all their efforts into helping other sick children, no matter what condition they have.Both Kate and Tom carry a rare gene which sparked Alfie’s illness, so there were fears Thomas could inherit the same condition.A source said : “They have been left devastated by Alfie’s passing, but also vowed that they would carry on living for their son and are determined his death won’t break them.“It’s obviously tinged with sadness though as they know Alfie would have been a fantastic big brother, if only he’d managed to survive.”"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket caught sticking googly eyes on fish to make them look fresher","story":"Kuwaiti police shut down the fish store on Saturday, the Al Bayan newspaper reported after they shared hilarious images of the fresh fish.One of the pictures posted online showed the fake eye slipping off the fishs face, clearly revealing a much more yellow eye underneath.As a joke, a fish company in Kuwait announced it was selling fish without cosmetics, alongside a picture of a fish and a selection of different coloured contact lenses.Social media users quickly mocked the shop owners attempt to get away with selling old fish with a series of hilarious memes that went viral.Twitter users tweeted a series of memes making fun of the googly eyed fish.Mohammed El Dahshan tweeted: Kuwaiti police has shut down a fish store that was sticking googly eyes on fish to make them appear more fresh than they are. :- via Al Bayan newspaper which got over 117k likes and over 62.5k retweets.Ashley Feinberg, another verified user, quoted the above tweet saying my strongest-held belief is that extremely creative crimes that dont involve maiming another person should be allowed.Some Twitter users took advantage of the situation to be punny.MBlockU, a verified user, quoted at El Dahshans tweet: Well this certainly looks fishy.

Theres some potential for thunder and hail.Also on Friday that becomes a little bit more widespread with a chance across much of the country.Meanwhile the heat appears to be playing havoc with Britains flora.Stunning pictures show a virginia creeper which has turned red unusually early at a historic country manor.Sandy Stewart noticed the breathtaking flower — which is meant to turn red during mid-to-late Autumn — turned red a month early.Sandy, 85, who lives at Ardvorlich House, Perthshire, said: It goes up like ivy outside the front half of the house.It normally turns red during Autumn but this year it has turned red unusually early.It is really stunning to look at because of the wonderful colour and I would say it gives the house a lot of character.We are certainly all chuffed by it. I just wonder what could have caused it to turn red this early."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000430795988.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"baby survives five days wood south china","story":"The child, identified in Chinese media only as 20-month-old Yueqiao, is reported to have wandered to the mountainside on her own not far from her home in Chinas Guangxi Zhuang region.According to the articles - which The Sun Online was unable to verify - she was reported missing on 28th August after her father, Chen Qingran, realised she was gone the previous evening.The only breadwinner for a family of eight - including four kids and a bedridden wife - Chen had gone out to run errands and thought his youngest daughter was asleep inside.He said: I went into town for about 30 minutes and left her at home.

such as the possibility of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.They say the UK and Ireland should form their own free-trade and customs zone separate to the EU arrangements.And they also argue that Ireland will lose its traditional neutral stance in military matters as a result of being involved in the European army.Hermann Kelly, who works for Mr Farages Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy in Brussels, says casting off EU supervision will be similar to when Ireland gained independence from Britain.And he told the Irish Sun the EU had taken out €200billion worth of fish from Irish waters.Nearly all mainstream politicians in Ireland are passionately pro-EU and PM Leo Varadkar has encouraged Brussels to take a hard line in Brexit talks.But some voters want the country to prioritise its relationship with Britain over ties to to the continent."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000403684711.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"scotland could be persuaded to back independence from britain post brexit poll suggests","story":"The survey shows support for leaving the union would overtake the number who want to stay post-Brexit.The findings, which come from pro-EU group Best for Britain campaign, will be used by Remoaners to further claims the UK should not leave.But the poll will be dismissed as part of ‘Project Fear’ by Eurosceptics.The results showed that in Scotland, if Britain leaves the European Union 47 per cent of people would vote to make the country Independent, while just 43 per cent would vote for Scotland to remain in the UK.Whereas if Scotland stays in the EU 47 per cent of voters would vote against leaving Great Britain.Voters in Northern Ireland, which like Scotland voted majority for Remain in the 2016 referendum, were also polled – with 52 per cent saying they would vote for a united Ireland outside of the UK after Brexit.While just 39 per cent will favour the province staying part of the UK.However, if Brexit does not go ahead, only 35 per cent said they would support a united Ireland outside of the UK,.And  52 per cent would vote for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK.Commenting on the poll, Best for Britain chief Eloise Todd said: “When people voted in 2016, they didn’t vote to break up the union and risk both Scotland and Northern Ireland voting for a different future outside the United Kingdom.“This is compelling evidence as to why we need to stop and think again.“The public deserve a say on the final deal, with the knowledge that if Brexit happens we could shatter the union altogether.But Colin Clark, the Scottish Conservative MP who ousted Alex Salmond in Gordon in 2017, said: The people of Scotland voted by a significant margin to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014.The body of polling work since then does not suggest any meaningful change in that view.“It is time to focus on securing the best deal as we leave the EU - one that works for all parts of the UK.SNP MP Stephen Gethins said: As the deeply damaging consequences of a no deal Brexit become clearer, as Scotlands economy continues to outperform the UK and as people grow increasingly concerned about the future under Westminster rule, support for Scotlands ability to take its own decisions in an independent country will only grow further.Nicola Sturgeon reacted with amazement, tweeting: Wow -

She returned home and found a listening device in her bedroom.Joanne told the court: He played me a recording in my own house and told me he had paid someone to place a device on the outside of my house which I did not believe.I went to a spy shop in Leeds and asked them, if I wanted to bug someones house what do you do? He told me what to look for. She later found a second device hidden behind a TV in her bedroom and Bamford, of Gildersome, near Leeds, was arrested.Bamford admitted stalking causing serious alarm or distress but a trial of issue was held yesterday after the prosecution and defence could not agree on the basis of his guilty plea.He claimed to have fitted only one of the listening devices and said she had fitted the other to keep tabs on another ex.But the judge, Recorder Anthony Hawks, said: I find the complainant entirely plausible.I find the defendant evasive and dishonest. I totally reject his account that the complainant was responsible.Im very concerned about the risk you may present to people. You were prepared to engage in a highly sophisticated way to stalk that woman.It goes without saying there can be little more terrifying for somebody to find out they are being listened to in their own home, the one place entitled to feel safe.It seems to me that this is an inevitable prison sentence. I regard these offences extremely serious and highly sinister.Bamford, who was jailed for 30 months in November 2015 at Leeds Crown Court for money laundering and dealing cannabis, was bailed and will be sentenced on October 19.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She attended the first event in his home village of Medbourne, near Market Harborough, Leics, three months after Lees murder but he later stopped returning her calls.Rebecca told Leicester crown court: He said he wanted to raise thousands and thousands. He spoke about large money and it was as if he was going to set Jack up for life.But she added: Jack or myself never received a penny. I tried to contact him and it got to the stage where there were no returned calls, no answers, no emails. I couldnt say how many times I tried. It was a fair few.“Gary invited us to Medbourne to the truck-pull event. I paid for my expenses - hotels and meals. It was so busy - there must have been hundreds maybe thousands of people. I thought the money was for Jack and a portion was for local charities. I have not received any money from the truck-pull event.“He told me he wanted to dedicate a song to Lee to raise more funds for Jack. He never told me how he would get the money to produce the single. I wouldn’t have allowed it if I knew the money was coming from the truck-pull event. I have not received any money from the charity single.“I contacted him about the money not long after the single was launched. I contacted him by phone, message and email. I tried a fair few times to contact him. We had conversations about the money in the past and he just said it would be as much as thousands - as if it was going to set Jack up for life.”Rebecca also said that if shed known Gardner was spending the cash on producing a charity single she wouldnt have allowed it.Prosecutor Samuel Skinner said it was not known exactly how much Gardner raised from the 2013 truck-pull and two similar events in 2015 because he kept no records. But analysis of bank statements suggests it was at least £24,000.Mr Skinner said: He used donors money to finance a charity music single without the permission of the donors because he wanted to become a music promoter. In any event, the defendant used some of the money for a purpose that the original donors never intended and would not have approved if they had known.It appears that the defendant has spent all the money he received. He has not given Jack Rigby, or his trust fund, any money. The defendant has said the cost of running the charity events limited the amount available for donation.However, the defendant appears to have an enthusiasm for promoting ‘emerging music artists’, and it is the showcasing of these artists to the public with himself as the manager or producer that has swallowed up most of the verifiable donations.”In February 2014, Gardner launched the charity single Miss You Machine in Trafalgar Square and enlisted retired soldiers from Lees Royal Fusiliers regiment to collect donations.Mr Skinner said: They wore their beret and hackle and thought they were representing their old regiment. We have no idea what he did with this money, or how much it came to. Jack Rigby has not seen any of it.”The jury heard that Gardner, who denies three counts of fraud, became very aggressive when he was quizzed about the cash by fellow organisers of the truck-pull event. Karl Jenkins, a member of the Medbourne Village Hall Committee, said: The whole process of asking questions and trying to get answers out of him was just impossible.Everywhere you drove in the area there was a poster for this truck-pull. We could not do anything but let it go ahead. I wasnt satisfied at all. In fact I was very uncomfortable about the whole situation. I was sickened to the stomach because I had no idea how much had been raised or where it had gone.After the first event Gardner publicly showed a giant charity cheque made out to the Jack Rigby trust for £3,000 but no cash was handed over, the court heard. It was claimed that villagers offered to help count the cash but he refused.Lee was killed by Islamic extremists Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. Adebolajo was given a whole-life term and Adebowale was jailed for a minimum of 45 years.The trial continues.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She says we can leave in a safe and orderly manner through the Chequers plan or we can leave dangerously and chaotically if we don’t agree a departure deal with Europe.In truth, there are other choices. We could surrender less sovereignty by proposing a conventional trade agreement, as Davis suggested in a white paper that was rejected by the PM.But his proposal was never published, and Davis is now on the backbenches.We could join the European Economic Area, like Norway, leaving us subject to European laws, including free movement, and paying into the Brussels budget.Advocates, including the Tory MP Nick Boles, say this would buy us time to sort out our long-term relationship with Europe, but we would risk getting stuck half-in, half-out of the EU for years.Whatever the merits of his case, however, Boles is a backbench MP who cannot impose policy on the Government.Because Theresa May is the Prime Minister, Chequers is the only policy on the table. But Chequers, as bad as it already is, will not be the final deal.Downing Street insiders insist it is “obtainable” without further compromises, while the PM says she will not accept compromises “that are not in our national interest”. But this is the problem: There will be further compromises, which come on top of an already flawed proposal.And this is hardly a surprise, because Chequers is unacceptable to the Europeans.The EU’s number one rule is that the “four freedoms” of its single market — in goods, services, people and capital — cannot be divided.And yet Chequers — as unacceptable as it is to British Eurosceptics — seeks to divide these four freedoms.Britain is effectively asking to stay in the single market for trade in goods but not in services, people and capital.If we want what we have proposed for goods, the Europeans will say we must accept the other obligations.As part of an agreement about services, they will insist on Britain accepting more EU laws and a greater role for the European Court.They are likely to demand financial contributions and access to British waters for their fishing industry.And while they might not call it free movement, they will insist on concessions that grant Europeans almost automatic access to the British labour market.This prediction is not plucked out of thin air. It is based on decades of EU policymaking, and everything European leaders and their negotiators have said since the referendum.It is reflected in the EU’s own negotiating guidelines, issued to the European Commission by the Council of Ministers.And it is why, in her Lancaster House speech last year, Theresa May ruled out single market membership.Having to accept its obligations, she said, “would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all”.And yet this is the danger we now face. According to several Government sources, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is “itching” to make a “generous offer” on immigration. Some believe he wants to retain free movement rules, because he says we cannot get a good trade deal unless we do so.Theresa May, on the other hand, is adamant that free movement must end.But whether or not we are legally part of EU free movement rules, the question is whether her deal will regain full control of immigration to Britain. And what we know already is alarming.There is nothing wrong with allowing tourists to come here easily, students to attend British universities and business people to travel without bureaucracy.Nor is there a problem with firms moving their workers across borders quickly and easily to provide services.And it makes sense to give Europeans preferential access to Britain compared to people from further away.But few ministers care about reducing immigration, and the Chequers white paper is remarkably open about the options. It proposes, for example, a “youth mobility scheme” that would give young Europeans the right to live and work in Britain for fixed periods.Without strict limits, this alone could destroy meaningful immigration control, because most people who want to migrate are young.Around 64 per cent of EU migrants to Britain are under 30, while 86 per cent are younger than 40.The white paper suggests “other specific mobility areas”, without giving further details. It proposes “social security coordination” which might allow migrants to claim benefits for children living back home in countries like Poland.And it says nothing about our ability to deport or bar European criminals from Britain.Most worryingly, there is no proposal for a visa system for European workers.Without that, unskilled and low-skilled immigration will continue without limit.It does not need to be like this.We are discussing these unacceptable compromises because Chequers proposes partial membership of the EU’s single market.If we want to escape Europe’s laws, its court and its demands for our money — and if we want to control immigration — the Government needs to revive its plans for a free trade agreement, and it needs to do so urgently.Unless it does, Brexit will not mean Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Good. Then let’s proceed, in an open-minded fashion, with X Factor, the focus group years, where there are some new faces on the panel.We’ve got Louis “lad” Tomlinson, who brings the experience of taking part in the show.Robbie Williams, who brings the ­experience of over 20 years in the music industry.And Ayda, who brings the ­experience of playing Angela Moroni in Days Of Our Lives.Ironically, though, the newest face of all probably belongs to Simon Cowell, whose head now requires constant fanning and is so curiously swollen they could shove it on a plinth in the FA Museum above a plaque that reads: “1923 Cup Final ­football.”What caused it to balloon, I cannot say for sure, but if it was done to divert attention from the other end of the judging panel, he’s seriously underestimated the attention-seeking and self-absorption of Robbie Williams, which is total.A factor not helped by the adoring presence of Ayda, whose public displays of affection for “Rob” could quickly become the X Factor’s most nauseating ever detail.Enormous as it is, there’s not much Simon’s head can do about the singing either.The problem here, of course, is that almost everyone who wants to audition for a karaoke show has now auditioned, or sung professionally.So we were swamped with re-treads on this weekend’s double-header.Among them were: Danny Tetley, who appeared on Pop Idol, Caribbean ­talent show ­veteran Olatunji Yearwood, who’s already got a record deal, Livin’ Joy’s Janice “Dreamer” Robinson, and Brendan ­Murray from Hometown, a Sony act who were managed by Louis Walsh. Not that anyone was admitting as much.If there was any joy and spontaneity to proceedings, though, it was generally ­provided by those random whack-nut contestants who don’t appear on Simon’s approved list.Acts like Livia and the Elementals, Aaron Denham, who looked like he’d absconded from Guantanamo Bay, and Andy Hofton, who performed a song called Castle Of Love that’s been 20 years in gestation and, to no tune at all, went like this.“All my life, I’ve been building a castle of love. That lifts me to your heart.“Here I am, I’ve built my castle of . . .”“Andy! ANDY!” Simon’s hand of objection went up. He was then asked if he had a second song. Angels kicked in and I think you know what happened next.If someone on the judging panel had their wits about them, obviously, they’d have waited for Andy and Robbie to finish their duet then said: “Actually, let’s try Castle Of Love again.”No chance of that, though, as Cowell set his stall out, day one, when he told Danny Tetley: “The music business should be more open-minded.”The irony of a show that’s spent 14 series steering viewers towards its preferred winner now demanding open-mindedness won’t be lost on anyone, but I think it’s just ­cosmetic.The sort of “let’s-pretend we’re-nice” ­cobblers political parties trot out when they’re in as much trouble as this show.It won’t work, though. ’Cos there were so many things the X Factor urgently needed to ditch — sob stories, manipulation, product-placement, deception, scripted “spontaneity” — yet it sounds like the only element it’s going to discard is the brutal and funny honesty which made it stand out from the competition.Show’s over, folks.Paul Merson: “The one person I feel sorry for is the Newcastle fans.”And Tony Cottee: “Hemed’s had two efforts, Freeman’s had two efforts and all three have been saved.”CELEBRITY Big Brother viewers finally got to see last week why the show paid £75,000 to book actress Roxanne Pallett, whose relationship with the truth could, at best, be described as flexible.Unwitting victim was Corrie’s Ryan Thomas, who engaged her with a spot of the house craze for shadow boxing on Thursday’s show, which everyone could see was entirely playful.Having initially laughed it off, though, Roxanne suddenly decided it was “an assault” and he was “a woman beater”, who had to be removed.It made a mockery of the real thing, obviously, and would have ruined Ryan’s life if there’d been a hint of doubt about the video footage.In the kangaroo court atmosphere of the #MeToo movement, however, and with a £75,000 investment to protect, Channel 5 had to indulge her fantasies and give Ryan an official warning for his “behaviour”.She’s since fled the house, of course, without her fee, and apologised.If anyone’s missing Roxanne’s histrionics, though, there’ll soon be another chance to see the dingbat lose her s**t on Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where her stay comes to a tearful climax over the camp fire which, apparently, sparks fevered memories of a teenage house inferno that could’ve killed her entire family. But didn’t.It’s a pattern likely to continue as well.Given the fact then that reality television clearly causes Roxanne Pallett such huge emotional distress and painful memory spasms, it’s probably best if neither she nor the toxic show that booked her ever troubles us again.BBC2’s Eight Go Rallying, in ­CambodiaBBC1’s Bodyguard is a curse, a liability, a Jonah. Norman bloody Wisdom in a bullet-proof vest.He sits on a train, ­suicide bombers appear in the next carriage.He gets in a car with the Home Secretary, a sniper’s killed Terry the driver.He turns up to see her speak? KABOOM! The front three rows of the ­theatre suddenly explode.Where Sergeant David Budd goes, trouble ­immediately follows.And still no one at MI5 or Scotland Yard has made the connection.Mind you, it took the best brains at the Met several days to work out the sniper, who had a shot on him like Yul Brynner in The Magnificent Seven, “might be ex-Forces”.Yeah, well, it’s not a bad theory, I suppose, though you couldn’t rule out the possibility they’ll haul in David Blunkett for questioning next week, as this lot all seem to have trained with Walford CID, the world’s stupidest police force.It’s just one of several reasons why I’m still not buying into Bodyguard.The others being, its idiotic levels of political correctness, the stilted performance of Richard Madden as Budd, and his entirelyunbelievable relationship with Keeley Hawes’ Julia Montague.Mind you, she did conjure up an even more far-fetched and disturbing possibility on Sunday night when she told him: “Sex with the Home Secretary, it’s a heinous crime.”Sex with the Shadow Home Secretary.

The study shows that since the 2016 referendum 1.6million people who backed Leave have moved to the Remain camp. The vast majority of these - 1.4million - are Labour supporters especially in the north east and north west of England. But this is offset by a hardening of attitudes among Tory voters, with 800,000 Conservatives who backed Remain now saying they would vote Leave. The findings are based on an analysis of YouGov polls of 15,000 people by the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign and Hope Not Hate.  It finds a major shift in views among Labour voters in the party’s traditional heartlands with seats such as Wigan, Middlesbrough, Barnsley Central and Bolton South East moving towards Remain. In Burnley 33% backed Remain at the referendum but 45% would now do so, while in Barnsley Central 31% voted Remain but that has leapt to 49% and in Middlesbrough the number backing Remain has gone from 34% 47%. It is a similar story in Washington \u0026amp Sunderland West where support for Remain has risen from 38% to 49% and Ashton-under-Lyne where it has risen from 38% to 47.6%.  Best for Britain says since the 2016 referendum 112 parliamentary seats that voted Leave would now back remain, with the majority of them  held by Labour. According to its analysis a further 71 further seats that are likely to switch to Remain in the near future. Labour MP Owen Smith said the findings showed why Jeremy Corbyn should back a second referendum. He said: “This new data confirms that Britain is changing its mind about Brexit and Labour voters are leading the change.  “They want to see an end to austerity and they are worried that Brexit will mean years more of cuts to the NHS and other public services. “If Jeremy Corbyn wants to be Prime Minister and to rebuild those public services he needs to win those voters by delivering a vote on the final deal and a chance for the country change course on Brexit.” So far the Labour leadership has refused to endorse a referendum on the final Brexit deal but has said the option remains on the table. According to the survey, 56% of Labour voters wanted a second poll, with 32% opposed. The poll also found middle aged voters are most likely to have changed their mind on Brexit, with 32% of 25 to 34 year-olds moving from Leave to Remain and 23.7% of 35 to 44 year-olds. By contrast only 2.8 of those aged 65 and over have altered their opinion on Brexit. The findings also spell potential trouble for Tory Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab. In Mr Johnson’s Uxbridge constituency in London only 14% backed a no deal Brexit with 49% opposed and 74% said they did not know how complicated Brexit would be. In Mr Raab’s Esher and Walton seat 58% back Remain, with 73% saying Brexit gets in the way of the real issues facing the country.

Kate James, 20, gave birth to Thomas four weeks ago, just over three months after losing a bitter court battle to keep 23-month-old Alfie alive. And she says the new arrival looks exactly like her beloved firstborn. Cradling the sleeping infant yesterday, she said: “He’s amazing, he’s the absolute double of Alfie. “When I wake up to feed him in the morning and he does that stretch, sometimes I feel Alfie is in him.”  The mum suffered sleepless nights in the days after Thomas was born, fearing he could have the same degenerative brain disease that killed his brother. Doctors warned her and her boyfriend Tom Evans that there was a 25% chance he might suffer the same condition, which was not definitively diagnosed until after Alfie’s death on April 28. Now it has been identified as GABA-transaminase deficiency, a disorder so rare it has been diagnosed only 10 times – but any child of Kate and Tom’s has a high chance of being born with it. Kate said: “They explained to us that they had found two faulty genes. One comes from me and one comes from Tom. “Only 10 children in the world have had [the \u0026shycondition]. Five have passed, five are still alive. “Me and Tom have a one-in-four chance of it happening to more babies. I knew there was a chance that Thomas could have it.”  After his birth last month, the couple from Liverpool suffered an agonising four days as doctors conducted a series of tests. Kate told ITV’s This Morning yesterday: “We couldn’t sleep. When I had him, that’s when it kicked in. Everything he would do, I was like: ‘Oh my God, he’s got it, he’s got it’.” Tom added: “They were the most nerve-racking days.” But finally the couple were given the good news that Thomas was in the clear. It means they can finally sleep peacefully after a traumatic two years dominated by their fight for Alfie’s life. In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mirror earlier this year, Kate had told of the pain she felt when doctors said nothing could be done to save Alfie. She said: “You can feel it all over. Your body aches, it comes from all over.” Kate said Alfie was the “best thing in the world” to happen to the couple when he was born in May 2016. “Alfie was a shock because we weren’t trying for a baby,” she said. “He was absolutely gorgeous, he was a dream – the perfect baby. He had the funniest laugh. Tummy giggles right from the get-go. He was just a loving boy, he was so content.”  But the couple started having concerns about him when they noticed he was not progressing as normal. Kate said: “He wasn’t reaching his milestones – sitting up, hand-eye \u0026shyco-ordination. He wasn’t babbling much and his swallowing reflex wasn’t good. At the age of seven months he was still on puree, like three-month baby food. Kate took him to her GP three times but was told there was little to worry about. But she knew things were not right and asked her health visitor to speak to the doctor. In November 2016 medics agreed to see Alfie and he had an MRI scan. Weeks later he fell seriously ill and was rushed to Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool, where he stayed until his death over a year later.  Doctors at the hospital said there was nothing more they could do and it was in his best interests to let him slip away. They won a court’s permission to withdraw his life support, prompting Tom and Kate to begin their long and heartbreaking battle to overturn the decision. The couple appealed to judges both in the UK and Europe to help them, and Tom even travelled to the Vatican to enlist the support of the Pope. But it was all to no avail and Alfie’s life support was switched off and he died five days later. The couple are now launching a charity in Alfie’s name to support other sick children like him. During the legal proceedings Kate discovered she was carrying their second child. And she admitted yesterday that her initial reaction to her new pregnancy was “bitter sweet”.

Gary Gardner invited the murdered soldier’s widow Rebecca and son Jack to be guests of honour at truck-pull fundraisers. He allegedly vowed to raise enough to set Jack “up for life” with high-profile events, including one at which ex-Fusiliers went round with tins collecting from crowds. A jury heard he did raise at least \u0026pound24,000 – but that none was ever given to Jack or his trust fund.  Instead, prosecutors claimed, Gardner spent cash on a music single in a bid to be a top producer, paid off his overdraft and blew more on expenses. Samuel Skinner, prosecuting, told Leicester crown court: “The defendant declared publicly that he donated \u0026pound3,000 to Jack Rigby. That was untrue.” Rebecca, 34, told jurors that neither she nor Jack, now eight, “ever received a penny” from Gardner and that he finally stopped answering calls or emails.

Emma Standish’s organs are failing due to damage caused by immunosuppressants taken to stop the body attacking the donor heart. The 27-year-old said apart from her kidneys she is in good health. “My heart is fabulous – they found the perfect heart,” she said. “People are shocked when they find out about my transplant as I’m just a normal girl.” Emma, from Bolton, was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, which is believed to be triggered by an infection, at the age of nine. She became poorly over a year as her heart muscle stretched and it could not beat properly.  She had been given just 72 hours to live when she was rushed 150 miles from the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital to Newcastle Freeman Hospital to be fitted with a mechanical heart. But word came through on the journey that a suitable donor had been found. Since surgery she has lived a normal life and had children – Ava, seven, and Harrison, three – with partner Wayne. She said: “I think my parents didn’t tell me much about what was going on to protect me because I was still so young. “The doctors told my parents that if I didn’t get a heart transplant I was going to die. I had no idea what was going to happen and I was so poorly I just wanted to give up fighting.” Emma, who works at Royal Bolton Hospital, supports our Change the Law for Life campaign calling for organ donation to be opt-out unless relatives object.

The move was unveiled by lottery operator Camelot, but is dependent on government approval. Cash totalling \u0027thousands of pounds\u0027, will be paid every month to winners for at least 25 years, Lottery bosses say. They believe offering players long-term financial security rather than a one-off, huge jackpot, will appeal to a new audience. It is part of a string of measures introduced amid falling ticket sales.  In a statement, Camelot said: Subject to regulatory approval, Camelot will launch a brand new annuity game in the spring of 2019, which is expected to have a top prize of thousands of pounds every month for at least 25 years. It said it has carried out research in countries where similar games are played. The statement continued: Subject to approval from its regulator, Camelot is currently finalising details for a brand new annuity game, which is expected to launch in the spring of 2019 and which will offer a regular, fixed amount of money for a set number of years.  As part of its extensive research, Camelot has been closely examining what is done in other countries where this type of game is hugely popular. Annuity games appeal to people who dream of lifelong financial security, rather than just big, one-off jackpots – so this will be an entirely new proposition to round off The National Lottery portfolio.  It said the exact prizes and the cost of a ticket have yet to be decided. The statement continued: As the game isn’t due to launch until next year, the prizes on offer or the cost of play have not yet been finalised – but the early indication is that the top prize will be thousands of pounds every month for at least 25 years. Camelot will provide an update as soon as possible – and in line with the normal processes in the lead-up to the launch of a new game. Overhauls of Lotto and Euromillions will also aim to create more millionaires. From November, the Millionaire Raffle will be scrapped and instead \u0026pound1million will be handed to players who match five winning numbers and the bonus ball. Until now this combination – with a one in seven million chance – has only scooped \u0026pound50,000. Winnings also rise from \u0026pound1,000 to \u0026pound1,750 for five numbers, while four get \u0026pound140 instead of \u0026pound100.

A devastating photo of Jake Schofield has been shared showing his bruised and blood-splattered face in a bid to track down his attackers. The call centre worker, 21, had been enjoying a night out in Manchester with older brother Nathan. But things took a nasty turn when he was repeatedly kicked in the head by two men during the vicious attack in the early hours of Sunday.  Jake and Nathan were walking home with a mate when they saw two men relieving themselves, the Manchester Evening News reports.  But when Nathan, 27, asked them to stop, the men, thought to be in their 40s, began attacking them, Nathan was kicked to the floor, while their friend suffered a broken nose after he was punched in the face.  The men, who were also accompanied by a male in his late teens or early 20s, then turned their attentions to Jake. He was punched to the floor and kicked unconscious in a terrifying assault. As Jake lay in a pool of blood just yards from his home in Turf Lane, Chadderton, the men then got in a car driven by a woman and fled the scene. Luckily a neighbour heard the commotion, saw Jake on the floor and called 999. Police and paramedics were on the scene within minutes and Jake was taken to Salford Royal Hospital where was found to have suffered a fractured skull, cheekbone, nose and hand. Jake’s sister Zoe, 25, said her brother, who had been on a night out in Manchester and had been dropped off by a taxi at the end of the street, is lucky to be alive.

The momentous General Strike of May 1926 shook the country to its core as trade unions tasted power over nine fraught days before \u0026shyspectacularly collapsing amid brutal \u0026shyaccusations of bitter betrayal. Buses and trains had been halted. Ships were left unloaded in docks. Power blackouts shut factories. Steel mills fell silent. And Fleet Street presses ceased running. Strikers clashed with soldiers, police, special constables and Hooray Henry scabs – officially labelled “volunteers” - recruited by an uncompromising Government to resume public transport and move food supplies.  The Flying Scotsman was derailed by saboteurs in Northumberland and there was a hint of class war, one strike \u0026shysympathiser spotting toffs in Eton ties doing jobs of porters they’d otherwise ignore at London’s Waterloo station. Britain had seen nothing like this. Before or since. Up to two million workers taking industrial action in support of a million coal miners locked out by greedy pit owners was a \u0026shymagnificent demonstration of unity.  Until, that is, the TUC leadership suddenly and spectacularly surrendered to PM Stanley Baldwin.  He proved vindictive in victory, \u0026shyunforgiven to this day for the misery inflicted by self-defeating vicious austerity – echoed in cuts since 2010 – to the welfare state and public services.  Labour MP Dennis Skinner’s dad Edward was a Derbyshire miner during the strike. His son, who spent 22 years down the pit before Bolsover elected him to Parliament, was born six years after a seismic dispute that cast its shadow over his family. “Dad was blacklisted for his role in the strike, branded a \u0026shytroublemaker by bosses who wouldn’t let him do his job,” Skinner once told me, the injustice still burning fiercely nine decades later. “Word was sent around the pits in the area not to employ him and he wasn’t allowed to go back down and earn a wage packet until they needed energy to rearm against Hitler and they couldn’t discriminate against him any longer. “He was a union man and like every miner and striker, he was a grafter who wanted to be paid and treated properly but owners wanted to exploit them and grind them down.”  The strike started one minute to midnight on May 3 before ending on May 12. It was a reaction to pit owners insisting miners work longer for less. Under the slogan “Not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day” the Miners’ Federation of Great Britain led by Arthur J Cook – the Arthur Scargill of his day – fought off an onslaught the year before by \u0026shythreatening strikes in a Triple Alliance with rail and transport unions. Baldwin temporarily subsidised mine owners and set up an \u0026shyOrganisation for the Maintenance of Supplies to take on the workers. The General Strike was \u0026shytriggered soon after the million colliers were shut out of pits for rejecting a 13% cut in breadline rates and an extra hour on the day. A boom after the Great War faded and the economy was battered by Winston Churchill, a union-basher and incompetent \u0026shyChancellor who made it expensive to export coal and other goods by \u0026shyshackling sterling to the price of gold.  TUC leaders nervous of calling the strike opposed by Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald were bounced into action by an army of workers rallying to the miners’ cause. Coalfield poverty was a life-ruining blight. Even King George V said: “Try living on their wages before you judge them.” Baldwin portrayed the mass \u0026shywalkouts as a revolutionary plot in an era when the Russian Revolution haunted the British Establishment Churchill set himself up as editor of the British Gazette, which was stuffed with lies. The TUC newspaper, British Worker, countered: “We are not making war on the people.” The \u0026shyfledgling BBC failed its first \u0026shyindependence test and became a propaganda arm of the Government.  Founding father John, later Lord, Reith cleared “news” reports with government censors and gave a \u0026shyplatform only to strike critics. Jumpy TUC leaders pulled the plug on the General Strike instead of \u0026shyescalating it, reflecting their own \u0026shyqualified commitment from the start. The miners were left to battle on alone until November when they were starved back without concessions, a defeated union divided with members already working in Nottingham a \u0026shyforetaste of the 1984-85 split. Yorkshire miner’s son Harry Leslie Smith was three at the time and is one of a few living threads to the strike. The Barnsley-born 95-year-old campaigner said: “During the strike we were skint, hungry and desperate and one day my dad took me to the pickets outside the pit where he had slaved all his adult life. Afterwards, when the Depression had broken our family and my dad was swept beneath the waves of poverty, I asked my mum why my dad took me that day to the picket line.  “She said it was so I would always remember that the spirit of a miner can never be broken by the lash of the owners.” Baldwin took his revenge with a 1927 Trades Disputes Act banning sympathy strike action. The law was repealed in 1946 then reintroduced by Margaret Thatcher in the 80s. It is still in place. Labour won the 1929 \u0026shyelection to form a minority government. Historian and former pitman David Douglass said: “The miners were left alone to fight it out in the most bitter of conditions and starvation, finally surrendering in November. They were then hit by a wave of closures, victimisations and harsh treatment.

The UK’s changeable summer climes have caused tensions to rise in the workforce, with 42 per cent of office workers admitting they have fallen out with a colleague over the air conditioning. Of those, 41 per cent were left griping because they felt conditions were too cold, while 36 per cent were left sweating it out, waiting for some relief from the heat. And four in 10 work with a colleague who is always chilly, even when the office is stifling for everyone else. Researchers also found the temperature of the average office is usually a warm 21 degrees, but workers would prefer the cooler climes of an office conditioned to 18 degrees. And two thirds wish their employer would do something to permanently improve the temperature in the office.  A spokesperson for Andrews Sykes, the UK\u0027s leading specialist air conditioning hire company, said: “Keeping the peace at work can be a delicate balance, and sometimes something as little as a few degrees either way in the temperature of the room can cause tempers to boil. “Summer 2018 has been one of the hottest on record, and for those cooped up indoors at work these soaring temperatures have made it a bit of a slog. “While the brunt of summer is now likely behind us, the weather forecast still shows sunshine to come, so keep a cool head in the office and head out for your Vitamin D when you can.” Earlier this summer, Andrews Sykes brought the sun indoors at one lucky office, by creating the \u0027Office Beach\u0027. The summery set-up came complete with sand, cocktails and games, bringing a taste of a beach break away to an otherwise-drab office environment.  The study of 2,000 office workers found 31 per cent have been guilty of coming up with an excuse to get out of the building and catch some extra rays on a workday when it is sunny out. A third of those have pulled a sickie, and one in ten have said a relative was unwell and they couldn’t make it in. More than half admit to feeling glum being stuck indoors during the heatwave with a third feeling trapped inside. One in four would rather be out making the most of the weather rather than stuck inside in front of a computer.

Anthony Brown says clean living just didn\u0027t work for him so ditched the healthy food for smaller portions of his favourite junk foods. The 34-year-old, who had been overweight for years, decided to weigh himself after a family health scare. He was shocked when the scales - which had a maximum weight at 26st 11lbs - just displayed an error message. That meant the 34-year-old from Riverside, California, had a weight too large to be registered by the equipment. But after a month of eating oatmeal, grilled chicken and vegetables, he ditched the healthy way of life and decided smaller portions of fast food and snacks made for a better tactic. Eating 2,000 calories a day of some of his favourites and spending no more than one hour a day in the gym, the 6ft5 dad-of-one says he got down to 13st, 12lbs in two years.

The method has helped several people lose fat, including Nick who dropped 6st, 6lbs in nine months and a mum named Monica who got rid of one stone, 8lbs two months after her pregnancy. Anthony said: “I hadn’t weighed myself in years. My friend had a scale that went up to 375 pounds and I thought that would definitely work for me, but it just said ‘error.’  After starting his new diet he said: My weight was dropping every week and I was still able to eat so many delicious meals. It was amazing. “Some people need 2,000 calories to maintain their weight, but since I weighed so much, eating 2,000 calories meant losing two pounds a week. “I basically started working out to make sure I wouldn’t get stuck with excess skin. I didn’t spend much time in the gym though and I still don’t. It’s just not the type of person I am.

The retail giant has decided to ban all internal email traffic between 6pm in the evening and 7am the following day. It says this will help staff \u0027clear their minds\u0027 and enjoy their time off. The measure has been introduced for Lidl workers in Belgium. Lidl spokeswoman Isabelle Colbrandt said: This way we give our employees the chance to clear their minds completely.  Ms Colbrandt said Lidl Belgium was taking the measure as some employees felt obliged to be reachable around the clock so they could give an instant reply if needed. Any internal emails which are sent after 6pm will be automatically put on hold and will now only be delivered into employees\u0027 inboxes the following day. Emails that are sent during the weekend will only arrive on Monday.  Ms Colbrandt said: We introduced this break for our internal email traffic to respect the private time of our employees even more and to promote a good work-life balance. Those who want can still send emails, but will not put any unknowing pressure on others to deal with work out of office hours.

With medics saying she was at risk of a fourth miscarriage, she was advised to abort two of the four in order to give the others a chance. But she decided to ignore doctors\u0027 advice, given when she was 17 weeks pregnant. Now the 35-year-old has spoken of her delight after her four healthy children are about to start school. After three years of struggling with infertility, Grace and her husband, James, 37, were dumbfounded when they discovered they\u0027d naturally conceived quads.  Grace managed to carry the quads until she was 32 weeks pregnant and Amelia, Lily-Grace, Mollie and Lucas were all born weighing between 2lbs and 4lbs. And despite Amelia being born with her organs in the wrong place, she is now as healthy as the other three.  The inseparable quads now can\u0027t wait to start pre-school and are finally set with their matching uniforms. Grace, from County Limerick, Ireland, said: I couldn\u0027t be more proud of the quadruplets and seeing them in their school uniforms is amazing. When I fell pregnant naturally with quadruplets I couldn\u0027t believe it as we had struggled for three years and I\u0027d suffered four miscarriages.  We couldn\u0027t afford IVF and when tests showed nothing was wrong I was baffled as to why we couldn\u0027t have children. I was over the moon when the quadruplets were born in May 2014, and despite being offered to abort two of them before they were even born as they were classed as high risk, we decided to let fate decide. They are definitely little miracles and we still can\u0027t believe we got four babies all at once. All of them love school and as they wear a uniform now it makes it a lot easier as trying to think of four outfits for them every day takes a long time.  They are going to be in the same classes at school and they are inseparable when together. It\u0027s so cute seeing them with their matching lunch boxes, shoes and backpacks. Grace has decided to buy 10 school uniforms to ensure Amelia, Lily-Grace, Mollie and Lucas have enough to last them each week. She added: Their uniforms are comfy and there\u0027s no getting them out of them once they\u0027re on, they love wearing sunglasses too which is adorable. Life is hectic with quadruplets but we wouldn\u0027t change it for the world even though it had made us realise that our family is now complete.

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed. The shops at the Victorian Market shut at 5pm. Staying open later and having maybe street entertainers there in the evening could attract more people.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 12:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04106000/04106341.jpg","title":"Dont miss chance to nominate a hero","story":"TIME is running out to nominate someone you know to be one of this year\u0027s Highland Heroes.The awards, organised by SPP Media and now in their second year, celebrate people in the Highlands who make a real difference to our communities, healthcare, education, safety and wellbeing.Readers are being invited to nominate people in any of the 12 categories: primary pupil, secondary pupil, primary teacher, secondary teacher, carer, fundraiser, volunteer, community champion, brave child, health professional, emergency services or armed forces hero and public servant.The deadline for nominations is midnight tomorrow.SPP Media\u0027s editorial director David Bourn said: \"This is a last call for you to tell us about the real heroes who go above and beyond to make your community, workplace or school a special place.\"Highland Heroes wants to celebrate the contribution people in our area make to the lives of others by giving them the recognition they deserve.\"So if you know a Highland Hero, now is the time to share their story.\"To nominate somebody for the awards, visit www.surveymonkey/r/HighlandHeroes2018 or email heroes@spp-group with your name, address, email and phone number, along with the person you are nominating, up to 200 words to explain why, and their contact details.After the deadline closes, a judging panel will draw up a shortlist in each category before readers are given the opportunity to vote for their favourites in a special supplement we will publish in September.The winners of each category, along with an overall hero, will be announced at a ceremony at the Kingsmills Hotel in Inverness on Thursday, November 8.The awards are sponsored by Inverness Airport.* Click here to read more about Highland Heroes.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 12:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117280.jpg","title":"Exhibition plans revealed after dinosaur find","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt comes amid excitement at the recent discovery of dinosaur footprints near the city \u0026ndash the first time they have been discovered on the Scottish mainland.Inverness museum, which is bidding for \u0026pound15,500 from the Inverness Common Good Fund to stage the exhibition, says British Dinosaurs will have the \u0026ldquowow factor and believes it would benefit the city centre.In its application for funding, the museum stated: \u0026ldquoThere is huge public demand for a dinosaur exhibition but to date we have not been able to fulfil this demand because our venue is too small and the high costs involved are unaffordable.\u0026ldquoHowever, we have managed to source an exhibition which will be tailored for Inverness Museum and Art Gallery which will have the wow factor.The exhibition, set to take place between November and late January, will contain casts of dinosaur skeletons including a plesiosaur, the type suggested to be the Loch Ness Monster.Objects from Perth Museum and the Dinosaur Museum in Skye will also be on show plus interactive and holographic displays.Exhibitions officer Cathy Shankland said if it goes ahead, it would involve extending the usually reduced winter hours.\u0026ldquoEveryone loves dinosaurs, she said.\u0026ldquoThe fact there has been the discovery of footprints on the city\u0027 doorstep makes it even more exciting.Alison Parfitt, collections engagement curator, said High Life Highland services had run a summer activity programme with a dinosaur focus while a creative challenge, the Design-a-Saurus, is being developed with a strong science, technology, engineering and maths focus.Dr Neil Clark, curator of palaeontology at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, announced last week he had found dinosaur footprints, thought to be 170 million years old, at a coastal site near Inverness.- The latest applications to the Inverness Common Good Fund will be presented to the city committee on Thursday.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 12:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04013000/04013055.jpg","title":"Highland Council clampdown over budget worries","story":"HIGHLAND Council chiefs are bashing out revised proposals to defer spending, accelerate savings and \u0026ldquorestructure recruitment to avert a \u0026pound5.1 million budget overspend.A bitter political row overshadowed a resources committee debate on it. Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond.

I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary.

But Cllr Gowans added: \u0026ldquoInverness schools are one of the biggest budget pressures we\u0026rsquore going to face. The last estimated cost to resolve the issue would be something like \u0026pound200 million.\u0026ldquoThat would affect every single service within this council \u0026ndash not just Inverness. But they\u0026rsquove been restricted to Inverness members.\u0026ldquoI cannot fathom why such important issues as Inverness schools, and the implications that has for the resources of Highland Council, are not being brought forward in an open, transparent way in the chamber so they can be discussed.\u0026ldquoThat way, we could reassure communities that this matter is being addressed.Ross and Cromarty area committee chairwoman Fiona Robertson, an independent councillor, did not join the chorus but, speaking after the committee meeting, said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to the allocation of the grant, then all councillors need to be involved at a much earlier stage.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 12:36

That is how it played out.“Steve is one of the game’s good guys but when I saw his phone ringing me when we finished training on Friday morning it was never really going to be anything that would be welcomed by us at that late stage.“How can you replace McKenna with five or six hours to go in a transfer window?“The figure that they offered wasn’t enough anyway but certainly the timing was the biggest factor in all of it.“We picked up an injury to Tommie Hoban and with Mark Reynolds out it is in not an area where we would have a lot of options.“So we wanted to have enough time to try to address that if the offer had been significant enough for us to accept it.“And it wasn’t.”McInnes was frustrated at the decision to dismiss Devlin just five minutes into the game and refused to rule out an appeal.He was also disappointed that referee Craig Thomson awarded a free-kick that Kilmarnock netted the opener from.He said: “We will look at maybe appealing that if it is going to be worthwhile.“But sometimes these things aren’t worthwhile.“I feel disappointed with some of the decisions.“It is tough when you go down to 10 men so early on.“Rightly or wrongly, whether he has deemed that as the last man going through, that is debatable to say the least.“We feel really aggrieved by the build-up to their first goal.“It was actually the player’s bad control on his own arm and the momentum pushed it forward in his own path and he got that side of my full-back Max Lowe.“That should have been deemed a hand ball.“My first thought was Graeme Shinnie had won the ball when Craig Thomson blew for the free-kick.“Brophy scored a fantastic goal over the wall which is well executed but there is a clear handball in the build-up.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/sports.jpg ","title":"aberdeens the perfect playground for freshers articleisfree","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor students just starting at one of Aberdeen’s colleges or universities it can be daunting trying to figure out where to eat, drink and exercise.If you don’t know where to go, or have people to point you in the right direction, you can be lost in a sea of possibility.There’s so much on offer.

It was a fantastic successful summer.“We had between 200 and 300 kids in at different stages.”The Food and Fun programme was supported by the Scottish Government.Dave said: “We supplied the food through fare-share produce.“If we didn’t have the right ingredients, we bought it.“The food was brought into school kitchens or we made up sandwiches.“We had parents involved as well.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym. Both plans are now subject to council approval.

much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh

used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents.

local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"merger-of-prestonpans-schools-proposed","story":"  East Lothian Council launches a public consultation exercise on Monday where members of the public are asked for their thoughts on the potential move.  If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see.

A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

The site is located around Longniddry Farm, to the south of the vilage\u0026rsquos railway line, and follows the approval by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee of 450 new homes at the site last August, with formal planning permission in principle issued in June.  The initial plans were approved despite concerns that the new development could split the village in two.  The development includes about 25 per cent affordable homes plus associated commercial and retail space, community facilities, infrastructure and green space.  The commercial and retail space is being delivered separately by Socially Conscious Capital, acting for landowner, Wemyss and March Estates.  Should permission be received, it is anticipated that construction could start on site early next year.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level. It is an honour that we have been shortlisted as one of eight finalists in this category."},{"url":null,"title":"aberlady-street-to-be-without-power-for-most-of-the-day","story":"  Scottish Power is carrying out work on the village\u0026rsquos Kirk Road, with work to take place until 6pm.

A planning application has been lodged with the local authority for \u0026ldquoalterations, extension to redundant water tank to form one house and associated works.  A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.  The application is for a two-storey house, with disabled access from the first floor and a car park on land adjacent to the ground floor.  It is proposed that the upper floor will contain an entrance hall, family  shower room, three bedrooms and an open-plan kitchen/dining room and sitting room, as well as stairs to the ground floor. On the ground floor, there will be a guest bedroom, family shower room, access to the cellar and garage and a drawing room.  The plans have been submitted by agent Tom Pyemont of Hawick-based firm Pyemont Design greenarchitecture on behalf of applicants James Barbour and Alex Dale.  However, when they were discussed by members of North Berwick Community Council earlier this month, members felt that they did not have enough information to make any detailed comment on the planning application.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.  The committee voted by nine votes to two to support the officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to refuse the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-co2-emissions-on-the-rise-in-east-lothian","story":"  The latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that CO2 emissions from freight and passenger transport rose by 4.2 per cent in the county between 2011 and 2016.  That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.

In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8486553.jpg?type=article-full","title":"five-women-in-business-speak-out","story":"  All women can think of another woman who has inspired her to try a career in business, education or industry.

Rather than viewing distilling as chemical engineering, Helen found it felt far more artistic - all based on the creative expression of how it looks, smells and tastes. After inheriting an old family book detailing how her relatives used to distil on the family farm, Helen realised distilling was part of her history and heritage.    With derelict out-buildings on her family\u0026rsquos farm, Helen had a fresh appreciation for these old spaces once viewed as a millstone around her neck. Buildings that were near fresh spring water, surrounded by botanicals created a unique opportunity.  Gin attracted Helen initially as the old distilling manual described how people used to flavour spirits with whatever was around them. The farm had a wealth of natural botanicals, including Scottish juniper, so suddenly this untapped heather hill was incredibly valuable.  The gin is named Badvo, after Helen\u0026rsquos family farm where the stories of distilling inspired Helen when starting out. The heron logo represents the fresh spring water used, as only a very pure spring can support enough fish for a heron. To fund the start-up, Helen pre-sold the first batch of 105 bottles collectively for \u0026pound6,500, going on to use the money to unlock match funding, which snowballed until the entire distillery was grant funded.    Helen commented: \u0026ldquoI got a lot of flak for being a solo entrepreneur. Yes, there are downsides to being a one-man band, but it gives you the opportunity to be dynamic. You can make a decision and you don\u0026rsquot have to justify it to anyone or get it past any board.  \u0026ldquoIt hurts occasionally when people assume someone else set up the distillery as I am too young or too female to have accomplished this alone. I just don\u0026rsquot think some people can comprehend how you can cover so much ground at this stage in life, but I think this is the perfect time.

On the contrary, her peer group expected that students of both sexes could progress to further education, and into careers of our choice. This certainly was Julie\u0026rsquos experience.    Graduating from Glasgow University, Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 1993, Julie then went on to complete the required post-graduate Diploma in Legal Practice in 1994. A legal Traineeship commenced immediately, and she was formally admitted as a solicitor in 1995, at the age of 23. By 27, Julie had been promoted to partner. At that time, she was one of the youngest female partners in a law firm in Scotland. By 2015, more than 60 per cent of solicitors under the age of 40, practising in Scotland, were women \u0026ndash unimaginable in 1995, far less in 1918. For the following 11 years, Julie practised a wide range of areas of law and managed three of her firm\u0027s\u0026nbspbranch offices. She was in charge of HR, and worked long hours.  In 2010, Julie decided to leave the relative security of her large firm behind. Seeking a better work/life balance, she set up her own firm \u0026ndash Millen Solicitors. Hard work continued, and although she faced pressures of a different kind as a sole practitioner, she succeeded in achieving a balance, not only for herself, but for every member of her team.  From the outset, Julie envisaged a practice which would provide an exceptional level of service to clients, and a collegiate and stimulating environment for employees. These values continue at the core of Millen Solicitors as they approach the end of their 8th successful year.    \u0026ldquoFamily Solicitors For Generations is the business maxim, with a nod to their specialisms in all aspects of family law, as well as powers of attorney, wills and executries. Julie and her team provide an outstanding, supportive and compassionate service to families, parents, grandparents and children in times of crisis or uncertainty, at ying stages of their respective lives. Their clients agree, with the majority of work now coming in the form of referrals from satisfied clients, and professional colleagues seeking their expertise.  Julie comments: \u0026ldquoI am proud to have contributed to the cracking of the \u0026ldquoglass ceiling, and I look forward to seeing Scotland\u0026rsquos entrepreneurial women achieve its eventual demise.

The first inklings of Project White took shape in February 1998 thanks to Gus Macdonald. Macdonald had risen from humble beginnings as an apprentice in the Govan shipyards to become one of the most significant figures in Scottish journalism. A glittering career saw him rise to director of programmes for STV by the mid-1980s and, after Tony Blair took power in 1997, he was made a life peer, taking his seat in the Lords as Baron Macdonald of Tradeston. He went on to become Minister of Transport and Cabinet Office Minister.  Macdonald, today in his mid-70s, was a powerful and influential man in the late 90s. At the end of 1997, he was appointed non-executive chairman of Scottish Media Group, then owners of both STV and The Herald. As a leftwing big beast in the media, Macdonald was a man uncomfortable with the state of the Scottish press \u0026ndash for both political and business reasons. He felt the right-wing tilt of the Scotsman skewed the national debate, and also worried that The Scotsman \u0026ndash combined with its sister paper Scotland on Sunday \u0026ndash was a threat to both The Herald\u0026rsquos circulation and advertising revenues. So he hit on an idea \u0026ndash what if The Herald had a Sunday title as well \u0026hellip  One of the other big beasts of British and Scottish journalism in the 90s was Andrew Jaspan \u0026ndash a gifted maverick and an inspirational leader who had edited The Observer, The Sunday Times Scotland, The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday. In early February 1998, Jaspan received a phone call from Macdonald out of the blue. Macdonald asked if they could meet in the House of Lords.  \u0026ldquoBack in the 1970s, Jaspan says, \u0026ldquoGus would have wanted a blether over a pint of beer, in the 1980s it might have been a glass of wine, now he tempted me with \u0026lsquotea served in the finest House of Lords\u0026rsquo bone china\u0026rsquo.  Macdonald had a simple proposition: would Jaspan be interested in setting up a new Sunday paper? Jaspan quickly agreed and soon he and the CEO of Scottish Media Group, a reserved but affable and media-savvy former accountant called Andrew Flanagan, met in London. Flanagan asked Jaspan to come up with a feasibility study \u0026ndash how much would this paper cost, how many staff would he need, how much money could it pull in, and most importantly: what would the paper stand for. Jaspan was told to keep the entire scheme utterly under wraps. Not a word was to be breathed to anyone.  Gary Hughes, Flanagan\u0026rsquos deputy, told Jaspan it was to be called \"Project White\". Jaspan asked why \u0026ndash Hughes replied \"because we have given you a blank sheet of paper\".  What followed next was a five-month period of intense and secretive work by Jaspan in order to get the figures right, mould the editorial philosophy, and come up with the branding and marketing for a new paper for Scotland \u0026ndash one of the most crowded newspaper markets in the world. By the end of August, Jaspan delivered Flanagan his masterplan.  He wanted to create a paper that felt young and aspirational.  The world had changed drastically by the time 1998 came to a close \u0026ndash the age of deference was dead, the Cold War was over, the Good Friday Agreement had been signed bringing peace to Northern Ireland, and Scotland was soon to get her own parliament again. Facile as it may sound today, back then \"Cool Britannia\" \u0026ndash a cocktail of Britpop, the craze for young British artists like Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst, fashion designers like Alexander McQueen, a new youthful Labour government, and a growing economy \u0026ndash seemed to sum up a country brimming with hope and change.  \u0026ldquoHistory was in the making and I wanted a paper that would embrace this change, Jaspan says. When it came to the new era of devolution, he wanted the paper to \u0026ldquowelcome the opening of a new chapter for Scotland. That\u0026rsquos not to say the paper would be a cheerleader, but we would give the new constitutional arrangements a chance to succeed, and pounce on any ill-thought out policy or actions. It was, then, to be a paper both positive about Scotland \u0026ndash there would be no \"Scottish cringe\" \u0026ndash and a watchdog over those in power. But what would it be called? From the get-go, the title that became the frontrunner was the \"Sunday Herald\".  \u0026ldquoThis instantly told readers that the paper was part of The Herald family, but of course a new Sunday paper, Jaspan says. \u0026ldquoWe had messed around with other neutral names, but no others were seriously considered. The upside was that this would be an easier sell to Herald readers \u0026ndash that is, to ask them to drop Scotland on Sunday and chose a west coast Sunday, the downside was that Edinburgh readers might still shy away from a Glasgow paper.  But the Sunday Herald was never intended to be just a Glasgow paper. Capturing sales and ad revenue on the west coast of Scotland was merely the first step to securing the financial future of a new national title, a newspaper which saw itself on the world stage, not on simply the British or Scottish stage.  With the title and vision in place, Jaspan needed to give the paper \"a look\". How to design a paper that wanted to be different to every other paper on the news stands? This was a paper that wasn\u0026rsquot going to talk down to readers, or tell them how to think \u0026ndash it would take for granted that readers were intelligent and well-read, that they wanted information and entertainment, not dull instruction from above. The look of the paper had to reflect that very modern approach to news.  So, one of the most talented designers in European newspapers made a trek north to Glasgow. Simon Esterson had won plaudits internationally for his work on the redesign of \u0026rsquos G2 section. To Jaspan, when it came to designing the new paper, Esterson was the only person for the job. Perhaps the best way to explain how radical Esterson\u0026rsquos design was is to ask you to turn to the front cover of this paper and look at the masthead \u0026ndash the title is all in lower case, the colours vivid primary blue and red. It 1998, this was a radical approach to newspaper design, and a dramatic way to signal a break with the papers of old. The Sunday Herald was to be simple, elegant \u0026ndash a canvas for what would go on to be award-winning photography and journalism. As the first new paper of the 21st century, Jaspan wanted to \u0026ldquoproduce journalism to read, not flick through.  The paper was to have six elements: five printed sections \u0026ndash News, Seven Days , Sport, Business, Jobs and a magazine \u0026ndash and, crucially, one digital section, a website, marking the Sunday Herald as the only paper to embrace online at this stage. Back then, The Herald and The Scotsman still had no web presence. After the Sunday Herald launched \u0026ndash using its website as an integrated part of the paper \u0026ndash , now one of the world\u0026rsquos most popular news sites, soon followed suit.  By now, everything was in place \u0026ndash apart from people: the staff who would make this still imaginary venture take life. And it was the people that made the Sunday Herald. Anyone \u0026ndash and I mean literally anyone, apart from a few sad souls who just didn\u0026rsquot get the spirit of the paper \u0026ndash anyone who has worked on the title will say without hesitation that not only did it give them the best years of their careers, but it often made their careers, and it made them friends \u0026ndash and sometimes lovers \u0026ndash who last with them until this day.  The first two people to be brought onboard were Charles Magee \u0026ndash a consummate journalist who has mastered every art in the industry \u0026ndash and Richard Walker, one of the most talented, hardworking journalists in the UK. Both had worked with Jaspan at Scotland on Sunday. Magee was to work on a publishing system \u0026ndash a bit like building a bespoke desktop printing press from scratch \u0026ndash and Walker tirelessly fine-tuned design. The three-man team holed up in a backroom in STV that stored the props for the crime show Taggart, working in secret to keep opposition newspapers in the dark.  With the foundations now in place, Jaspan went to the board of directors of SMG in September 1998 and got final approval to launch the paper \u0026ndash the only member of the board who seemed less than enthused was David Montgomery, the notoriously dour Ulsterman who had set up the now defunct Today newspaper, and was then running Mirror Group, which had a stake in SMG. Despite the board\u0026rsquos support, there was a sting in the tale for Jaspan: the board wanted the paper launched by the end of January 1999. He had three months to get one of the most ambitious media projects of the last half-century off the ground, and an entire team \u0026ndash more than 50 staff \u0026ndash to hire.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to recruit a cadre of journalists,Jaspan says, \u0026ldquowho would relish the challenge of working on a new paper, which would be a beacon of editorial excellence in everything it did. I wanted to hire journalists who had fire in their bellies \u0026ndash those who wanted to prove themselves rather than those hacks who just wanted to play the safe game and sleep-walk to their pension. I wanted free thinkers who would give the paper a feel of being new and different, so that we would not just be another ordinary Sunday newspaper.  In the end, that thought \u0026ndash \"No Ordinary Sunday\" \u0026ndash would become the tag line for all Sunday Herald marketing and branding. But it also helped Jaspan focus his mind on the kind of people he wanted working for the new Sunday Herald.  He quickly assembled a team, pillaging the best talent from opposition titles in Scotland and London \u0026ndash what better way to get the jump on Scotland on Sunday than taking its gunslingers and have them turn their firepower on their old employer. When staff were hired they were a little taken aback to find themselves each given a beanie hat \u0026hellip emblazoned with the logo \"No Ordinary Headline\"."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8535346.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ex-celtic-striker-slammed-for-calling-himself-king-of-glasgow-after-switch-to-france","story":"  The forward got bombarded after posting his Twitter message after completing a transfer to French club Lyon for \u0026pound20m.

The Deltapoll for the Best for Britain group also found a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would back unification with the south if Brexit went ahead, especially if it meant the return of a hard border with the Republic.  Best for Britain, which wants a second vote on the 2016 referendum to Leave Europe, said the findings showed leaving the EU threatened the Union on several fronts.  Scotland voted 62-38 for Remain in the EU referendum, but Brexit has so far failed to shift the polls in favour of independence.  The poll of 1022 Scots found 47 per cent of people would vote No in another independence referendum tomorrow, compared to 45% saying Yes, with 8% unsure.  If Brexit was cancelled, the numbers were 47% No, 43% Yes, and 10% unsure.  But when people were asked how they would vote if Brexit went ahead, the numbers flipped to 47% Yes and 43% No .  However the poll did not include a baseline question asking how people voted in 2014, so it is unclear if the sample was wholly representative.  Of the 1199 people polled in Northern Ireland, only 35% would back a united Ireland if Brexit was cancelled, but support jumped to 56% if there was a hard border Brexit.  Theresa May yesterday insisted there would be no second vote on Brexit and no compromises on her soft Brexit Chequers plan unless they were in the \u0026ldquonational interest.  But there were also reports that her former election guru Sir Lynton Crosby was behind a plan to install former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in Downing Street.  It was reported Sir Lynton, who helped Mr Johnson become London mayor, had let staff at his firm CTF Partners liaise with hard Brexit group Change Britain as part of the plan.  Best for Britain chief executive Eloise Todd said: \u0026ldquoWhen people voted in 2016, they didn\u0026rsquot vote to break up the Union and risk both Scotland and Northern Ireland voting for a different future outside the United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoThis is compelling evidence as to why we need to stop and think again.  \u0026ldquoThe public deserve a say on the final deal, with the knowledge that if Brexit happens we could shatter the Union altogether.\"  Scottish Labour MEP Catherine Stihler, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a devastating poll which reveals there is a clear and present danger to the future of the United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories must stop putting the Union at risk and give voters a say on the final Brexit deal.  Professor Sir John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said the poll posed hypothetical questions on one issue, but people decided how to vote based on numerous factors.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat the poll shows is that Scotland\u0026rsquos status inside the Union is problematic irrespective of whether we remain in the EU or not. According to this poll it\u0026rsquos already on a knife-edge and the [Brexit-related] movement is very small.  \u0026ldquoRemain voters become more pro-Indy [when prompted on Brexit] and Leave voters move in the opposite direction, but the net effect is very close to zero.  \u0026ldquoThe 64,000 question is what will happen if we leave the EU and people feel Brexit is a disaster - would public opinion shift enough in favour of independence?  \u0026ldquoWe know that Brexit has made the Yes movement more closely tied to the EU, but that\u0026rsquos also a problem for them, because it means they\u0026rsquore fishing in 62 per cent of the public, much of which is never going to be interested in independence in the first place.  SNP MP Stephen Gethins said: \u0026ldquoWith almost 90% of polls since the referendum showing support for an independent Scotland above 2014 levels, independence is polling at historic highs.  \u0026ldquoAs the deeply damaging consequences of a \u0026lsquoNo deal\u0026rsquo Brexit become clearer, as Scotland\u0026rsquos economy continues to outperform the UK, and as people grow increasingly concerned about the future under Westminster rule, support for Scotland\u0027s ability to take its own decisions in an independent country will only grow further.  Tory MP Colin Clark said: \u0026ldquoThe people of Scotland voted by a significant margin to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014. The body of polling work since then does not suggest any meaningful change in that view.

New details of the case have emerged showing how Lord Glennie in his judgment felt judges in two first tier tribunals  were predisposed to reject the men\u0027s claims of asylum having \"paid little attention\" to other evidence, particular witnesses from the Tron Church in Glasgow, of which the men, referred to only as TF and MA are members.

And they have failed to give adequate reasons for, in effect, disregarding such evidence.\"    Around 130-150 Iranians both asylum seekers and those who had already been granted asylum regularly attend mid-week meetings and Sunday services at the Tron.  The unidentified FTT judge in the case of TF had decided that he was claiming to be a Christian because it would assist him in his asylum claim in the UK.  He had identified \"major inconsistencies\" in his account of distribution anti-regime leaflets in Iran in 2013 before he came to the UK and rejected his claim that he had been arrested and tortured.  The judge went so far as conclude that a letter from a hospital relating to the man\u0027s treatment for physical injuries and sexual harm while in an Iranian prison were fabricated to improve his chances of asylum.  The judge found that TF, who entered the UK legally six years\u0026nbspago on a student visa, had been on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in 2013 undermining his claim that Islam did not play a role in his life.

I would therefore request that this application for permission to remain in the UK be granted so that he may continue to live a useful life in UK society.    The other asylum seeker MA entered the UK illegally in October, 2015 and initially claimed asylum because he was perceived to be a homosexual and at risk if returned, the Court of Session heard.  When the matter came to the FTT the claim was made on the basis of a conversion to Christianity which was not raised before Theresa May, then Home Secretary.  FTT judge took the view that the claim of conversion to Christianity was being kept \u0026ldquoin reserve as a \u0026ldquoPlan B, to be deployed if the initial claim based on perceived homosexual orientation should fail.  And the FTT judge called his claim a \"multi-layered contrivance\" adding: \"He is not a genuine asylum seeker and should be removed from the UK on that basis.\"  The judge felt that a fabrication\u0026nbspof a story about an alleged homosexual encounter appeared to indicate that the appellant is \"someone who is prepared to contrive an account to suit his purposes\".  Four representatives from the Tron backed MA\u0027s asylum bid including Mr Taylor who again warned of persecution if returned to Iran.  But Lord Glennie said that in each case, the FTT, having formed a view on credibility adverse to the men \"appears to have paid little attention to the other evidence available to it, particularly the evidence from the witnesses from the Tron Church, accepting its honesty but giving it little or no weight.    \"It is wrong in principle to form a concluded view of the probable veracity of particular items of evidence and then, from that fixed point, to allow that view to govern the assessment of other evidence in the case. The proper approach is to adopt what is sometimes called an \u0027holistic\u0027 approach, considering all the evidence \u0027in the round\u0027 before arriving at any concluded view on the facts.  He added: \"The judge should not jump too readily to the conclusion that because the appellant has told lies about some matters then his credibility on all matters is fatally undermined.  \"Juries in a criminal trial are commonly directed that the fact that an individual may have lied about one point does not necessarily mean that he is lying about other matters, and the same words of caution should be taken to heart by tribunal judges hearing evidence in immigration and asylum appeals.  \"People have different reasons for not telling the truth, or the whole truth, about particular matters.  He said in the case of TF: \"[The FTT judge] says that he has \u0027looked at all the evidence in the round and taken into account my other findings herein before reaching my conclusions in respect of the appellant\u0026rsquos claimed conversion to Christianity\u0027. But when one looks at his reasons, he does no such thing.  \"What he ought to have done was to look at all the evidence in the case, including the evidence from the Tron Church witnesses, on its own merits before forming a concluded view as to the veracity of the appellant.  \"We cannot say what conclusion he would have reached had he done this, but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a consideration of the evidence from the church, carried out on its merits and without any a priori assumption about the appellant\u0026rsquos lack of credibility, might have led him to form a different view of the appellant.\"  Lord Glennie said over the MA decision that the judge expressed concern about \"what appears to be a mean-spirited approach to some of the evidence\".  The FTT judge had referred to the Tron Church as an example of organisations which \u0026ldquoon the face of it at least are bona fide religious institutions or organisations.  Lord Glennie said: \"The use of the expression \u0026ldquoon the face of it at least appears to imply some doubt as to whether or not it is a bona fide religious organisation. If that is what he is saying he should say so clearly and give his reasons. If he has no good reason to doubt its bona fides then he should refrain from this insinuating reference.\"  The judgment said the men\u0027s appeals were heard together because they appeared to raise similar questions relating to the appropriate treatment of certain types of evidence in cases where the genuineness of conversion is challenged.  Lord Glennie said they also raised questions as to the status of evidence from church leaders or others holding positions of responsibility about the conduct of a person who has begun the process of admission into the church and as to the sincerity of his conversion to Christianity."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/3814483.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbc-faces-strict-quotas-to-ensure-it-delivers-on-promises-on-scottish-content-on-new-channel","story":"  Proposed new licence conditions state that 95% of the output of the new BBC Scotland channel must consist of programmes made in Scotland and it must carry news during peak viewing times - between 6pm and 10.30pm.

READ MORE:\u0026nbspNew BBC Scotland channel could spark \u0027golden age...  Other conditions Ofcom wants to write into the Licence also include ensuring the new channels provide a \"range of genres in its programming that reflects Scotland\u0027s culture\". There is a similar condition for BBC Two Scotland which will be discontinued with the new channel launch.  It is further proposed that at least three quarters of the new channel\u0027s output must consist of \u0026lsquooriginal productions\u0026rsquo, an approach previously taken with BBC Alba and BBC Two Scotland.  BBC Two Scotland is expected to provide at least 200 hours of non-news programmes, including Gaelic language output during every financial year.  But Ofcom decided not to propose any conditions relating to Gaelic programming on the new channel, saying the BBC indicated it would not form part of the new channel.  It also ruled out imposing rules that ensure that repeats make up no more than 50% of the new channel. The BBC has already indicated that about 50% of the shows on the channel will be repeats.    But it has warned in its consultation paper: \"Should we be concerned by any aspect of the [BBC Scotland] on-going performance, including the level of repeats, we do not rule out imposing additional licence conditions on the new channel in future, if we consider it is appropriate to do so.\"  The BBC had indicated that the new channel which is expected to go live in February, next year, would have a news programme  covering \"international, UK and Scottish stories, told from a Scottish perspective\", with shorter bulletins at weekends.  It would feature shows that reflect Scottish life, including the opportunity to premiere some new comedy and drama.  The BBC has told the regulator the new channel would be broadcast from 7pm to midnight every evening. In addition, the channel would broadcast BBC Two simulcast from 12 noon to 7pm interspersed with ad hoc events such as live political daytime coverage - particularly First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions - and live sport. Daytime coverage would amount to no more than 150 hours per year.    The BBC has said that the new channel is expected to work in collaboration with other BBC television channels, particularly to enable it to premiere some drama and comedy. This would enable the channel to meet its ambition to schedule a wide range of programmes in the interests of audiences in Scotland.  It has been proposed that the new channel will take the place currently occupied by BBC Four on electronic programme guides  in Scotland. BBC Four would move down the EPG to a less prominent slot.  The Ofcom consultation will close on October 10, 2018 with a final decision on the proposals expected by the beginning of 2019, and before the new channel launch.

Solaris - a tale about scientists probing a huge sentient, oceanic planet and their subsequent contact with unsettlingly strange phenomena - is being adapted for the stage by David Greig, playwright and director of the Lyceum.  The sci-fi tale will have a notable change from the novel and films, as Dr Kris Kelvin, the protagonist, will be a woman.  In the celebrated 1972 film by Andrei Tarkovsky, Kelvin was played by Donatas Banionis, in the 2002 version, he was played by Clooney.  READ MORE: Artistic team announced for Lyceum\u0027s Local Hero  The production will be part of the Lyceum\u0027s 2019/20 season, and is a co-production with the Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne, Australia, where it will open in June 2019.  The play continues the theme of movies playing a role in the Lyceum\u0027s productions: it is also making a stage version of Bill Forsyth\u0027s Local Hero, and Touching the Void, which was also a film based on Joe Simpson\u0027s book.  The cast has yet to be fully confirmed but it will include Eamon Farren, whose recent credits include Richard Horne in Twin Peaks and Cust in The ABC Murders.  The gender reversal in the new play, which will be directed by Matthew Lutton, will mean that the dead lover or partner that haunts Kelvin on her expedition will be a young man, rather than a woman.  Matthew Lutton also directed last year\u0027s production of Picnic at Hanging Rock.  READ MORE: How Midsummer was reborn for the 2018 Festival  Greig said: \"It was Matthew that suggested it.  \"The book has one of the best premises - and the book\u0027s tone is playful, it has a lot more common with Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy and Red Dwarf than you might think: the whole opening chapter is the hilarious history of scientists who have studied Solaris, it is dazzling and funny.  \"But the more I looked it, I thought: why hasn\u0027t this been a play before? It is three people in an enclosed environment [a space station], a new person arrives and they experience visitors, or ghosts, which changes the attitude to what they should do.  \"It is a play: a one room play - now of course outside the room is a giant sentient planet, but the basic premise is there.\"  He said the oceanic planet would present obvious challenges to represent on the stage, but ones surmountable with special theatrical effects and lighting.  Greig added: \"The book has this heart, that really blew me away, because at its core you are looking at this planet that is a sea, but the sea is consciousness, and they cannot work out whether it is God: Does it understand everything? Or is it a child?\"  READ MORE: Greig on \u0027Local Hero\u0027 for the stage  He said that the play, which will feature an international cast, would be primarily drawing from Lem\u0027s novel, rather than the films, for its primary inspiration.  The story, he noted, was also \"deeply about suicide\" and its impact.  Greig said: \"Tarkovky\u0026rsquos film is moving and atmospheric but discovering the novel was like uncovering a whole new layer \u0026ndash lively and witty and playful and strange.  \"But this novel, and our imagining, is also a return to the future as it was conceived in the sixties \u0026ndash science fiction on stage is so often about tin foil, sliding doors and empty space whereas this is about mahogany bookcases, smoking cigarettes and spools of tape.\"  Greig became the eighth artistic director of The Lyceum in 2016.  On the lead role of Dr Kelvin, he said: \"A brilliant thing about sci-fi is that it allows you to say: in 100 years in the future, why on earth would we not expect to see a mixture of races and men and women?  \"So we are hoping to get a multi-ethnic cast from different parts of the world: because why on a space station would it not be like that?  \"We looked at Kelvin...and I looked at the suicide of the lover: Kelvin\u0027s lover in the book is his wife who committed suicide at 20, and she really doesn\u0027t have a personality.  \"When you flip it, there are just fewer stereotypes of the older woman looking back at the younger male lover.  \"Kelvin is a psychologist and an astronaut: it is a fantastic part to play.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-overtake-tories-as-uks-second-biggest-party-data-suggests","story":"  Data collated by the House of Commons Library estimated the Nationalists have just under 125,500 members, compared to the Tories\u0026rsquo 124,000.

A fund-raising campaign to continue his legal battle to remain in the UK has raised over \u0026pound17,000 Adoboli who is Ghanaian, but has lived in the UK since the age of 12, does not hold British citizenship.    The 38-year-old, who describes himself as British, has since his release from jail given many talks to students, financial traders and others in the banking industry about how to operate ethically and avoid making the mistakes he made.  He had been reporting once a month to the Home Office and had feared that he may be arrested in preparation for deportation after he was denied permission to judicially review the deportation proceedings.

Mr McDonald said the prohibitive fees and legal costs now involved in the application process were putting citizenship out of reach for too many children, particularly those living in disadvantaged and low income families.  \u0026ldquoThis indefensible Tory policy amounts to a citizen tax and risks leaving young people in a precarious status without the vital protections that citizenship affords such as freedom from immigration control and access to student finance, employment, housing, social security, healthcare, and other important services.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe appalling treatment of these children is yet another example of the damaging impact hostile Tory immigration policies are having on our society and another reason why immigration powers must be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, so Scotland can create a system that meets our needs and values.  The Home Office has said that above-cost immigration fees are maintained in order to raise funds for the wider immigration system."},{"url":null,"title":"guide to screen locations marks scots tv pioneer anniversary","story":"        As Scotland marks the 130th anniversary of the birth of the Scottish \u0026#8220pioneer of television\u0026#8221, the national tourism organisation has launched a guide aimed at set-jetting TV fans, including locations in Aberdeenshire.                \u0027TV Set in Scotland\u0027, produced by VisitScotland, contains details of more than 60 television programmes, which have either been filmed in Scotland or have Scottish links.                                                    The guide references some of the TV programmes which have showcased Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire on the small screen, including The Crown, the Netflix drama about the early reign of Queen Elizabeth II, filmed in ious locations in Aberdeenshire including Cruden Bay and Slains Castle Roughnecks, about the lives of workers on a fictional oil rig and filmed in and around the Granite City and Stonemouth, where the coastal town of Macduff plays the key destination role.

Scotland’s appearances on TV have the potential to reach huge global audiences and, with research finding that one in five visitors are inspired to visit after seeing it on-screen, the opportunities for the tourism industry are immense.”The latest figures show that spend on film and TV in Scotland in 2017 reached £95 million – the highest level since records began – and a £26 million increase on the previous year.

Due to past alcohol misuse, coupled with a previous conviction and mobility issues, he has found it difficult to get back in to employment.                                                     Joe has been on Fair Start Scotland for six weeks.  Through his vocational profiling talks with his adviser he identified his Job Goals and opportunities for finding work.         He has a previous experience in construction and contacts in the industry, so he felt he could secure work in this sector with some support. In agreement with his adviser, Joe felt that getting a Construction Skills Certification Scheme  card and gaining skills in Portable Appliance Testing  would be the best start to his journey to find work. With this combined training behind him, he could seek work which would involve inspection for minor defects or omissions in building works coupled with testing electrical equipment. Joe has now passed his CSCS training and got his Site Operative card, completed Control of Substances Hazardous to Health  training and updated his employability skills.                                                                                                          Joe’s Fair Start Scotland advisor helped him in setting up his ‘Find A Job’ account and supported him with job searching. Going forward, Joe will continue his journey to find a job that suits his circumstances. Joe said: “So far I have found Fair Start Scotland helpful and my adviser has been encouraging and supportive. I’ve done training I didn’t know about like basic IT skills, and updated my skills in construction and health and safety.”Fair Start ScotlandFair Start Scotland is Scotland’s new devolved employment support service. It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.                                                                                                        Launched in April this year, the service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is voluntary. This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose – choosing to participate won’t affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions. The service is based on partnership and joint working between the Scottish Government, and the public, third and private sectors to deliver better outcomes for people seeking employment support. Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: “We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential. “As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.”                                                                                                        To find out more and check whether you are eligible, visit www.mygov.scot/fairstart                "},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classification of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 12:50

We have had great support from the community and are committed to Thurso and Caithness.Kevin Brundish, chief executive of AMTE Power, said: \u0026ldquoThe combination of world-leading British innovation from QinetiQ coupled with the manufacturing capability of AMTE allows customers access to new and exciting energy storage options, giving them a choice beyond the existing supply chain.\u0026ldquoThe new products will see step change in capability and alternative options for our technology customers.Mike Sewart of QinetiQ said: \u0026ldquoWe recognise that our strengths lie in research, prototyping and scale-up of cutting-edge battery technology and not in large-scale manufacturing. This partnership will help us to take our technology to a broader customer base and provides us with the manufacturing support and expertise we need.AMTE is a privately owned company and is the UK\u0026rsquos only volume cell manufacturing facility.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 12:50 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New group set up to save Trinkie","story":"MEMORIES of the golden era of the Trinkie came flooding back this week when a new group was set up with the intention of restoring Wick\u0026rsquos famous outdoor pool to its former glory.From the reflections, you\u0026rsquod think people were talking of the sun-swept coast of Spain, or \u0026ndash more closely \u0026ndash the holiday camp pools of Butlin\u0026rsquos or the 1980s TV show Hi-de-Hi.A significant number of Wick residents turned up to the meeting at the Francis Street Club, where it was decided to form the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group.A previous group was disbanded earlier this year, blaming a \u0026ldquolack of community support.Friends of the Trinkie said it had enjoyed maintaining the outdoor pool at Wick\u0026rsquos South Head over the years, and stressed that it had not been an easy decision.For years, the lido on the Pulteneytown seafront formed a communal gathering spot, not just where people learned to swim, but also for barbecues, get-togethers and family occasions. Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 12:50 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 12:50 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

With these beach cleans we’re taking that commitment one step further, helping sweep our shorelines for litter and collate vital local data that will be fed back to the Marine Conservation Society.”“The results from previous years’ Great British Beach Cleans are thought to have been instrumental in bringing about environmental legislation such as the plastic bag charge and banning of microplastics in personal care products, so the more local faces that join in, the bigger the potential difference we can all make.”The Great British Beach Clean is organised by the Marine Conservation Society  and takes place annually in September.Scottish Sea Farms are looking for volunteers to take part in their effort.They have asked anyone planning to join in to should register, via https:www.mcsuk.org/beachwatch/events/gbbc, and should wear appropriate clothing with pickers, gloves and bags to be provided.The meeting point of the Echna Loch Bay event, will be at lay-by on the road next to the bay, down the hill from the fossil centre, and the meeting point for the Weyland Bay event will be at the lay-by opposite the sewage treatment works on Carness Road.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will briefly divert cars onto the adjacent railway track and back again at set windows during the day when trains are not passing by.But motorists who miss one of the windows could face waits of up to two-and-a-half hours for the next one.And this has prompted Highland Council to urge drivers to make sure they plan their journey and allow enough travel time so they are not caught out.A council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor TRAC Engineering Ltd to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road\u0026ldquoBut inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits \u0026ndash so we urge people to plan their travel carefully and avoid the periods when the diversion is not going to be available.During the works the road will be closed overnight to all traffic between the two gates between 10pm and 7am.Traffic control measures will operate between 7am and 10pm while the road-to-rail bypass is installed. This could take up to two weeks, but may be finished sooner.Once the temporary bypass is installed, the timetable of opening slots between trains will take effect.Cards showing details of the timetable that will be operating for the road to rail diversion have been distributed among local communities.Copies are also available at the Highland Council website by searching for Stromeferry Bypass at www.highland.gov.ukThe road-to-rail bypass will be available for use between 7am and 10pm, but only by traffic weighing less than seven-and-a-half tonnes .Traffic above those limits will have to divert along the A87, A82, A832 and A890.The council believes the restrictions and roadworks will be finished by November 24, when the A890 will fully reopen.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 12:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0026rsquos vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0026rsquos making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0026rsquos deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0026rsquos the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 12:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances. You never know what is round the corner nor what can suddenly appear from the side of the roads.\u0026ldquoRural roads are there to be used by all, which includes cycles, walkers and horse riders. Patience and respect for all users and educating is the key. As they say, speed kills.The appeal to drivers to rein in their speed and to be aware of other road users followed near-misses on the B9169 Cullicudden straight. Police say they recognise the vulnerability of horses on roads and encourage motorists and riders to show mutual respect for each other.They say all road users should be able to travel safely and drivers should give horses as much room as possible when passing. They want road users to read the Highway Code for guidance.- Email us at newdesk@spp-groupTuesday 4 Sep 2018 12:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

One is the Climate Change Bill where Scottish Labour has joined the Scottish Greens in calling for net zero emissions rather than the 90 per cent cut proposed by the SNP. Of course, percentages tend to leave the public cold. So it’s worth trying to visualise the differences between a very sizeable cut in our contribution to global warming and an absolute end.            The SNP’s 90 per cent target means electric buses, trains and cars will be standard transport modes by 2050 and the planning system will reduce the demand for travel and bring employment closer to where people live. To go further and reach net zero emissions, Scotland must also tackle the difficult areas of aviation and shipping and explore ideas like electric/hydrogen ferries and electric planes, which are being built and piloted in the Nordic nations now. Flights to the sun for summer holidays will still be possible – but at 2005 levels.To make progress in agriculture, we must cut current ­levels of meat and dairy consumption and production. It was noticeable at a recent conference in Finland that the default in hotels, cafes and universities is already almond, not cow’s milk. But for Scotland to reach net zero, far more will have to change. We may need new breeds of cows and sheep, which emit less methane and a new diet for animals. Our farming and food science institutes must start that kind of experimentation now. Industry will change dramatically under either scenario. Our oil and gas dependence must end by 2050 and there can be no new oil fields developed in the North Sea except where they supply developing nations, on the grounds that existing operations cause less eco-damage than drilling elsewhere from scratch. Companies and investment funds will have divested from fossil fuels to avoid being left with “stranded assets” as oil-based products and services become ­economically unviable. Much energy and imagination will be needed to replace cement and plastics. Where that isn’t ­possible, Scotland will have to offset using carbon capture technology  and will have to get funding agreement or political ­control from Westminster.            Heating will have to be electric by default to reach the 90 per cent target so air and ground source heat pumps will have to be affordable and commonplace. That demands a big rise in insulation and some frank discussion about whether ­utilities are up to the task. Net zero emissions means more district heating, and imaginative solutions for rural areas like hydrogen generated by renewables as ­Orkney is already doing. Tree planting will escalate rapidly because a small amount of emissions can be mitigated by planting forests to store carbon. Reafforestation demands a big debate – will big landowners be allowed to evict tenants for tree-planting grants or will the opportunity be seized to effect land reform and diversify the rural economy?These changes can boost the economy if Scotland’s politicians are resolute. We can be ahead of the manufacturing curve and not just left buying foreign innovation. Cyclotricity is relocating from ­England to Glenrothes to manufacture electric bicycles and Star Renewables – whose heat pumps use fjord water to power the Norwegian town of Drammen – could do the same in every coastal Scottish town and city. But innovation and investment is needed now so we don’t import zero-emissions related-technology as we have imported most wind turbines. All these changes are essential because Scotland’s success in tackling carbon emissions  is largely in energy production  and waste  while reductions in agriculture , residential heating , and transport  have been far lower.             The low hanging fruit have almost all been picked. If the Scottish Government still wants the most ambitious climate change targets in the world, it must tackle bigger structural issues. Norway’s Conservative-led Government has just promised to reach zero emissions by 2030, Sweden’s target is 2045 and the French target is 2050.Does Scotland’s devolved government control enough budget, taxes and levers to deliver the same? Will the public support dramatic change or will the ­prospect of more warm, dry summers and the impending chaos of Brexit combine to let politicians off the hook? What will change minds – food prices rising further as a downside of the dry summer? How about predictions that more melting ice could shift the Gulf Stream, which guarantees Scotland’s mild climate? This year wild fires covered the globe an unprecedented heat wave killed dozens in Japan and thick sea ice off Greenland has broken up for the first time on record. The world is witnessing ­tipping points aplenty. Can these extreme climate events be ­written off as insignificant or mere coincidence?Matters will come to a head during October’s SNP conference when the IPCC is due to release its latest statement on what countries must do to hold warming below the 1.5C limit demanded by the Paris Agreement. Actually, UK emissions have fallen faster since 2010 than in any other G7 nation except Italy – mostly through a switch away from coal-fired electricity.In July, more than 100 MPs wrote to the Prime Minister calling for a target of net zero emissions by 2050. In short, there may just be the appetite for real political cooperation across borders and ­party lines. Sadly the imminent chaos and recrimination of Brexit may soon end that.            Of course, politicians are frightened of confronting voters with the scale of change needed to move from the oil to the renewables age. Scotland’s remaining oil has for too long been integral to the case for independence – will the SNP be able to move beyond Scotland’s Oil as a slogan and aspiration? Will Scottish Labour’s new enthusiasm for net zero emissions be shared by Jeremy Corbyn and will the ­party weaponise Scotland’s inevitable transition away from oil as a new way to attack independence? It may be unduly optimistic, but focus on climate change could yet transform Scottish society – if we are all ready to raise our game."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4794068.1535976811!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp overtake tories to become second biggest party in uk","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27465  ","story":" Mícheál Mac Donncha\n\nON THE afternoon of Tuesday 30 August 1988, three IRA Volunteers were travelling along the main Omagh to Carrickmore road in County Tyrone. They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

praised other successes within the Year 12 group, particularly 14 students who have completed the Prince’s Trust course, gaining a Level Two qualification equivalent to two GCSEs at Grade B.  \n\nIn addition, 12 students have achieved Level 2 qualifications in Occupational Studies, equivalent to GCSEs at A*-C.  \n\nHe also congratulated 10 students who have completed the Coaching Academy Award, which is equivalent to four GCSEs at Grade B.\n\n“As a non-selective school, we celebrate success at all levels across the full range of ability,” Dr Knox said.\n\nHe added: “These are vocational courses, many of which our students access through the Northern Regional College, and they aim to broaden the educational experience of the young people, with a view to preparing them for further training or apprenticeships.  \n\n“I am delighted that these students have successfully embraced this opportunity, and I would like to thank the staff of the Northern Regional College for the partnership we enjoy, which is obviously benefiting our students.”\n\nDr Knox wished all of the school’s Year 12 students success in the next stage of their education and welcomed many of them back to begin Sixth Form studies in St Patrick’s. \n            \n    \n    try   catch

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

champions","story":"\n\nPAUL\n Munster has been appointed at the Technical Director and first team coach of Indian champions Minerva Punjab FC. \n\nThe former Linfield and Cliftonville striker joins the club after guiding Örebro SK to their maiden U19 Swedish Cup success last year. \n\nMunster had been mulling over whether or not to continue his career in Sweden. In an interview with Belfast Media Group last November, Munster hinted at remaining in European football.\nHowever, those plans are now on the back burner for the Belfast native as he prepares to take charge of the Indian champions, who will embark on their first AFC Champions League campaign this season and Munster says he is excited by the challenge. \n\n“I have always been going up and achieving more and more each time, even in the coaching courses,” said Munster. \n\n“Everything has been going well and now it’s a great time for some new experience, especially in India. \n\n“Joining a club that has been playing in the highest level, are the current champions and the fact that they are going to play in the AFC Champions League, it’s just perfect. I’m moving in the right direction.” \n\nMunster was also well travelled as a player. Having started his career with Celtic Boys in West Belfast, he played for Cliftonville youths before moving to Canada. Munster later linked up with Slavia Prague and, on his return to Belfast, he signed for Linfield and helped the Blues secure the League and Irish Cup double in 2010 and 2011. \n\nMoving to the north Indian club didn’t phase Munster in the slightest and he is relishing the prospect of helping Minerva Punjab FC secure more silverware in the near future.\n\n“I was looking into Minerva Punjab a few months back, doing research on their scores and social media to see how it is and the first thing that I noticed was Mr Ranjit Bajaj, the owner is very passionate about the club,” added Munster. \n\n“He wants the team to be the best at all levels and that is what I liked a lot.” \n\n“For me, it’s a challenge, a new experience but I am coming here to win. As a player, I’m used to winning leagues, cups, individual awards. Coming here as a coach and working at the highest level in India and also playing in the AFC Champions League, it will be a great experience.”\n\nIn a statement posted on the club’s website, Minerva Punjab FC owner Mr Ranjit Bajaj, added: “We are excited to have Paul on board. He comes in with a lot of experience both as a player and as a coach and we believe that he can contribute a lot to this club. \n\n“We believe that both of us together can achieve great things at this club.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glider goes live","story":"\n\nTHE\n New Belfast Rapid Transit Glider system has become fully operational today. \n\nThe £90million Glider system will travel the new cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and from the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nThe new controversial 12-hour bus lanes built to accommodate the service will operate from 7am and 7pm Monday to Saturday.\n\nLast week, the Department for Infrastructure announced that a 12-month scheme allowing private hire taxis to use the lane has been put on hold.\n\nIn West Belfast some parents have expressed concerns that the bus lane that passes one local school have left them with nowhere to drop off or pick up their children.\n\nDrivers have been warned not to park in the new bus lanes, but at St Kevin’s Primary School on the Falls Road, many parents felt they had no choice but to flout the rules.\n\nSt Kevin\u0026#8217s Primary School Principal Fiona Keegan said: “I don\u0026#8217t think it\u0026#8217s an ideal situation at all. It\u0026#8217s very unfortunate that our parents are now in a position where they have nowhere safe to drop their children off in the mornings and are being forced into the local streets, which is causing congestion. \n\n“Not all of my children come from the local surrounding area and therefore can walk to school. We service families from beyond West Belfast, a lot of parents do have to travel. Also, although we are a mainstream school we have a lot of children who have additional learning needs and any change of their morning routine can be detrimental to them and we have to be very aware of that and for children particularly with any sort of autism diagnosis getting out of a car to walk across a main road is very worrying for a parent.”\n\nSchool caretaker Tony Murphy said: “Many of the parents had no choice but to park in the cemetery this morning which isn\u0026#8217t ideal for anyone, also if you look at the bus lane line, our teachers have to break it to get into the staff car park. The side streets were always busy but now they are going to be ten times worse. We put signs out about parking to stop the parents pulling up and then having to reverse out, in case they hit a child. People are getting picked up in taxis in the outside lane and cars are stopping there and the kids are getting out and crossing the road.”\n\nOne local man who did not wish to be named said: “I\u0026#8217m a taxi man but this morning I decided to get my bike out and see what it would be like in the bus lane. I\u0026#8217ve cycled from the Michael Ferguson roundabout to here, it took me 23 minutes and the Glider has yet to pass me. My intention was to stop it by cycling in front of it, I see some cars parked here in the bus lane and I don\u0026#8217t blame them. People would put up with it if it was for the greater good but it\u0026#8217s not.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"passengers can use glider from today","story":"\nMEMBERS of the public will be able to travel on-board the Glider vehicles during the last days of testing before the service goes live on Monday. \n\nShadow running will see both Glider and  vehicles operating along the Glider routes for three days. Glider services are on schedule to launch on Monday 3 September on cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nWith Monday being the day the schools go back after the summer holidays – which always leads to an increase in traffic – many drivers are bracing themselves for delays along the main arterial routes in West Belast.\n\nRobin Totten, Translink’s Glider Senior Project Manager said they are entering the final phase of testing which will see most of the infrastructure, vehicles and off-board ticketing systems tested by their passengers before they go live on Monday. \n\n“During this final week of testing, passengers travelling on the East – West route will be able to travel on Glider on Thursday 30th August with a valid ticket or Smartcard,” he explained.\n\n“ services will continue to run the scheduled timetable, with Glider ‘shadow running’ more infrequently along the route, calling at Glider halts. \n\n“Glider services during these three days will operate half-hourly from approximately 7am to 7pm. Passengers who have a valid ticket or validated Smartcard will be able to use either  or Glider, if waiting at one of the new Glider halts.\n\n“We have trained around 60 helpers from Volunteer Now, who will assist Translink staff at halts during this final phase to support passengers to get familiar with the exciting new service and ticketing system.  The volunteers will also be in place for the initial introduction of the service to boost passenger confidence and ensure a smooth transition to the new Glider service.\n\n“We have also completed over 150 public information and engagement events along the Glider routes, meeting many community groups, disability groups, businesses and local stakeholders to show them how to use the new services and ticketing, this will now be the an opportunity to try the service for themselves.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that communities and stakeholders right across the city see Glider as a positive development, and are enthusiastic about the introduction of this iconic new service and the benefits it will bring for the city.\n\nTranslink have also published ‘how to use’ guides and short videos on You Tube to help direct and make the service easy to use for passengers.

a welcome hub, a leisure and sports innovation hub, an adventure hub and a theme park hub - will be completed by 2026.\n\nThe council estimates the development will create 200 construction jobs and sustain up to 1,400 jobs on the visitor attraction when operational.\n\nCouncillors also approved the lease of two sites through Lisney commercial estate agents for Evermore Ltd’s proposed £27m development of a data centre to support the digital economy and Viridian Ltd’s plans for a £20m anaerobic digestion facility to generate and export electricity from organic waste.\n\nInspired by the Cave Hill area’s renowned association with Swift’s book, Gulliver’s Travels, Belfast City Council has named the former landfill site Giant’s Park – also fitting as it’s the city’s largest development site, which opened for business in May 2017.\n\nGiant’s Park is already home to a £20m state-of-the-art film studio complex, developed by Belfast Harbour, with NI Screen marketing the film studio to its global industry contact network.\n\nAlderman Jim Rodgers, Chair of Belfast City Council’s Strategic Policy and Resources Committee said: “I’m very much looking forward to seeing this area of the city really coming to life through our regeneration plans. \n\n\"Not only does Giant’s Park offer businesses excellent connectivity through our airports and motorways, there’s the obvious additional benefit of being able to recruit from Belfast’s strong skills and talent base.\n\n“We’ve made a firm commitment to stimulating job creation in the Belfast Agenda, and it’s the central objective of the Belfast Region City Deal proposition that we’re currently working on with our partners. \n\n\"By developing this vast site, we stand to gain jobs, visitors, and vital rates income which we can reinvest in Belfast.”\n\nThe Giant’s Park infrastructure project was part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland  and the European Regional Development Fund , under the European Sustainable Competitiveness Programme for Northern Ireland, along with investment from Belfast City Council.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"parents park on bus lanes outside belfast school as glider launches","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Here we look at what the restrictions will mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– What is being banned?\n\n\nDrinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, like Red Bull, Monster, and Relentless, will be affected.                    \n\nOne regular 250ml can of energy drink contains around 80mg of caffeine – equivalent to almost three cans of cola.\n\nMany popular energy drinks now come in 500ml cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to

They know what the people of the north think. They voted to remain and that should be respected.”\n\nDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said local decision-making had come to a standstill and public services were undermined.\n\n“We have spent the summer engaging with the Government, stressing the need for decisions to be taken.\n\n“People are tired of uncertainty.  It is clear that decisions will now be made at Westminster.\n\n“With Parliament returning this week, the Government will be required to live up to their commitments to ensure the good governance of Northern Ireland.”\n\nHe added: “The people of Northern Ireland deserve better and we will ensure that Westminster acts in their best interest.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"tanaiste embarks on twoday visit to finland estonia and lithuania","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

emphasise that Ireland wants the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including on trade, in order to minimise the impact on our trade and economy, and that it is vital that the EU’s single market and customs union are fully protected.\n\n“We will also discuss key issues of international importance on the EU external agenda, particularly the Middle East peace process and the

Glenn McGrath it wasn’t, but somehow it had the desired effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wicket came in the final over of the match, with tail-ender Ishant caught behind. It’s fair to say it will go down as one of the more meaningless wickets in Test history in terms of the match situation.\n\n“It was a genius bit of bowling,” Cook joked afterwards. “No, it was rubbish to be honest with you, but it’s one more wicket than David Saker, our bowling coach, has got so that makes me very happy.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless current skipper Joe Root allows Cook a ceremonial bowl against India in the final Test of the series – perhaps to have another go at Ishant – it’s likely the 33-year-old will bow out with bowling figures of one wicket for seven runs off 18 balls.\n\nThat would mean he retires with a better average than England’s all-time leading wicket taker, James Anderson.

These initiatives assist young people to take better control of their lives, reengage in training and avoid being drawn into criminal or sectarian activity.\n\nThe remaining funding, £810,000, has also been allocated across four projects in the Peace Impact Programme , which assists marginalised communities to resolve complex issues relating to identity and the conflict. \n\nDr Adrian Johnston, Chairman of the International Fund for Ireland, said: “We still live in a deeply fractured society and political uncertainties are adding greater pressures to communities that are working hard to move forward. The risks taken by groups we support cannot be taken for granted. \n\n\"In many difficult areas, the Fund and these groups are delivering the only interventions that are preventing the escalation of tensions and polarisation. In challenging circumstances, their ambition and vision deserve to be equally met with political action and leadership.\n\n“With the limited resources available, the Fund is making important contributions that support stability and progress, particularly among communities that had not previously recognised a peace dividend. However, the Fund alone is not equipped for the scale of challenges that may emerge during an indefinite political vacuum. \n\n\"Each generation should expect a better life than the last. That can only happen if there is political will and adequate resources to help resolve the legacy issues that continue to blight communities.”\n\nThe Chairman took the opportunity to thank the international donors to the Fund - the European Union and the Governments of the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand - for their support.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nAmong the latest funding drive are these Derry projects:\n\n£202,402 to Causeway Rural \u0026amp Urban Network  for the Building Resilience and Knowledge in Education  Project.

And so, my message to Lindsey and Sean, to these warriors to be ordained today, is to be sure to keep your ministry well-oiled with obedience, integrity and love.”\n\n“It is easy to obey,” Canon Merrick said, “when that obedience seems reasonable and pleasing to our own understanding and desires – and particularly when it’s found pleasing to those around us. But will we waver when we don’t see the results anticipated, though we still believe this is God’s will?” \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nHe shared a remark made by the former US President, John Quincy Adams, whose repeated attempts to have slavery abolished in the 1830s proved fruitless: “Duty is mine, results are God’s.” \n\n“Ministry is a call to abide in Him,” Canon Merrick said, “to serve His will and step out in obedient faith, knowing that duty is ours, results are God’s.”\n\nCanon Merrick said ministry was also a call to integrity. “We must always be careful not to use people to build His church, but to serve people as He builds His church among us. And in all these things, we must be the same person behind the pulpit as we are when we are at home with the family and when we are alone in the study. That is what characterises the woman or man of integrity.”\n\nMinistry was also a call to love, Canon Merrick said. The call to love was not always easy but it always resulted in God’s peace and that was priceless. \n\n“My prayer for you this evening,” Canon Merrick told the two ordinands, “is that your work will always be characterised by obedience, integrity and love, as a well-oiled machine continually advancing the Kingdom of God until the coming of the Kingdom.”\n\nThe choir and choristers of St Columb’s Cathedral provided music for the two-hour long Service of Ordination, after which the congregation made their way to St Augustine’s Parish Hall, on the City Walls, for refreshments and speeches. \n\nReverend Hanily said he and Reverend Farrell needed people’s prayers more than ever now, while Reverend Farrell asked family, friends and parishioners to affirm them both in their ministries. Bishop Good said Derry and Raphoe was blessed to have both new priests joining the Diocese. “We’ve got two stars,” the Bishop said.\n\n\nPictured above: Rev Lindsey Farrell  and Rev Sean Hanily with

Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
