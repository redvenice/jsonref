It is unclear if any more are still set to be brought in from previous deals. The Department of Health paid out roughly £585million on contracts securing visors.This suggests ministers paid the equivalent of nearly £4.80 per visor used, roughly 24 times more than the shields cost when bought in bulk. And of its surplus stock, 339,154,151 are deemed \u0027not fit for use in healthcare settings\u0027. SAGE advisors warned visors were unlikely to give \u0027any protection\u0027 against Covid transmission in July 2020, with the Government placing its last order for visors at the end of June 2020.A Department of Health spokesperson said: \u0027Our priority throughout the pandemic has been saving lives, and we have delivered over 19.1 billion items of PPE to frontline staff to keep them safe.\u0027Having too much PPE was preferable to having too little in the face of an unpredictable and dangerous virus, given this was essential to keep our NHS open and protect as many people as possible.\u0027Now we are confident we have sufficient PPE to cover any future Covid demands, we are taking decisive action to save up to £93 million of taxpayers\u0027 money per year by reducing storage costs for excess stock.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Le Pen closes gap Macron French election campaigns ends today ahead vote Sunday","story":"Share this articleLe Pen’s National Rally party is still paying off a loan worth some £8million to a Russian bank.The far-right leader has long been a firm ally of Mr Putin, though she has criticised Russian war crimes in Ukraine.It comes as Le Pen continues to press for extreme policies including fines for Muslim women who use headscarves to cover their faces in public.‘People will be given a fine in the same way that they are for illegally not wearing seat belts,’ she suggested. Le Pen has also pledged to cut immigration by as much as 75 per cent and to clamp down on new arrivals from bringing their families to France.Le Pen\u0027s efforts to moderate her far-right image were boosted by the candidacy of the even more radical candidate ex-TV pundit Éric Zemmour. Veteran Left wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon was also enjoying a rise in his poll figures. He is expected to win around 17 per cent in the first round, and could feasibly pip Le Pen to a place in the second round run-off.That would be a relief for Mr Macron, a former banker and civil servant who formed his own political movement to challenge for power.He hopes to become the first sitting French president to be re-elected for 20 years. The last head of state to achieve this was Jacques Chirac, who was elected president in 1997 before gaining a second, final term in 2002. The first round of this year\u0027s presidential election will take place on Sunday, with the top two candidates going head-to-head two weekends later on April 24."},{"url":null,"title":"easyJet slammed sharing photo customer flight number tattooed wrist","story":"Share this article Another social media user responded: \u0027Holy s***.

Even when she was at finishing school, Valerie had begun to see through Victor’s naked ambition, according to Mr Light. In one blunt letter she accused him outright of ‘feathering his nest’.Valerie and Rodney’s romance was straight out of Downton Abbey. While working as a plumber, he came to mend the lavatory at the Belmont residence and was ‘gobsmacked’ by her beauty. She was similarly smitten.Having left school at 14, he was a 29-year-old orcee with two children: hardly a suitable type for the Bettys proprietor’s daughter.Claire Belmont tried vainly to end the relationship then urged Mr Light to at least take elocution lessons.‘I said, “Not on your nelly!” I didn’t care what they thought of me,’ he scoffs.Theirs was no society wedding. There wasn’t even a reception. They were married in May 1964 in a Harrogate register office with Claire and Victor acting as reluctant witnesses.Valerie wore her black and white Bettys uniform, ready to dash back to the tearooms for her afternoon shift, but her pinny couldn’t disguise the fact that she was six months pregnant.At first, they lived with Claire Belmont and her eccentric housekeeper, who swigged Guinness and would alternate wearing her shoes on the wrong feet so the soles would wear evenly. But Mr Light worked three jobs and they eventually scrimped enough to buy their own modest house.By then, it was clear Valerie would never rise in the company ranks. After having three children, she worked in the canteen at an ICI factory, and as a shop assistant with Next, before re-joining the family firm to process mail orders for Bettys by Post.When Valerie came home in distress one evening, because Victor had berated her for some perceived failing, Mr Light flew out of the door intending to punch him, but she pulled him back.‘He treated her like muck,’ says Mr Light, fury flashing in his eyes.It appears so, yet many years would pass before they discovered the full extent of his shabbiness.The details are arcane, but during the legal dispute her lawyers claimed that Victor had the company articles altered to Valerie’s disadvantage.She was unable to sell any of her inherited stake in the business outside the company without the consent of other shareholders.These shares were held for her in a trust, and as one of the trustees, Victor was also accused of keeping their value low to avoid paying Valerie high idends.She would receive annual cheques for a few hundred pounds. Mr Light says the truth began to dawn when he went, wired-up with his secret recording device, to that meeting.‘First Victor said Val’s shares were worth ten bob, then maybe a quid. He were making it up as he went along,’ he says, shaking his head.It wasn’t until 1995, when she was 51, that Valerie at last became a wealthy woman. With her £4 million settlement, she bought an enchanting 11th-century house, set in nine acres in a village near Harrogate — and a red Porsche Boxter with personalised plates.She and Rodney holidayed in Mauritius and drove from to Deauville to Paris in his Model T Ford. Sadly, their joy was short-lived. Three years later she died of heart disease, leaving her husband bereft.When he last met Victor Wild, shortly before he died in 2020, he claims the great man asked for his forgiveness. Mr Light’s reply was short and sharp.Today, eight members of the Belmont dynasty hold shares.None of them work in the business, but there is a ‘family council’ whose ethos informs board decisions.This new generation is clearly genuinely committed to upholding the founder’s values.Responding to Mr Light’s story this week, the company said: ‘Maintaining family harmony while running a business is often a challenge for family firms — and there are times in our history when this has been true for us. Although it is nearly 30 years ago, we know that in the early 1990s our family owners had a lot to navigate.‘The period resulted in plenty of learning which now lives on in the way the family work together and shapes the family’s and business’s ways of working.’Coming from a company that has become a national treasure, it was an uplifting message.However, we can safely assume Mr Light will not be joining the throngs queuing for Easter tea in Harrogate this weekend or next.‘Go to Betty’s? Me? I’d bloody-well rather starve,’ he snaps."},{"url":null,"title":"Andrew lot Disgraced duke wants return public life","story":"Share this articleDuchess of York linked to further payment in court case - BBC NewsPrince Andrew, disgraced and downbeat, dreams of a comeback | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle join Prince Harry Invictus Games Netherlands week","story":"Share this articleMeghan Markle and Harry WILL be at Invictus Games on 1st trip since quitting royals - World News - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examMaking important life decisions is never easy - but there are tools to helpJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choice"},{"url":null,"title":"residents in 40 hse run nursing homes living in unsuitable rooms","story":"The report criticises Cherry Orchard Hospital nursing home for housing residents in four ‘very poor quality’ buildings, which ‘do not provide acceptable bedroom accommodation, communal or toilet facilities’.  Photograph: Eric LukeMore than 40 nursing homes run by the Health Service Executive (HSE) are housing residents in rooms or buildings that do not meet healthcare standards, according to an internal State watchdog report. The Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) has told the Government that a large number of public nursing homes were failing to comply with new minimum standards for residents’ bedrooms. From the start of this year nursing homes were required to have no more than four residents sharing a room, and provide adequate inidual and recreational space for residents. An internal Hiqa report sent to Minister of State for older people Mary Butler outlined nearly 70 nursing homes were subject to “restrictive conditions”, as they did not meet Hiqa standards around bedroom space and the condition of buildings. Forty-three of the homes were run by the HSE, 23 by private providers and a further three by voluntary bodies funded by the State.Many of the nursing homes were taking steps to address the shortcomings, such as cutting capacity to reduce the numbers of residents sharing rooms, the report stated.Writing to Ms Butler on January 14th, 2022, Carol Grogan, Hiqa’s chief inspector of social services, warned that nursing homes which failed to improve their facilities could face “escalating regulatory action”. The letter, which accompanied the unpublished report, was released to The  under the Freedom of Information Act.‘Institutional’ environmentsThe regulator’s report said nursing home residents were left living in “institutional” environments. Residents in shared rooms had very little privacy while getting dressed or receiving personal care, and often had “no protection from noises or unpleasant odours” it said. A plan to replace 33 nursing home facilities and refurbish 57 facilities announced in 2016 was running “significantly” behind schedule, it said. Hiqa said the delays in new nursing home facilities being built had been “well flagged” with the HSE.The report noted the risks of residents living in shared rooms came to a head during the Covid-19 pandemic, with nursing home residents accounting for a large portion of those who died during outbreaks of the virus. Some residents and staff were concerned that refurbishment work to bring older buildings into line with Hiqa regulations would mean plans to move to a new facility would be shelved, the report said. It said where nursing homes were not brought into line with standards around rooms and building conditions, “escalating regulatory action will be necessary”, which could include shutting down care homes. The report criticised Cherry Orchard Hospital nursing home for housing residents in four “very poor quality” buildings, which “do not provide acceptable bedroom accommodation, communal or toilet facilities”. A HSE spokeswoman said many nursing homes were in buildings “in excess of 100 years old”, and a programme had been agreed with the Department of Health and Hiqa to bring them into line with required infrastructure standards. Several facilities had seen reductions in the number of beds to allow for better infection control during Covid-19, as well as “the necessity to improve compliance with Hiqa standards”, she said.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney Collins PhotosBefore the end of the month – possibly as early as next week – a delicate dance between negotiating teams from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) and the Department of Public Expenditure will begin.Then they will assemble across the table from one another to start talks towards another pay deal for the 350,000 people who work in the public sector, but this time in a climate of inflation. Insiders hope the meeting can take place, for the first time in a long time, in person, probably in the department’s Merrion Street headquarters. The two sides are “not yet at the stage” where they must meet on neutral ground, jokes one.The State side will be led by Colin Menton, an assistant secretary in the Department of Public Expenditure, whose team “mark” various government departments and other parts of the public service. The union team is headed by Ictu president and chair of its public services committee Kevin Callinan – a brother, as it happens, of the newly-appointed secretary general of the Department of the Taoiseach and the most powerful civil servant in the country John Callinan. The brothers Callinan will not come across one another in the negotiations, but the public services committee of Ictu and the public service pay and pension ision of Department of Public Expenditure are not strangers to one another. They have thrashed out many pay agreements in the past. What is certain is that they have rarely squared off against one another in such uncertain and unpredictable circumstances. Agreement is possible rather than probable, and failure to strike a deal would result in a series of pay claims and – most likely – industrial disputes across the public sector.It is not yet clear whether the discussions will focus on a new agreement or an extension to the current deal. That runs until the end of this year, with a further 1 per cent increase for all public sector workers due in October. The unions wrote to the Department of Public Expenditure a fortnight ago, triggering a clause in the existing agreement that allowed either side to reopen it if external circumstances changed dramatically. Initially this was inserted at the behest of the State side, seeking to cover itself in the event of a sudden deterioration in the public finances, but the unions insisted that it work both ways.Either way the State side recognises and agrees with the union’s central contention: that the surge in inflation means the current deal must, in fairness, be revisited. IncreasesBut that’s where agreement, for now, ends. The Minister for Public Expenditure, Michael McGrath, has told officials to meet with unions, inspect their asks, and report back.It’s odds on they will. But whether agreement can be reached is anyone’s guess. Unions want a meaningful increases for their members, now facing an inflation rate running at a 20-year high. The Government side acknowledges some response is necessary, but pooh-poohs the idea of inflation-matching pay increases. “Forget it,” says one high-ranking source.Every 1 per cent on the public pay bill costs about €250 million no Minister for Public Expenditure or Minister for Finance will sign up to a deal costing billions. They’ll take their chances with industrial disputes rather than that.This week McGrath has signalled that he is interested in a deal – either an extension of the existing deal, perhaps superseding its autumn pay rise with something more substantial, or a new agreement. But with inflation running rampant and the international environment unprecedentedly uncertain, McGrath favour a short-term deal perhaps for a year. Something to tide everyone over until things settle down. “It’s completely understandable that there would need to be some adjustments,” says Sebastian Barnes, chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Government’s independent budgetary watchdog.But he warns: “We don’t want to stimulate second round effects and prompt an inflationary wage spiral. We can’t just pay ourselves more because costs have gone up. The Government needs to strike a balance.”Barnes says that the Government has some leeway to act because the public finances have recovered “really strongly” after Covid. He sees the case for temporary measures to deal with cost of living pressures, but counsels caution on permanent measures, such as wage increases. Public financesUCC economics lecturer Seamus Coffey agrees that the surge in inflation has piled pressure on the Government to act on wages. He agrees with Barnes that there is scope in the public finances to agree a new deal – “it’s a pretty reasonable request,” he says.However, he also points out that inflation also pushes up tax receipts, helping pay for any new deal.Both union and Government sides talk up the desirability of a deal – but also the difficulty in achieving it. Union meetings are calling for pay rises to match inflation – a goal that authoritative Government sources flatly say is unachievable. More realistically, sources involved in the process bat around questions like: could the State afford 3-4 per cent in a one-year deal? And would the unions be able sell that to their membership? The answer to neither question is clear.The negotiations will reopen, as they always do, the fissures between the public and private sectors. Private sector workers in successful companies, with well-paid jobs, or those whose employers have either offered or signalled inflation-tackling pay agreements (Bank of Ireland has just offered 7.5 per cent over two years, for example) might not pay much attention. But those in struggling companies, in small and medium enterprises, the self-employed small businesspeople and those in the battered service and hospitality industries, they will wonder why their taxes are being used to stretch the already hefty public sector premium that their counterparts who are employed by the State enjoy. Though there is much political focus on the high salaries paid to some officials in the public sector, the principal difference between public and private is that there is a much greater range of salaries in the private sector – there are more high earners, and more low earners. In the public sector those at the very top earn less, and those at the bottom earn moreRates of payWhen it comes to average rates of pay it’s a fact of life that public sector workers are better paid than their private sector counterparts even before their guaranteed pension – unavailable to almost all workers in the private sector – and job security is taken into account. Unions say that the State should be a “good employer”, which pays its workers well and treats them fairly. The State is also, by definition, a large enterprise, and larger employers tend to pay better, on average. Studies also show that there is a pay premium for workforces that are represented by trade unions, and the public sector is almost entirely unionised. The public sector unions, of course, are one of the strongest political lobbies in the country. Within the public sector CSO numbers suggest that gardai are the best paid workers on average, earning over €1,300 a week. The next best paid are workers in education, earning on average over €1,000 a week. Education workers are the best paid in the entire economy when judged by hourly rates, the CSO says, earning €38.50 an hour in the last quarter of 2021. Of course many teachers work outside their allocated hours, both preparing lessons and doing voluntary activities such as school sports and other after-school activities. The long school holidays also skew the teachers’ hourly rates a bit – then again during the long school holidays, the teachers are, well, on holidays. The arguments about public and private sectors are perennial, with both sides claiming that all they want is fairness. That concept means different things to different people, though, and will be of limited use in the horsetrading to come. Both sides believe that a deal is in everyone’s interests – but only if done on terms acceptable to them.

Photograph: iStockThe managing director of a Wexford radio station has described as “staggering” a suggestion by Wexford County Council that it agree its presenters would not express personal opinions on air in return for the council taking out advertising on the station.The suggestion is one of a number made by the county secretary, David Minogue, in an email to the managing director of South East Radio, Eamonn Buttle, during discussions over a proposed €40,000-€50,000 spend this year by the council on advertising with the station.In January the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) issued a report in which it criticised Tom Enright, chief executive of Wexford County Council, for putting “unwarranted” pressure on South East Radio during a 2019 row about coverage of the council by the station, and in particular by one of its presenters, local businessman Karl Fitzpatrick.By threatening to withdraw council advertising from the station during the row, Sipo said, Enright had breached the provisions of the Local Government Act and failed to maintain proper standards of integrity.The public ethics body said Enright had wrongly conflated the issue of his dispute with the station over its coverage of the council, and the council’s commercial position as the station’s primary advertiser.The Sipo report was discussed by a special meeting of the council in January, during which councillors criticised the public ethics body before voting to take no action on foot of its report. The councillors then gave the county manager a standing ovation.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he did not agree, and that others would take note of Sipo’s findings. The findings would have “far-reaching impacts” on the future behaviour of councils.“There cannot be any attempts to influence the content of any local radio discussion, debate or its treatment or coverage of any issue,” he said.“Even if there are advertisements that emanate from the council and so on, that is not correct. It can never be used for that purpose by anybody. I am very clear about that.”Fresh rowHowever, a row centred on exactly the same topic has again developed between Wexford County Council and South East Radio, with the station this time objecting strongly to “criteria” that the county secretary, Minogue, suggested should be agreed by the station as part of a deal over a proposed spend of €40,000-€50,000 on radio advertisements this year.In an email sent to Buttle on March 25th, Minogue said the council “does not consider it appropriate that a South East Radio broadcaster offers personal viewpoints and opinions on South East Radio.“I ask for assurances that South East Radio will take the steps necessary to ensure such personal views and opinions are not offered by your broadcasters in the future.”The council executive also suggested that the station ensure that “raw” material, meaning recorded material not broadcast by the station, be kept for a period of two years.A third criterion suggested by Minogue concerned what would happen when the council sought a right of reply in relation to something that had been broadcast by the station.“I ask that the matter end there, and that the original theme or issue is not raised again on South East Radio, as has happened previously.”In his response on April 1st, Buttle described what was being suggested as “frankly speaking, staggering” and said it was “absolutely necessary” to remind Minogue, and the council, of some very important recent events.“I find it very strange indeed that it is necessary for me to do so, given the gravity of those events. But the content of your email is so utterly devoid of any insight or learning from the Sipo investigation that I feel I must spell out some fundamental facts.”It was remarkable, he said, that Minogue’s email set out to follow the same course as that followed by county manager Enright in 2019.Buttle quoted the comments made in the Dáil by the Taoiseach in February, saying Martin had made his position “abundantly clear in relation to the kind of influence and misuse of power which your email of March 25th seeks to exert”.‘Profound criticism’Despite the “profound criticism” that Sipo had made of Enright, and the fact that a separate complaint by the council about South East Radio to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland had been “rejected entirely”, the station had received no apology from the county manager or the council, Buttle said.He said he was forced to the conclusion that the criteria the council were seeking to impose were a “form of retaliation for, and a direct result of” the Sipo complaint that had been submitted by Fitzpatrick, and upheld in the Sipo report in January.Buttle said the regulator for radio stations was the Broadcasting Authority, and it was not appropriate for the council to seek to set itself up as a quasi-regulator.Minogue and the council appeared to “fundamentally misunderstand the role of a local authority vis a vis local (or indeed national) media in a democratic society”, Buttle said, before quoting from article 40.6 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of expression.The council, Buttle said, was seeking to restrict open debate and public discourse in relation to the activities of the local authority within which South East Radio operates.“In a democratic society, such behaviour cannot and must not be tolerated. South East Radio certainly will not stand for it.”‘Really disappointed’He said the broadcaster was reserving its position in relation to the county secretary’s email.Minogue told The  that he was “really disappointed” by Buttle’s response. He said he felt it was “not appropriate” given the “reasonable” requests that had been made to the station.The county secretary is the council’s Ethics Registrar for the purpose of complaints made about the council under the Local Government Act. He said he was not aware of any fresh complaints having been made against the council in relation to South East Radio.Buttle did not respond to a request for a comment. Following the council meeting in January, when councillors voted to take no action on foot of the Sipo report, Enright issued a statement in which he said “we intend to look to put a service level agreement in place with South East Radio to facilitate an improved relationship in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"angela merkel doesnt deserve quiet retirement","story":"She was hailed as the world’s most powerful woman, the de facto leader of Europe and, for a while, of the free world. For 16 years Angela Merkel’s popularity in her native Germany never fell below 50 per cent. For those who put their faith in the EU, she could do no wrong.Then, when Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, her reputation collapsed. Now her legacy lies in ruins. It is rather difficult to find a Western politician whose status has fallen off a cliff quite like Merkel’s. Ukrainians blame her for appeasing Putin and leaving them at his mercy. They recall the 2008 Bucharest summit, when George W. Bush wanted to offer Ukraine Nato membership but the Germans and French vetoed it.As the full horror of the Russian occupation emerged, Volodymyr Zelensky could not contain his wrath: “I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha, to see what the policy of 14 years of concessions has led to. The Ukrainian president called on her and the former French president “to see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women”.Even now, Angela Merkel apparently has no regrets. Her office issued a terse statement: “Former German Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel stands by her decisions in connection with the 2008 Nato summit in Bucharest.” She refuses to apologise, then, for any of the policies that have led Germany and Europe to catastrophe. Instead, Mrs Merkel is writing her memoirs, convinced that history will somehow vindicate her. Once it was fashionable to compare her with Margaret Thatcher. Yet her approach was the opposite of the Iron Lady’s. Where Mrs Thatcher stood up to tyrants, Mrs Merkel sought to accommodate them, in the naive belief that prosperity would rid Russia and China of their authoritarian regimes. Germans used to call her Mutti (“Mummy”). Not any more. Mrs Merkel is the kind of mother who, when her child is bullied and beaten up at school, refuses to confront the teachers and instead blames the victim.Her admirers used to boast that she enjoyed a uniquely honest relationship with Putin, because she could talk frankly to the Russian dictator in his own language. Yet the truth is that Mrs Merkel, the former East German, feared the former KGB thug – and he smelled her fear. In later years, they spoke only in German, enabling Putin to hold the whip hand.From the outset, there was something sadomasochistic about their relationship. When she was his guest in 2007, Putin brought his pet labrador Connie to one of their meetings, knowing that she was nervous of dogs. Yet she played along with his blatant misogyny and fell into all the geopolitical traps he had laid for her.The biggest of these traps was her decision to allow Germany to become ever more dependent on Russian energy. By the time she left office last year, Germany was importing 55 per cent of its gas, 34 per cent of its oil and 52 per cent of its coal from Russia. Her short-termist, opportunistic exit from nuclear power compounded this. Worst of all was Mrs Merkel’s stubborn support for the deeply sinister Nordstream gas pipeline project, which flew in the face of Anglo-American warnings and desperate pleas from Ukraine. She turned a blind eye to the fact that Nordstream’s chairman – her predecessor as Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder – was being bankrolled by Russian energy. Nordstream had all the hallmarks of political interference, but she insisted that it was purely commercial.Mrs Merkel is no less culpable for her failure to maintain German defences. On her watch, in the words of the Bundeswehr’s most senior general, they were “stripped bare”. She allowed German firms to sell “dual use” military equipment to Russia, but banned arms exports to Ukraine.After Putin annexed Crimea and sent his “little green men” into Ukraine’s Donbas region, the writing was on the wall. Yet Mrs Merkel persisted in “building bridges” to Russia right up to the day she left office last December. Her most senior colleagues, such as the former finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble and the former foreign minister, now President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, have admitted that it was a fatal mistake to trust the Russian president. “Today I know — I was wrong,” Schäuble says. “We were all wrong.”Not Mrs Merkel, though. She, the chief architect of the European policies that gave Putin the green light to inflict war crimes on Ukraine, has yet to show any hint of contrition. It is high time that Angela Merkel said sorry to Ukraine, Europe and the free world. She owes us all an apology.More from NewsFrench election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Russia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky claims audio recordings are evidence of war crimesJess Phillips: ‘No trans person I’ve met has said we can’t say “woman”’Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Where will Ukraine be in a year?

Spies in the Foreign Office and Downing Street, where some of her pictures had raised eyebrows, tell me there has been a deliberate shift in her communications strategy.“They’re aiming to have more photos of her working with people,” says one mole. This was triggered in particular by a photo of the Foreign Secretary astride a Triumph motorbike in Thailand, one of the more egregious examples of Ms Truss enthusiastically emulating Mrs Thatcher.Viewers of Gardeners’ World were devastated last year when Nigel, presenter Monty Don’s beloved golden retriever and a regular screen presence, died. There were then worries when Patti the Yorkshire Terrier, Nigel’s replacement, went missing from the show earlier this year, with many concerned that Monty had been doubly bereaved.I am delighted to reveal that the story has a happy ending. Patti was spooked when one of the camera rigs nearly fell on her during filming and refused to go anywhere near them (unless being cuddled by Monty) since.

Palace sources say she made the decision a week in advance in order to avoid arrangements for the service being thrown into upheaval.The annual event is an important fixture in the royal calendar and will see Charles follow the ancient tradition of distributing Maundy money to leading members of the community on Thursday.It is understood the Queen, who has been experiencing mobility problems, was unable to commit to the event and, with the order of service being printed, was keen for the arrangements to be confirmed to avoid the day being overshadowed.A palace source said: Mobility issues which emerge make it difficult for the Queen to predict in advance whether she can attend a particular event. If an event requires advance notice for the printing of orders of service and other material, such as Royal Maundy, that makes it much harder.She felt it would be best to make it clear at this stage that she would not be attending, in order not to overshadow the service by pulling out closer to the time.The monarch attended the service commemorating the life of the Duke of Edinburgh last month and has been carrying out virtual events and her other duties as head of state.She was forced to miss November\u0027s Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in London after spraining her back. The service would have been her first duty in public after her hospital stay the previous month, when she underwent a series of checks.The Queen has been present for all but four Royal Maundy services of her reign. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother stepped in to represent her in 1960 because Prince Andrew was only a few weeks old.Four years later Princess Mary, Princess Royal, stood in for the Queen because Prince Edward had just been born.She was also absent twice while visiting other parts of the Commonwealth, most recently in 1970. She first attended Royal Maundy as Princess Elizabeth of York in 1935.The Queen has been present for all but four Royal Maundy services in her reign. She was absent twice following childbirth, and twice because she was visiting other parts of the Commonwealth. She first attended Royal Maundy as Princess Elizabeth of York in 1935.Charles and Camilla will join the congregation for the Royal Maundy service. The Queen will have been reluctant to cancel her appearance at the service, which she regards as an important element of her ceremonial and religious duties. It is the only occasion on which she visits others to make awards rather than the recipients of honours coming to her.Recipients of Maundy money were traditionally chosen for their poverty and were entitled to the payments for life. Today, new recipients are chosen each year on the recommendation of clergymen of various Christian denominations for their service to their churches or communities.During the service, which commemorates Jesus washing the feet of the Apostles at the Last Supper, the Queen traditionally distributes gifts according to the number of years she has lived. Because of the pandemic, last year\u0027s Maundy money was blessed at the Chapel Royal, St James\u0027s Palace, before being posted to recipients alongside a letter from the Queen.More from NewsFrench election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Russia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky claims audio recordings are evidence of war crimesJess Phillips: ‘No trans person I’ve met has said we can’t say “woman”’Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Where will Ukraine be in a year?

In Britain, it took until the mid-Seventies for wide-ranging protections to be put in place to prevent discrimination on the grounds of sex and race. Disability discrimination legislation did not arrive for another 20 years after that, with the Gender Recognition Act following in 2004.The 2010 Equality Act brought together all the different protected groups, whose rights had been hard-won over the centuries, under a single piece of landmark legislation. As regulator of that Act, our mission at the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is to uphold these protections.With nine different protected characteristics to consider, each with their own interests and needs, it is inevitable there will be occasions where some rights overlap. It is the EHRC’s role to balance those. One such example is the provision of single-sex spaces. The law is clear that organisations can sometimes limit access to their services to one sex, just as it is clear that trans people have the right to live their lives free of discrimination in the gender they identify with.To judge by the often toxic tone of debate in the media or online, you would be led to believe the public are polarised on this topic. In reality, focus groups and opinion polls show there are more areas where we agree than disagree. The British people, with a characteristic sense of fair play, understand this is a complex issue and that each situation requires a balanced approach and careful consideration.At the same time, we recognise this is a sensitive area to navigate. with real impact on people’s lives. So the EHRC has this week published practical guidance to assist providers of single-sex services.This is not an intervention on the wider debate about sex and gender identity, but an effort to help organisations such as sports clubs, women’s refuges and rape crisis centres to understand exactly what the Equality Act says. It will also help employers and businesses, who want to know they are providing toilets and changing facilities for their staff and visitors appropriately.We do not make the law, but it is our regulatory function to uphold it, independent of government, campaign groups or vested interests.The Act confirms that, while you must not discriminate against someone due to their protected characteristics, there are exceptions which allow organisations to limit services to a certain group, provided the reasons are justified. The reasons could be for privacy, decency, to prevent trauma or to ensure health and safety.Equally, it can be perfectly legal and appropriate for organisations to open their services to all groups. Our guidance urges service providers to adopt flexible policies that balance the needs of all users, based on their specific circumstances. This is the best way to ensure that women, girls and trans people are all treated fairly. Occasionally, competing rights need not mean conflict.Issues of sex and gender identity have dominated discussion since my appointment as EHRC chairman in Dec 2020. But there are still so many other areas where the scourge of discrimination persists and debates can be polarised. Last week, we launched a three-year strategy to tackle some of these, including discriminatory practices in the use of artificial intelligence, fair access to education and healthcare post-Covid, and relationships between different communities.I am therefore urging people, whatever their sincerely held views, to lower the temperature of debate and work constructively with us to achieve a fairer society for all.Baroness Falkner of Margravine is the chairman of the Equality and Human Rights CommissionMore from NewsFrench election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Russia-Ukraine latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky claims audio recordings are evidence of war crimesJess Phillips: ‘No trans person I’ve met has said we can’t say “woman”’Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Where will Ukraine be in a year?

Lord Pickles, who led a crackdown on “red tape” while in charge of the housing department from  to , admitted ministers should have acted more on warnings before the blaze during two days of questioning. But on his second day he snapped to lead counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett QC: By all means sir, feel free to ask me as many questions as you like. “But could I respectfully remind you that you did promise that we would be away this morning and I have changed my schedules to fit this in. I do have an extremely busy day meeting people. But this is more important than anything - but I would urge you to use your time wisely.  Lord Pickles later apologised for “any way I seemed discourteous”, adding: “As soon as I left the room I took the decision to cancel everything. “This is more important than anything I’m doing and I apologise… I fully understand that you’re doing a proper job.” But at the end of his evidence, he tripped up separately - appearing to mistake the death toll for that of Hillsborough, which until recently was . The toll from the  football ground disaster rose to  last year after a coroner’s ruling on the death of fan Andrew Devine. Lord Pickles referred to coroneraposs recommendations after the  Lakanal House fire in south London, which killed six people and injured  more. The first report from the Grenfell Inquiry found lessons from Lakanal fire had not been learned by the time of the Grenfell disaster eight years later.  He said: “It comes down to Michelleand to the nameless  people who were killed in the Grenfell fire. Itaposs them who we should think about when weaposre arguing the toss. Ultimately, as Iaposve said earlier, the dead deserve the dignity of being remembered by name and the dead deserve the dignity of a solution.”Lord Pickles was also chairman of the Conservative Party from  to .He made the mistake at the end of his evidence while answeringthere was anything he would have done dferently. After Lakanal, he said, “maybe I should have put in the letter the simple sentence aposand I accept the coroneraposs recommendationsapos - would that have changed things ”. But he added: “I donapost think it would have made any dference whatsoever.  There was a kind of mindset that existed in parts of the department that just simply ignored what was happening, made a view about what we were and came to it. Askedthe department should have “done more” to take on the lessons from Lakanal he replied: “Oh, definitely”. He added it was a personal failing on his part, “on the basis that I’m responsible for everything. The fact that I didn’t know about it, that no one briefed me… is no reasonable excuse, because ultimately it is always my fault.” But he also slammed firms that used flammable cladding, saying: “The conditions existed that there were people putting things in, into  and the like, that were combustible. “The idea to me is: how would anybody ever want to do that  How would they ever think it was a good idea ” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Eric PicklesConservative PartyPublic inquiryRed tapePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That is down by , since the , in the week ending  February . Rail services are battling Covid absences and a funding crisis - as there are still only % as many passengers travelling as pre-pandemic, the data shows.

And despite fares rising .% last month, services are still being cut to save cash. More cuts are planned in Yorkshire next month - leaving a two-hour, ten-minute gap between the .pm and .pm service from Leeds to Harrogate.  Labour, which obtained the leaked Rail Delivery Group data, blasted the figures just months after Tory ministers vowed to “protect and improve services” in the Integrated Rail Plan.Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “The Conservatives should come clean and admit they are taking the axe to vital rail services across the country. “This is the exact opposite of what the Conservatives promised, and will hit communities hard. “To add insult to injury, last month they clobbered passengers with another brutal fare hike.” The Rail Delivery Group said it was “only sensible” that services reflect the “new world” of passenger numbers that have “changed radically with the pandemic”, “so that the railway doesn’t take more than its fair share from the taxpayer”. Askedservices would ever get back to what they were in early , a spokesperson said: “Nothing is set in stone and we will continually monitor how passengersand look to step up services where there is enough demand from passengers.”  It comes days after local leaders said they were “shafted” by Boris Johnson’s bus funding which went to fewer than half of eligible areas. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The railways experienced an unprecedented fall in passenger numbers during the pandemic. “Not adjusting rail services would have been irresponsible and unfair on those taxpayers’ forced to foot the bill – many of whom do not use the railways. “Instead, this Government committed almost £bn to ensure vital services continued to run and key workers were able to keep using them. “Whilst passengers are ing, it is important to ensure service levels reflect demand, which is still % less than in , and we will keep working with operators to do so.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyDepartment for TransportBoris JohnsonRailwaysSave moneyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Manager Karen Noble is on a mission to make sure people are getting the support and benefits they need – and this is particularly important for older visitors, who might feel isolated. “It’s not just about organising activities they can get involved with: conversations might come out of that,” says Karen. “People will tell you what they’re struggling with and how you can support them. You might find out that they’ve been given an iPad but have no internet connection, or that they don’t feel safe because some kids have been throwing eggs in the streets. “We have a lot of older people who shouldbe receiving benefits but they’re not. So we want to get that message out to them. They’ll go ‘No, I’m alright’ because there is a bit of pride there – but we want to make sure they get everything they’re entitled to.”Karen is devoted to helping people in the local community because she knows what it’s like to struggle.

Heather Wilhelm-Routenberg and her we Robinsought out a fertility clinic in New York to have embryos implanted - and had used the process of gender selection to ensure they had a girl. Speaking to the New York Post, the couple explained they chose to use Robbieaposs egg and donor sperm to create the embryo, which was implanted into Heatheraposs womb. But after growing attached to their baby girl in the womb, who they thought would be a tiny Robbie, they received a shock when they went for a -week scan. As the sonographer checked the gender of the baby, she explained the couple were having a boy. “Our jaws dropped to the floor. I was convinced it had to be someone ’s result, Heather said.  The pair then became convinced Heather had been implanted with someone aposs embryo - with Heather describing it as like having an alien inside her. The couple booked in for a second scan the following day which confirmed Heather was carrying a boy and the clinic began an investigation to find outthe embryo belonged to the couple at all. Heather and Robbie were then subject to a painful seven week wait while the investigation was underway - during which time Heather admitted she had no connection to the baby growing inside her, because she didnapost knowit was hers. But when it was confirmed the embryo belonged to the couple, they felt a sense of deep betrayal. Heather said: We had a healthy baby, but I had no emotional connection and now I had to wrap my head around having a child forever that I wasn’t planning on.She added she hated the idea of not being able to connect with the baby inside her and described the pregnancy as a terrible experience.When he was born in December , she struggled to breastfeed him and began to suffer severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts - and was eventually diagnosed with complex postnatal depression. Heather stressed she didnapost want to sound ungrateful as now their -month-old son is full of magic. However the couple have decided to sue their fertility clinic for the error, citing medical malpractice and battery. While Heather is now recovering from postnatal depression, she says she feels immense guilt and shame over not being able to bond with him in the early months of his le. She said: “He’s an innocent being, he didn’t deserve any of this. The clinic messed with something so integral: our baby’s first formative years. That’s the reason I am doing this – because I love my kid so much.

Faith Hindle, , was found hanged at her family home and was rushed to Royal Manchester Hospital, but medics were unable to save her from dying.An inquest at Bolton Coroneraposs Court was told her family, school and GP had helped her access mental health support in the months before her death.In August , two referrals were made to Salford Children and Adolescent Mental Health Serviceafter Faith attempted suicide, Manchester Evening News reported.Faith was seen by the Salford Mental Health Liaison Team on September  when she took an overdose at school. Tayaba Nicholson, a mental health practitioner at Salford CAMHS, picked up her referral and they regularly met over the coming months.  The hearing heard how during their telephone appointment on December  Faith told Ms Nicholson she was experiencing daily suicidal thoughts and felt “unable” to keep herself safe. Faith’s parents were not informed and she told the hearing she had a “very heavy caseload at the time.

Rows of marquees have been set up, guard dogs are patrolling and I bet there’ll be all kinds of posh frocks and fancy food.Our Robert always liked David as the pair were both in Manchester United’s Class of . My late husband Colin enjoyed chatting to his mum and dad - they seem lovely people. For the Beckhams and Brooklyn’s we to be, money is no object so it’s probably normal for them to spend so much money on a wedding. But for me, vows are always the most important thing in a wedding. When you can really feel the couple’s love and pick up a sense of everyone in the room wishing them them a happy le, that’s what makes a cracking wedding - not the size of the ice sculpture or amount of champagne on tap. Weddings always take me back to me and Colin’s big day, when I wore a mini dress with a floppy hat because it was the days of Mary Quant style. Colin wore a brown suit and kipper tie which he insisted was green and I joked he was colourblind. The years would prove that he actually was, and I still have no idea how he was able to play snooker. We had our reception in a room above a pub across the road from my parents’ house. Everyone there knew us since we were knee high and, until the days my two sons were born, it was the happiest day of my le. Our first night as husband and we was spent in my aunt’s flat in Wrexham. But guests had sneaked in before us and as soon as we pulled the bedsheets back, we found long lines of apples all strung together. Attending a wedding feels like a little holiday, when you wear your Sunday best and have a night in a hotel. And there’s always one highlight I always look forward to: the food. I wish the photographs would hurry up so we could get the pate out. I learned over the years to keep a little packet of KP nuts in my handbag at weddings. When I ask everyone at the tablethey’d like some nuts from the bar they always refuse. But when I offer mine around but they never refuse. They’re only small bags so by the time it comes back to me there are about three nuts at the bottom. So here’s wishing Brooklyn Beckham all the best. And to the VIP guests: don’t forget your peanuts. Why Wrexham is greatest placeWrexham is on the shortlist to be named Britain’s city of culture .I can’t understand why. If judges visit now, they’ll find most of the shops boarded up and only pound or charity shops left. It used to be a pretty market town but it’s gone to pot. Yet it doesn’t matter that it might not look the most picturesque place. Becausethe judges care to scratch the surface of Wrexham and really get to know the people here, I’ve no doubt they’ll adore the place as much as I do. No one here can be doing with people who are all fur coat and no knickers. We don’t all come together in a snooty cafe to talk about books - we meet at the football ground each weekend. And everyone here looks out for each other. My friend Rob has called to cut my lawn ever since I lost Colin ten years ago, and this week he brought his we Sonia along so we could chat while he worked.  Not long after they’d gone, Rob rang my doorbell to deliver me a plated up dinner of liver and onions, which I’d mentioned was my favourite. He said: “Sonia noticed you were bad on your legs and have been eating ready meals because you can’t stand at the oven long.” Such kindness made me fill up. And I felt the same when a man rushed out of the GP surgery when they saw me struggle to get out of Janet’s car to offer his arm and say: “Can you manage, darling ” Wrexham is a place where everyone’s welcome, where kids’ bikes can be left unchained outside and everyone says hello and would have a good old chatyou have time. That’s the essence of Wrexham and its people. And that’s why, for me, it’s the best place on earth whether we win city of culture or not. Ender an era for soaps News of June Brown’s death really moved me. Even though I stopped watching EastEnders years ago, I loved Dot Cotton with her fag dangling out the side of her mouth. Brilliant actors like June made soap operas a hit because they created real characters. June and I share a le outlook: there’s no point worrying about tomorrow because we mightn’t be alive, so we might as well enjoy today.  Iaposll give Chris some stick On our Robert’s Radio  Live show, Chris Sutton loves winding him up. Chris assumed Scotland would qualy in World Cup games to play England, even though Wales has just as good a chance. The patriotic side of me came roaring out like a dragon. So I told Rob to tell Chris thathe makes fun of Wales again, I’ll have to shove my walking stick where the sun don’t shine. Will was silly...Iaposd have got to him backstage I am still stunned Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars. Demonstrating violence in front of a global audience was utterly wrong. If I’d been in the theatre and someone made a hurtful remark against a member of my family, I’d have waited until I was backstage and said: “Excuse me, what you said was not nice at all.” Then I’d have smacked him.  *******I might be the only person in the world who doesn’t have a smart-arse phone. And I’ve no intention of buying one. I have an old fashioned mobile which can text and make calls and that’s it.The clock still shows an hour behind and I wouldn’t bother altering it evenI knew how. I appreciate anything that makes me feel even a little bit younger. If you’d like to contact Val, email features@mirror or write to Val Savage, PO Box , E DD.

Thereaposs no set level for when a bereaved family needs to go through probate, but itaposs usually for larger estates involving multiple assets. For Sharleneaposs estate, this would be unnecessary. Sharleneaposs mum, Karen Gaze, said: She died suddenly and unexpectedly on December  from a cardiac arrest. Her brother, Paul, found her and tried to resuscitate her. We are all devastated. We later learned she had a heart condition she wasnapost aware of. She was supposed to be taking Tyler on holiday on June  to celebrate Tyleraposs th birthday. Sharlene was always a forward-thinker and she would pay a bit towards the holiday every month so that she could pay for it all in advance. She had paid about £ of the £, for the two of them. The trip to Kos was for Sharlene, Tyler, Sharleneaposs sister Sammi and Sammiaposs two daughters. Karen said there was nothing in the small print of the payment plan to suggest it would be so hard to get a refund upon Sharleneaposs death. She said: Jet are very sympathetic on the phone and very nice about it, but they are telling me I must have an executor for Shareleneaposs estate, which my solicitor says is just completely unnecessary and will cost about £. The money is for Tyler and we want him to have it but all heaposs going to get is £ once weaposve paid to appoint the executor. Itaposs so annoying because weaposve set up an account for the money Sharlene did have to go into and the banks have let us get the money. But this money is for Sharleneaposs poor son and Jet are digging their heels in. Iaposve sent the death certicate and even her birth certicate to prove that Iaposm her mum. But theyaposll only send the money to the executor of her estate. Itaposs been hard for Tyler - heaposs only  and heaposs got his GCSEs coming up. Heaposs being very strong but itaposs been hard, emotionally, for us all. I just donapost want to be arguing anymore. Explaining that lying would have been easier, she said: Ironically, I could have just phoned pretending to be Sharlene and asked to cancel and they would have given me a full refund. But I decided to be honest instead. Jet confirmed they were not going to make exceptions to the rules for Karen. They said in a statement: “We would like to extend our sincere condolences to Ms Gaze and her family at this dficult time. As the account used to make the original booking has been closed, we cannot refund that account. As such, we have requested for Ms Gaze to provide documentation showing her to be the named executor of her daughter’s estate so that we can refund her directly. As we have not received this proof of authority, we are unfortunately unable to do this. We sincerely hope to be able to complete the refund once this proof of authority is confirmed, and we have been in touch with Ms Gaze to explain this.” The Mirror contacted Jet for a statement.

The research indicates people are also less likely to be admitted to hospital with the current dominant iant and that symptoms do not last as long in those who have been vaccinated than with Delta .The findings support previous studies that suggest the incubation time and period of infectiousness for Omicron is shorter than for previous coronavirus iants.The two Covid- symptoms that were consistently more prevalent in both iants – regardless of vaccination status – were a sore throat and hoarse voice, the Daily Record reports.Researchers also found that some of the more debilitating symptoms, such as brain fog, eye burning, dizziness, fever and headaches were signicantly less prevalent in Omicron cases.Dr Cristina Menni from King’s College London said: “We observe a dferent clinical presentation of symptoms in those infected with Omicron compared to Delta. “As we are moving even further away from the average patient having UK government ‘core’ symptoms ie fever, persistent cough, loss of smell, our results point to a dferent selection of symptoms that may indicate infection.  “To protect others, it is still important to self-isolate for five days as soon as you see any symptoms.” Professor Ana Valdes, an honorary professor at King’s College London, said: “Although there is still a wide range of duration and severity of symptoms with Omicron, for vaccinated iniduals we find on average a shorter duration of symptoms. “This suggests that the incubation time and period of infectiousness for Omicron may also be shorter.” Researchers from King’s College London and scientists from Zoe studied the symptoms of , vaccinated UK participants from the Zoe Covid Study App who tested positive between June  last year and November  , when Delta was dominant, and December   to January  this year when Omicron was dominant. The study will be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology  Infectious Diseasesthis month in Lisbon.

Adam Long, , battled heavy substance abuse and mental health issues for a number of years which he was fighting with the support of his family and local services. In October  he made his way to the London Underground where he jumped in front of a train and was killed, City of London Coronersapos Court heard.In a statement read by coroner Linda Jacobs, Mum Samantha called her son a “wonderful, funny, caring person”, My London reported.She added how the family had a meal to celebrate a birthday on September  when Adam was “cheerful and gave “no indication this was the last time he would see his family”. In a phone call to his mum the next day, Adam ended it with Bye, love you. The statement continued: “There was no sense of this being last phone call. “On the day prior to his death, I visited his flat. There was leftovers in the fridge waiting to be eaten, clothes drying on the clothes horse, indicating he intended to . “The issues that Adam developed were around feelings of rejection. In September , we got him a place at a residential rehabilitation. Family and friends tried to show him it was a good thing but he decided not to go.

Internal emails show the head of a medal committee agreeing to follow “lines to take” from “our compensation colleagues” and accepting bogus information about nuclear test veterans.He wrongly linked medals to the issue of whether servicemen were injured - in clear breach of the rules - and went on to refuse gongs for five dferent groups of ex-servicemen. Now there are calls for the committee to be scrapped, and medals to be awarded to all those it has rejected since it was formed four years ago. Plymouth MP Johnny Mercer, who as Veterans Minister repeatedly told Parliament the committee was independent, said it was time for politicians to intervene.He said: “I think ministers should interrogate that committee, and perhaps try to understand why they’re not getting medals. I don’t think there’s evidence I was misled, but I do not think that decision about nuclear veterans was right.” The emails were uncovered after a six-month Freedom of Information battle about the Advisory Military Sub Committee which considers medal claims. It was set up, following a Mirror campaign in , to consider a gong for nuclear veterans. The emails show an unnamed civil servant telling committee chairman Charles Winstanley: “I thought you might be interested to see the lines to take that our compensation colleagues use in response to the nuclear test veterans’ claims.”  It is understood compensation colleagues refers to either government lawyers, or officials in Veterans UK, part of the MoD which administers war pensions. Neither are supposed to have any influence on medal decisions. The email makes  claims about Britain’s nuclear tests, including that no men were used in experiments, they were well-monitored, and there is no “evidence of excess illness or mortality”. The government’s own studies show the opposite is true. Within minutes, Winstanley replies calling this “succinct and relevant”, adding it “may be useful in any response to PQs [parliamentary questions].” He went on to refuse a medal, on the grounds there was insufficient “risk and rigour” to the nuclear tests. In February, the Mirror revealed how the committee was formed of Establishment figures who had been given medals for tasks including running Whitehall budgets, organising the Invictus Games, and reintegrating the Taliban into Afghan society.  Since the committee was formed, it has rejected calls for a medal for nuclear veterans three times. On the latest occasion, in December last year, Dr Winstanley told the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association that it did not even consider half of a -page appeal, because it contained no new information. He added - in a claim directly contradicted by his personal emails - that the issue of health was not linked to the award of medals, and there was no reason to justy any change to that position. Laura Jackson, , of Cheltenham, was born blind in one eye, had a heart attack at , suffered repeated miscarriages, lost her teeth, and had three malignant cancers removed from her face. Read more She only found out her father Ron Owen had taken part in nuclear tests after he and her brother both died young of a heart condition linked to radiation. “Saying these men were only at riskthere is proof they were exposed, is like saying soldiers are only at risk of being shotthey have a bullet wound,” she said. “This committee never spoke to a veteran, never asked one of the men whoaposd served whether they felt there was risk or rigour to it. It was just a front for the lawyers, and has been corrupted by the MoD. It should be scrapped and never allowed to meet again.” Labour MP Rebecca Long-Bailey, who campaigns on behalf of nuclear test veterans, said: “It is undeniable that radiation presents a risk, and regardless of injury, the veterans’ service was of vital importance to this country. “Officials have spent  years denying the truth to these men and their families, and will clearly carry on doing so until the Prime Minister takes charge of the situation, looks these veterans in the eye, and makes amends for this national scandal.” The committee also denied a medal to ground crew who took part in the  Berlin airlt, a star for Bomber Command, and clasps for the British Expeditionary Force sent to France in , and those who gathered intelligence behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. A spokesman for the MoD said: “We provide secretariat support to the chairman of the independent Advisory Military Sub Committee so he can effectively fulfil his duties, under the instruction of the Cabinet Office.

Two kind-hearted nine-year-olds had found her card and brought it to her small cul-de-sac home toit to her. Hania Zawadzka and Amelia Maciak had figured out where she lived and they pushed a note through her door and once in the hope of finding the card’s owner.  Once the smart kids had confirmed it was Safrina’s card, they handed it back to her. The next day, the grateful -year-old went to the girl’s house to meet their proud mums Wioleta and Katarzyna.To show her appreciation she gave them a thank you gt which included easter eggs and a cash reward.She said: I went to work on that day and had taken my credit card out along with some other items and started my support worker job. I left the house at .pm and stopped at Morrisons to get petrol and I couldn’t find my credit card. It was a weird moment where you think to yourself I’m pretty sure I took it out with me but I didn’t think much of it, maybe I forgot to take it as I had other items that I brought out as well. I started work around .pm and I got a notication from my door bell from the girls at .pm and that’s when I had realised I had lost it.  The girls were sceptical at first and asked me details on my card which I confirmed and they posted it through my letterbox and I had asked where they lived and stated they lived just across the road from me about  yards away. I told them I would come and see them today or tomorrow when I’m free and thanked them. I had finished my tea calls around pm and wasn’t due out for bed calls until .pm and that’s when I put together the gts and went to their house and presented the gts. The impressed business owner explained why the small act of kindness was so special. The parents especially are happy and proud, I’ve made new friends and taught the girls values and morals of their good deeds. It’s always what I try to do with other kids to teach them right and wrong as kids are our future, she said. She continued:They all gave me a big hug and smiled. I had met the father on the day of giving them gts on the same day but I hadn’t met the mothers yet until yesterday, they were all there and invited me in for a coffee.

Instead of going on a contactless spending spree they both chapped on every single door in my neighbourhood until they found me, not only that, they were both asking me card details to make sure I was the rightful owner.

Peter Rhodes, , says he doesnapost play the lottery very often and only buys tickets when the winnings are bigMr Rhodes says alarm bells started ringing when he took his ticket to a shop in London and he alleges his National Lottery jackpot was stolen by a shop employee when he tried to cash in the ticket.The pensioner claims a woman in Camelotaposs operations team confirmed it was worth £.million but hours later he says he was contacted by the lottery firmaposs fraud team saying they will not pay out the winnings - because it had already been claimed. Mr Rhodes, from London, told The Mirror: Itaposs a le-changing amount of money. They havenapost stolen from me. They stole my kidaposs futures. That money was going to be for them. I turned  a couple of weeks ago and I never asked anything from anyone. Mr Rhodes says he took his ticket to a shop in London in October  and when the shopkeeper put it through the machine it allegedly made a noise to indicate he had won something.  He said things then became very strange and claims the shopkeeper refused to give his ticket over. Mr Rhodes said: When I first went in and handed it over the shopkeeper put it in the machine and it made a noise, meaning it was a winning ticket of some sort. I didnapost know how much was on it and he then refused to give me my ticket. I asked for my ticket back and he took three steps to the right and put it under the counter. I leaned over and saw he had about  tickets under the counter. He picked one up and paid me something like £.. He tried to say it was my ticket and it wasnapost. I know it wasnapost because I folded mine twice and put it in my wallet and this one was flat.Mystery surrounds the winnings, with the shop where Mr Rhodes went to cash it in not making a claim. Mr Rhodes said: I spoke with someone in operations [at Camelot] who went out of their way to find an electronic footprint to prove I had bought the ticket. I donapost buy tickets every week, I only ever bought tickets when it was a large jackpot. I had the bank print off the statement and she found the ticket through that - and that is when I learned it was a £.million ticket. Then I got a call from their fraud department saying they are shutting down the case because they wonapost pay out twice. In search of his winnings, Mr Rhodes contacted the police. He has hired a solicitor and plans to take his case against National Lottery as far as he can. He said: I was so frustrated because it was the start of lockdown and I went to the police and they told me it is a civil matter. If National Lottery really cared about changing peopleaposs lives - then they need to sit up and listen. They would have more respectthey came out and help shut down shopkeepers who do this. A politan Police spokesperson said: In May  police received a report of fraud relating to a lottery ticket purchased in October . This was initially dealt with as a civil matter. In September , following further contact from the complainant, officers liaised with Camelot who confirmed there was no evidence that any fraud had been committed. As a result, the case has been closed – should any further information come to light then this decision can be re-assessed. A Camelot spokesperson said: While we canapost comment on the specics of this case, weaposre aware that Mr Rhodes has now instructed solicitors and weaposll be responding fully to his solicitors in due course.

Think Ken Dodd, Les Dawson, Morecambe and Wise, Al Read, Hylda BakerVictoria Wood and Peter Kay.So are all the great inventors like George Stephenson who gave us railways, the top football teams and the best cricketers. It’s serious, too. As the great all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes said, “We doan’t play cricket in Yorkshire for foon”. If we have a chip on our shoulder – possibly both – it’s because southerners don’t appreciate us proper.  We don’t need to ask ourselves “are we northerners ” because we know already. But darn sarf they don’t know, and it’s about time somebody told ‘em. Writer Brian Groom seeks to do just that in Northerners: A History, a definitive new chronicle of the region, the first to appear this century. He starts with the question “Where is the North, and what is a Northerner ” And he ought to know, being a native of Stretford, Greater Manchester, who came back to live in Lancashire after decades of missionary work in London. In his view, the answer is simple: “The North is where people who live there think they are in the North”. And a Northerner is “someone who regards themself as a Northerner.” Really  So it’s not so much a place as a state of mind, an attitude even. And there’s more than enough of that around, say southerners - one of whom cracked the first “north of Watford” joke as long ago as .But being Northern must have started somewhere, sometime, among people. Groom traces our ancestors to a camp of ancient Britons near Scarborough in , BC. It later moved to Filey, but is now closed. The first great Northerner, Caramundia, Queen of the Brigantes, is not as famous as Boudicca, but she was better at doing deals for freedom with the Romans. In those days, England was ided into Britannia Inferior and Britannia Superior. Guess which was the North  Right first time, and nothing much has changed. There was a brief golden age under Bede and the monks of Lindisfarne, and then the Wars of the Roses devastated the North. This was a quarrel between rival branches of the Plantagenet family vying for the throne, not a battle between Lancashire and Yorkshire, argues historian Groom. Cricket fans may dispute his claim. The Industrial Revolution, born here around , confirmed the image of the North as a dirty, hard-working, direct, money-making place.  It was the engine of the nation’s growth, powered by pioneers like textile magnate Richard Arkwright, a barber and wig-maker from Preston, known as King Cotton, who created the factory system that dominated industry for a century. But behind the success story lay the misery of city slums, short, unhappy lives, a reliance on slave-trade cotton, the fruits of imperial expansion and armed trade – dubbed “war capitalism.” And the spectacular Victorian boom didn’t last. By , Britain had been overtaken by the USA. The revolution also gave impetus to the north-south ide. “Northerners saw themselves as independent, straight-talking, knowledgeable and practical,” writes Groom. “Southerners perceived northerners as truculent, lacking social graces, over-competitive and unsophisticated.” Recognise anybody here  It’s like looking in the mirror.Hang on - the great political forces of the age started here: the Independent Labour Party in Bradford and the Trades Union Congress. Northern women made an outstanding contribution. Social reformer Josephine Butler, the Bronte sisters, the militant suffragette movement led by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, and heroines like Grace Darling, -year-old rescuer of shipwrecked survivors in storm-tossed seas. The North created great cities: Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle where municipal socialism provided schools, housing, transport, water, gas and electricity. They were almost a state within a state. But they never achieved the political influence commensurate with their size, a situation that largely still holds true today. Northern -Mayors have the trappings of power, but little real clout, as Manchester’s Andy Burnham found during the pandemic. In the s, northern cities appeared to be “in terminal crisis” says Groom. There were riots in Liverpool, where unemployment soared to %, and Manchester. The North’s economy underperformed during the Cameron and May governments, and still does.Despite all the hot air about “levelling up”, the north-south chasm is still with us, like the poor. Will it ever vanish  “Can we ever be rid of the north-south ide, which casts the North as the back end of the English economy’s pantomime horse ” asks historian Groom. Thatcher claimed to have done so, asserting dogmatically after a trip to the region in : “The north-south ide has gone.” Only, perhaps, in the sense that she tried to abolish the industrial north. “Much as many would love to wish the North-South ide away, this is no time to give up,” says Groom. “If there is to be a revival, it will depend on the talents, energy and enterprise of northerners. “As for closing the cultural gap, does anyone really want to  Britain already has enough clone towns, surely,” he concludes.And enough clone accents, too. Northern students at Oxford were bullied for talking as they did at home, and northerners who migrated to “The Smoke” spent years trying to speak BBC English. That’s changed, but not totally. “Regional accents have become more accepted,” notes Groom, “though the south-east still dominates.” Reet there, son. Northerners was  years in the writing, and even longer in the evolution. Groom, former head of the regional reporting team of the Financial Times, travelled around the North in the fties with his father, the sales manager of a textile firm. He didn’t miss much. What kind of Northerner is he, I asked him. There was a brief, awkward silence, and then he replied “a pan-Northerner”. Translated, an all-and-everywhere Northerner, I suppose. Am I a Northener  My family originated in Bewcastle, on the Scottish borders , and came to Yorkshire at the turn of the th century by way of Allandale and Sunderland. Many more made the same kind of journey, from Ireland, Scotland, Wales and continental Europe, including Poles and Ukranians. Under the leaden skies that so often hang over us, we are all northerners now. Inevitably, it must be asked: Is there a comparable book about Southerners  No, and I think I know why. They don’t have, or seem to want, a similar sense of place and identity. And scraps, by the way, are scrunchy bits of batter left over from the fish frying process.

The woman, named Chelsa, posted a video on TikTok in which she said her lips were once so full of filler that her top lip split in the middle - and she joked she had ended up looking like she had Richmond sausages for lips.Chelsaaposs clip included a picture of herself after her lips had split, and while itaposs unclear when the photo was taken, she explained in the comments that things had gotten out of hand over the course of a few years. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The woman captioned the video: Richmond sausage lips.And in text included in the clip, which was posted under the username @xxchelsaxx, she added: When my lips were so full of filler they split and looked like a bum hole.”Chelsa then offered more insight into her lip disaster in the comments of the video, when she admitted the split was the result of having ml of fillers injected, when most people only have around ml in their lips at a time. However, the woman also stated she got to that stage after slowly increasing the amount of filler she had injected each time, as she told one commenter: It was a gradual build-up over about   years. And while Chelsa can poke fun at her lips now that she limits her injections, itaposs important to understand the risks of going to the extremes with filler, such as migration, which occurs when parts of the body are overfilled. You should always keep track of the amount of filler that will be put into your lips, as it can be easy to get carried away and lose sight of how big your lips might be getting. If youaposve ever had filler before, you should always let your practitioner knowyou already have some filler in your lips before you have more injected - as this will help them assess how much they should be giving you.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TikTokViralUmm what Beauty trends\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" for the Real Beauty newsletter and join our community of real people who test products in the real world - all for free!Sign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It will be her first trip outside the US since the couple quit the royal familyMeghan Markle and Prince Harry at the Invictus Games in  Image: XByRussell MyersRoyal Editor:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsMeghan Markle will travel with Prince Harry to the Invictus Games in Holland next week, on her first trip outside of the US since the couple quit the royal family. The Mirror can reveal Harry and Meghan will be followed by a Netflix documentary crew throughout the Games, which start next Saturday.The couple’s decision to attend the event in The Hague has been blasted by palace insiders after Harry claimed it was “too dangerous” to travel to the UK.He is locked in a legal battle with the UK government over a decision to downgrade his security, and did not show up at a memorial service for his grandfather, Prince Philip, last week. Ken Wharfe, an ex-Met officer who once protected Harry, said: “I’m baffled about why Harry thinks he would be safer in the Netherlands than the UK. “He would have travelled to his grandfather’s memorial service with his brother or father and received protection from the Met. It’s not like he would have been turning up at Westminster Abbey on a bike. “It is more of a risk to go to Holland to support a charity with a military link than coming to London last week.” A spokesman for Harry and Meghan reportedly said: “We take measures based on the security threat level.”  Since ditching their royal roles to seek “financial independence”, Meghan, , and Harry, , have signed deals with Netflix and Spoty worth more than £million. The couple, who now live in Calornia with children Archie, two, and -month-old Lilibet, are expected to arrive in Holland on Friday. Harry’s father Prince Charles is understood to have offered an olive branch to smooth relations, offering the Duke of Sussex and his family the opportunity to stay with him and we Camilla at Highgrove. But sources close to Charles suggest the invitation “remains unanswered”.  Meghan may join Harry on stage at the Games opening ceremony, insiders promising “a big surprise to launch the event”. A source said: “Meghan is excited to travel with Harry for the event, which is certainly close to his heart.” The couple’s Archewell Productions last April announced its first major docu-series for Netflix would be titled Heart of Invictus, and follow athletes and organisers from across the world on the road to the Games.

When officials encountered the zoo in Armenia, they found dozens of other animals, including a lioness and monkeys, in a ramshackle dark barn.Itaposs thought the owner rescued animals from traffickers and hunters, yet one UK charity toldThe Sunthat conditions were shocking and among the worst we’ve seen.Now the Armenian government is being pressurised to shut down the park entirely.  One especially tragic situation saw a blind bear, called Nelson, housed in a dirty cage, with no exercise room for three decades, with rotting teeth and poor eyesight, which could be salvaged with surgery. Campaigners also revealed that a -year-old lioness called Sara, had been trapped in a space equivalent to a garden shed for seven years. Thereaposs also a group of monkeys, captive in a rotting barn with no daylight, and an eagle who is unable to stretch its wings in a small cage. An Armenian goat constantly charges the bars of its ramshackle pen. An animal welfare bill, which would see the zoo closed down, is currently being debated. The UK-based International Animal Rescuehas been trying to save Nelson the bear, but the owner Armen Tadevosyan, , refuses to hand him over.  He claims his animals are well looked after at the zoo in Armavir, which is a small town  miles west of Armenia’s capital, Yerevan. IAR president, Alan Knight OBE, said: The conditions these poor animals are living in are nothing short of hell on earth. The cages are small, filthy and dilapidated to say the least, and the animals have no choice but to stand in the squalor with nothing to break their boredom and frustration.  The idea that members of the public would choose to pay money to see these captive animals suffering behind bars is just laughable. We’ve been trying to rescue the bear, who we called Nelson, for months now with no success, but clearly all the animals in so-called Salvation Park are in urgent need of proper care and attention. As an animal welfare organisation, we are ready and willing to help ensure they get it. IAR has a bear rescue centre in Armenia and has so far saved  animals.  Alan Knight added: It’s a stain on the international reputation of Armenia that it allows sentient creatures to suffer such cruelty and neglect. I urge the government to step in right away and force the closure of the park so that the animals can be given proper food and care for the first time in years. There is no excuse for such cruelty and neglect and I know there will be a public outcry when people read about it.Hopefully public pressure will persuade the government to close the park and start the animals on the road to a better, happierle.That is the only humane and compassionate course of action.

Kramatorsk train station,  miles east of us , was hit by missiles - one marked “For What Has Been Done To The Children,” killing at least , including five children, and injuring up to . President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Russians of “…lacking the strength and courage to face us on the battlefield and cynically destroying the civilian population.” Todayaposs depraved Kramatorsk shelling was matched by the horrors locals were revealing in communities north of Kyiv. In the blitzed village of Andriivka, north of Kyjv city, father-of-three Piotr Kachenko, , was sitting by the side of the road, amid the devastation. This quietly-spoken elderly man told us: “They ran into the basements of private homes, spraying them with bullets. It is unbelievable.“They came here and killed a lot of people , mostly young men, burning their faces when they were dead, after pouring petrol on them. “They had their hands tied and then they were taken into the fields and shot dead - then burned so that they cannot be recognised.” It seems everybody here knows someone who has disappeared in this field, where at least  young men were executed, their faces mutilated with petrol. Today his friend and neighbour Anton, , was buried, according to Piotr but he is confused and exhausted by the nightmare that descended upon his village. The Russians have gone now, retreating hastily north to Belarus or east to be re-deployed in the contested Donbas region, where Moscow is preparing a massive offensive.  But they have left behind a legacy of murder and depravity that is etched on the bullet-pock marked walls, blackened ruins of Ukraine’s communities and the faces of everyone we meet. A middle-aged lady called Tania, approaches us next to Piotr, crying that her house was marked “children” but that did not stop the Russians. Still shaking with fear she tells us: “There were nine of us hiding in the basement and we were trying to be quiet as the Russians came into my yard. “They opened the door of the cellar and a soldier sprayed downwards with bullets, one of which hit my daughter’s back pack and scratched her smart phone. “It was a miracle we all survived but it was truly terrying. “But we had the word ‘children’ painted on the gate so clearly they either do not care or they just want to kill everybody, who knows ” One man, aged , is recovering in Kyiv hospital from a bad bullet wound in his arm from the basement attack and he was the only person hit.  She refused to be photographed since she is terried the Russians, who left more than a week ago, willto kill her. In her back garden she shows us a ft deep pit she heard the Russians digging, which they were shouting was to “bury dead bodies.” There is no way of knowingthis was true as it could equally have been to hide once of their tanks, even though the area was totally secluded. Houses in Andriivka are riddled with bullets, shell holes and huge blast marks and holes, unexploded shells lying discarded on the ground, at the side of the road. Ten miles away the mostly destroyed town of Borodyanka looks like a monster has trampled through it breathing fire onto everything in its path. Entire apartment blocks are smashed in half, reduced to rubble by wave after wave of airstrikes and then tank shells and small arms. As marauding Russians came into town at the beginning of the now six weeks-long war they sprayed almost every home with bullets, leaving as many as  people below the rubble.  Today we watched as rescue teams sted and dug through several mini “ground zeros,” having found  corpses the previous day. Some wounded survivors have been found but hope is now fading for those who fled underground and were unfortunate to be crushed to death or buried alive. In Borodoyanka Eugene Yenin, Kyiv’s First Deputy to the Minister of the Interior, was meeting devastated locals to discuss their future. Afterwards he told us: “What you see here and where in Ukraine is a lot of tears and horror. “We are here to reassure and support the locals that we are here to help with the infrastructure and their future, water, power.” And then he made an astonishing claim, that Russian soldiers marked murdered civilian’s homes with a Soviet-era code for “dead bodies.”  He said the troops marked the number “” on the gates of houses to denote that “dead bodies” were inside. It is a throwback to Soviet era Afghanistan when the  mark meant a dead body or bodies were nearby. Askedhe meant “civilian bodies” he replied: “Yes - civilians. “This is to say the Russians are telling other troops ‘we have already visited here.” He added: “This is a remote village or town, where people are not well-to-do and they need help as you can see.  “Around  bodies were found yesterday and another six in a dferent apartment block. “We are discovering in some places where the Russians have been booby-trapped washing machines, with a grenade inside. “There are the bodies of people who have been shot randomly. “It is a terrible situation but there will be a future here.”  Today Kramatorsk’s hospitals were struggling with the numbers of wounded as Ukraine officials said no military personnel were nearby at the time of the attack. The governor of Ukraineaposs eastern Donetsk accused Russian forces of firing cluster munitions at the station, where thousands were at the time. Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said: If at the beginning they exclusively ... targeted railway tracks, then now itaposs not only tracks, but also firing a missile containing cluster munitions which are meant for people.“This is absolute confirmation that thiswas intended against civilians.  British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Russia may have committed another war crime and vowed to do everything to ensure Vladimir Putin fails in Ukraine and predicted the war would backfire for the Russian president. Mr Wallace, visiting Romania for talks, said: The striking of civilians and critical infrastructure is a war crime.“These were precision missiles aimed at people trying to seek humanitarian shelter.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ben WallaceBoris JohnsonVladimir PutinHospitalsSoldiersWar crimesCrimePoliticsRussia Ukraine warDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

The goal settled the Royal Burgh side, and Lewis Montgomery added a brace on  and  minutes.In Mowi South Division , Kilmory ran out - winners against a young Oban Celtic second team at sun-drenched MacRae Park, Lochgilphead.Goals from Sandy Leiper on  minutes and three by Alex Cunninghamsealed the points for the Kilmory.The home side enjoyed a good first half and would be disappointed with aof just two goals. Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage. It did not take long for Craig Speirs to gave the islanders the lead on six minutes, rling home from the angle.Two minutes later Inveraray were level, Neil Campbell showing scoring from  yards.Bute again took the lead in the th minute when Aray failed to clear and Aiden McGregor took advantage.The home side settled into the game after that setback and started to play some decent shinty, though, despite creating numerous chances, the sides went into half time with the score - to Bute.Inveraray started the second half the better of the two sides, giving the youthful Bute side problems settling.With Inveraray pressing it took until the th minute for the equaliser to arrive Neil Campbell again driving the ball home.

All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked.

the past year.His other serial, ‘Stubby sees it through,’ was third.In London and other regions, ‘Tiger Mountain’ was a close third only a few votes behind ‘Jennings at School’ and ‘The Bell

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve.

to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.There is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website here.The Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours."},{"url":null,"title":"galaxy-smarties-see-easter-eggs-least-sugar","story":"Expressdentist was intrigued to find out which Easter eggs could be the best and worst for your teeth, based on sugar content, so it investigated to see what the worst for sugar content is, so you don’t need to avoid all sweet treats this Easter.Coming in the joint top spot for the Easter eggs worst for your teeth are Galaxy Ripple and Galaxy Minstrels Easter Eggs with g of sugar per g.Although two Mars Galaxy products take the top spot, the other two Mars Galaxy productsrank respectively th and nd.: I tried Aldis new Easter egg range - but which ones are worth buying In second place is the Smarties Easter Egg with .g of sugar per g.

The programme took Wogan’s broadcasting genius for grantedFair enough. But his path wasnt always a smooth one, as Ken Sweeney’s RTE drama Wogan’s Sweet Sixteen, which aired towards the end of last year, pointed out. Five decades ago, having an Irish accent on the radio at the height of the IRA  bombing campaign on the mainland was not always an easy gig.But Wogan persevered and then prospered because he was very good at what he did. And Wogan: In His Own Words took that idea as its mission statement.“The two most important characteristics and qualications for working in TV and radio and broadcasting are empathy and curiosity,” Dermot O’Leary suggested at one point. “You have to have both, and I think Terry had them in spades.”Wogan also made broadcasting seem easy. Maybe because it was to him. Jeremy Vine recalled once getting into a lt with Wogan at .am one morning. Vine turned to the Irishman and said, “’Terry, you’re on the air in  seconds.’ And he replied ‘Yes, I’m early this morning.’”All the usual beats – Dallas, the Eurovision Song Contest – got a mention, but the person who had the most interesting things to say about Wogan was Wogan himself.“A lot of people in our business are introverted and shy or have an illusion that they are introverted and shy,” Wogan said at one point. “But radio is the medium for the introverted egomaniac anyway. And that’s what I suppose I am.”Why should any of this matter, you might ask  He was just a DJ, after all. Wogan had an answer for that argument.“There’s nothing more intrinsically worthwhile in reading the news than there is in presenting a quiz programme,” he argued. “There is nothing more worthwhile in being Robin Day than there is in being me, just because what Robin Day does is serious and what I do is trivial. If one thinks in terms of how much one has contributed to the sum of human happiness, or something as pretentious as that, I would say that Robin Day and I come out about level.”Frankly, I find that hard to argue with.Over on Radio  Dawn French and Jenner Saunders are currently back together in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane Austen  David Quantick’s sitcomon Friday mornings.Saunders plays Selena, a past-her-best movie star, while French is Florence, a writer desperate for attention.

Sure, but in the meantime, bring on the summer season totes and those Millport-sized kitchen islands.Imagine how history might have been dferentMargaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan had met each other earlier in their lives and married. [Pause for theatrical shudder.]According to the two-part documentary, Thatcher and Reagan: A Very Special Relationshipthe pair were as close as two friends in politics could be. There was no suggestion the relationship was closer than that, despite the tease of a title.Charles Moore, Mrs Thatcher’s authorised biographer, was the man in charge. He opened the film surrounded by some of Mrs T’s handbags, reminding viewers what it meant for a Cabinet Minister to be “handbagged” by her. Ronald Reagan did not have quite that fate, though she was not afraid to let him know when she was disappointed, as she was with America’s declared neutrality in the run-up to the Falklands conflict.Moore worked his contacts from his books and landed a few big fish as talking heads, some of them better known at the time than now, but offering valuable insights all the same. There was the personal touch, too, as he reminisced with Cynthia Crawford, “Crawfie”, Mrs Thatcher’s indispensable PA.Cruise missiles, Greenham Common, the Cold War, how long ago it all seemed, particularly with the news as it is now. The film suffered as a result, but there were a few nuggets worth sharing, and the insights into Reagan, adored his strong mother, alcoholic father, made a lot of sense.A busy time on the domestic front with a couple of shows ing and a newbie on the block. Anyone would think it was spring cleaning season.The idea is seductive – an organised le is the key to a happier, less stressful existence –not exactly deep. I can’t see home organising becoming one of the great religions of the world, but it is a harmless enough pastime. Do pop some ear plugs in before viewing: contains lots of girly screaming, especially from the blokes, when they see the wonders home editors Clea and Joanna make happen.By my reckoning, The Great Home Transformationis the st show of its kind, or at least it feels that way. Presented by Nick Grimshaw and Emma Willis, its USP was its ordinariness.Tech was used to show the rooms most used by a family, and the house rearranged and decluttered accordingly.No walls were knocked through or otherwise harmed in the making of this programme. Are you taking note Kirstie There was so much product from a certain Swedish superstore it came as no surprise to find they were the show’s sponsors.At the end of the hour, asked what the tidy up would do for the family, mum said: “I can just imagine people smiling more.” Ill take that.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

However, Holyrood and local authorities lack the powers to do this and Anas Sarwar wouldn’t even sign a joint-party letter demanding the devolution of these powers. Also, Labour voted against doubling the Scottish Child Payment to help hard-pressed families.Other than high energy costs, Brexit is the biggest cause of UK austerity and falling exports is causing real problems for our businesses, yet Sir Keir Starmer told LBC on Wednesday that “theres no case for rejoining the EU” and is in favour of the most expensive nuclear energy option which will add hundreds on to household bills for years to come. Scotland can’t afford UK Labour in power.As a leading energy-exporting country Scotland does not need nuclear power stations and should be focusing on the production of hydrogen fuel cells, the clean energy future for gas boilers, cars and ferries.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.* GROWING up in the s, we were informed that Scotland led the world with nuclear power. It was a nonsense of course. Scotland had and has no nuclear industry: we do not design, build or export our nuclear expertise.Nuclear power remains hugely expensive and dficult to build, needs guaranteed access to coolant at a time of increasingly serious climate events requires costly state intervention with subsidies, insurance and security. There is no long-term solution to waste. Scotland should utilise its share of funding to build expertise and an export industry around tidal power and green hydrogen.I actually heard a trade union rep complain that without nuclear power Scotland, as part of the UK grid, would partly rely on England’s gas-powered electricity generator. Was he really unaware that much of that gas originates in Scotland GR Weir, Ochiltree.* I HAVE been following the reaction to the UK Government’s decision to go nuclear and maintain its restrictions on onshore turbines.I wonder thoughyet again Westminster is missing yet another cheaper option.Why are we not placing bladeless turbines up and down our motorways and trunk roads  The turbines, while not quite as efficient as their bladed cousins, are cheaper to manufacture, install and maintain. Further, placing them along the roadways both avoids many planning constraints and provides another source of generation as well as the wind, ie passing vehicles. Just think, all those lampposts powered for free and the excess used to power service stations and homes nearby. Maybe even electric cars no, that would be an imaginative step too far.Perhaps before the A dialling finishes and any other major road project Holyrood might want to take the lead and plan for a bladeless contribution to our power needs.John Davidson, Carnoustie.TORIES RANCID PHILOSOPHYDR RM Morrishits the nail on the head when he characterises the Johnson Government as \"supremely competent\" in pursuing its own narrow interests rather than the interests of all its citizens. Thus the wealthy, oligarchic backers and Brexit-loving xenophobes are appeased by policies and promises that are entirely self-centred and devoid of empathy where the less well-off are concerned.This particular nail would have been obvious to many for some considerable time, but clearly not enough, as the results of the last election show us. Voters should ponder long and hard whether they wish to continue to collude with such a rancid philosophy.Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.WE MUST CHANGE THE TAX LAWSAS wein the press re the UK Chancellor’s we avoiding tax , I wonder when we are going to tackle the real issue.The social group that benefits from the current tax laws is the same group that made the tax laws and the business laws that – while intended initially to encourage investment – now just protect business people from the very market forces they are always banging on about. Ditto the same group that made the company laws that saw Sir Philip Green get away with asset-stripping British Home Stores and running up huge pension deficits while buying multi-million-pound yachts for his own pleasure.It was legal. Everyone knows it was wrong but the law protected him.Those same laws mean that those who benefit from government subsidy, post-privatisation of almost everything, are de facto living off massive social handouts – the very sort which is derided when givento poor people.Pinpointing the vile iniduals who have accumulated so much of the world’s wealth while people starve and suffer the effects of climate devastationis no longer a thing.The real thing is, laws need to be updated and made fit for purpose to reflect what actually happens in the st century.Amanda Baker, Edinburgh.WHATS FAIR IS FAIRAMID all the huffing and puffing about Rishi Sunaks Budget and wealth I spotted this on Twitter: \"This fair society thing. I know exactly what it is. Everyone richer than me can pay more in taxes. Preferably a windfall tax too for being richer than me. Everyone whose property is worth more than mine should pay punitive inheritance tax on their death. Everyone who owns a car bigger than mine should pay a much higher road tax. Then my taxes could be lowered and benefits through public services that I personally would use could be raised. That seems fair to me.\"Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.TV TREATS US LIKE CHILDRENI REMEMBER the Vietnam War but have no recollection of TV news reports from the time being prefaced with warnings about distressing content. I’m also pretty sure that in  the BBC didn’t preface Richard Dimbleby’s dispatches from Bergen-Bn with such advisories.Now, however, in the excellent coverage of the Ukraine war, we are endlessly told, as for example in Channel  News on Thursday, five times in  minutes, that \"this report contains distressing images\".We know that these images will be distressing, it’s war, we understand this, we do not need broadcasters treating us like children. For those who don’t want to see reality, they know where the \"off\" switch is.Stuart Neville, Clydebank.WE CANT DECIDE ON PEACENEIL Mackay describes reports of atrocities in Ukraine with Russia as the likely culprit . He writes that evenRussia withdraws from Ukraine \"there can be no peace until both Putin and his regime are destroyed\".So far Ukraine is the only country at war with Russia, not the UK. Commentators from our country cannot decide whether peace terms are acceptable to the countries at war.Allan Mackenzie, Cumbernauld.THE OTHER WH SMITHIAN McConnells article was not just interesting from a business perspective, but also from an educational one. Narrating the le and legacy of John Menzies and the business he founded was very informative.The mention of the takeover by WH Smith in the s reminded me of another WH Smith who has largely been forgotten by history.

I was reminded of an occasion, years ago, waiting for a train on Queen Street Stations low level . A fellow passenger castigated a railway employee who emerged from an office that the litter-strewn  was a disgrace to which the employee replied : \"I didnt drop the litter there, madam.\"I am sure it is not Glasgow City Council which drops all the litter. A litter-free city, indeed country, lies in our own hands.Bob Byiers, Bearsden.AN OWN GOAL FROM SCOTRAILI AM going to Hampden Park on Tuesday evening to watch the Scotland Women’s National Team play Spain. On checking the train times from Mount Florida after the match, I discover that it is an hourly service. I shall therefore drive to the game, as I am sure many others will do.

One study found up to  per cent of cases could be prevented or delayed by inidual or policy changes.Prof Ritchie said progress in introducing preventative clinics across Scotland was being delayed by the “structural layers of numerous health boards”.He said there was some frustration that Scotland’s “enviable position” in dementia research, prevention and treatment was “slow to be picked up from some agencies within Scottish Government and the NHS”.: Concern as elderly locked up in Scots care homes as Westminster scraps close contact ruleHe said the NHS should be moving towards a system that prioritises “health maintenance” over the treatment of illness and said efforts to prevent disease such as dementia were being halted by a system that “waits until people are sick”.He said the pandemic had led to “transformative” change within the NHS by giving people access to their own vaccine status and suggested widening this out to medical records could empower people to take ownership of their own health.Mr Ritchie, who is Professor of the Psychiatry of Ageing at the University of Edinburgh, said he was in favour of opening up health services to other qualied providers while maintaining the NHS’s “free at the point of delivery” founding principle and said it was an approach Brain Health Scotland was keen to explore under his leadership.He said: “Although there are several entities within government dedicated to this work – the fact we have numerous health boards and other structural layers can make translating this envied position globally into a real dference in the lives of people at high risk of developing dementia, when in fact the opposite should be true.“In the future, I think the public and people working in the NHS need to set new, more ambitious targets and demands for what excellence in healthcare looks like and be motivated to achieve this.“In Brain Health Scotland, we are committed to having brain health services available for everyone in Scotland by , in doing so we will take a major step forward in preventing dementia across the country.\"National service delivery, which is innovative and transformative though has to be filtered currently by local health boards, and such national initiatives would really benefitwe had a dynamic, single national health board providing leadership with local boards tasked to deliver on these nationally agreed pathways.”: Drug used to treat depression could prevent dementia, study suggests He said the relationship between the NHS and the public had been  “fundamentally changed” by the pandemic through vaccine certication and this could be expanded in other areas to improve health.He said: “When the NHS was founded in  a top-down, paternalistic model of healthcare was a reflection of hundredsnot thousands of years of medical practice, but now, with knowledge at virtually everyone’s fingertips, the relationship between health care provider and the public is fundamentally changing. “In brain health service that is grounded in health maintenance not management of symptomatic disease, the person will be very much in charge, starting with owning their own medical information. “It was a subtle but actually transformative moment when we each had our own detailed vaccine information on an app on our phones. I hope that is just the start of having your entire medical record at our fingertips.”He said health boards were set up around hospitals with “huge gravitational pull for resources” adding, “the reality is that we want to move towards undertaking much more healthcare via digital solutions that have no boundaries geographically.”“This doesn’t mean to say we throw out the baby with the bathwater because people like to be seen face to face by their nurse, pharmacist, doctor, etc – but so much health information can be collected both actively and passively from remote testing on smart phones or computers and be provided to the practitioner ahead of their appointment.: SNP accused of breaking pre-election pledge to tackle dementia tax“st century healthcare has to be leading a digital revolution and get to the forefront of the use of data sciences and Articial Intelligence, which have until now been dominated by the financial, military, retail and social media world.”He said Scotland was the only country working on all three programmes of a new global initiative set up by the World Economic Forum that aims to better understand the earliest stages of dementia.The first brain health clinic was launched in Edinburgh before the pandemic struck and also gives patients access to new drug trials.Kevin Stewart, Minister for Social Care, said: “The Scottish Government is providing funding to Brain Health Scotland to take a national role to ensure that optimal brain health is part of public health policy, clinical research and clinical practice to reduce the risk of developing or preventing some forms of dementia and consequently help reduce incidence and prevalence.“We are working with Brain Health Scotland and others to establish pilot brain health services within the NHS.\"We continue to support NHS boards and local partners to improve dementia care and are working to implement the commitments in the Dementia Covid- Recovery Plan.“Recent figures for   on the percentage of those referred for dementia “We want everyone who is entitled to post-diagnostic support to be offered a referral.\"That’s why we are allocating an additional, ring-fenced sum of £. million last financial year and this new financial year, and so that we can meet the service shortfall and address iation across health boards.”“It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649233437067.jpg--chinese_named_northern_ireland_s_most_popular_takeaway.jpg?1649233438000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220406newschinese named northern ireland s most popular takeaway","story":"The decision-making process of ordering a takeaway often ides opinion, with debates sparking almost every day as households fail to come to an agreement on which delicious treat they should indulge in.

The strike comes after members of the union overwhelmingly voted for industrial action after rejecting the latest Translink management pay offer. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham expressed her support for the striking bus workers. She said, “These bus workers are frontline workers – they deserve respect and a pay increase.

When we clapped every Thursday night, we said the essential workers would not be forgotten or left behind. But during this cost of living crisis, Translink is forgetting their own workers. “The dispute, which affects bus drivers, cleaners and shunters will close the entire bus network within Northern Ireland. It will be a complete shutdown.” A Translink spokesperson said they were disappointed that the unions hadvoted to take industrial action. “Following extensive negotiations, including with the Labour Relations Agency, we made a pay offer of % plus an enhanced package of conditions that included a % increase in weekend and overtime rates along with  extra days holiday, they said. “We believe this was a fair and reasonable offer and have at all times been open to discussions.

That means there is much for visitors to explore, from ancient to modern history.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s Bay‘There’s no place like home’: Derry Girls writer Lisa McGee reacts to city being named among top places to live in NIYou have the completely intact -year-old Derry Walls which is a real selling point for tourists.Other historic landmarks include the Guildhall — where it now stands was once the middle of the River Foyle where ships moored. It was mostly destroyed by fire in  and after extensive rebuilding was opened in .Because it is relatively small in size, Derry is an easy place to navigate for visitors.A key piece of infrastructure built in recent times was the Peace Bridge.Nowadays it is hard to imagine the city without it, and it’s an area of recreation popular with walkers and joggers.That area is arguably the best feature of the city, expanding the city centre, linking to Ebrington, St Columb’s Park and the renovated railway station.The Peace Bridge connects the Cityside and Waterside it was a masterstroke both in practical terms and as an act of symbolism by reconnecting the largely Catholic Cityside to the traditionally unionist Waterside. Derry is also a city of culture — made official in  — with musicians, poets, painters and actors famous the world over.Danny Boy is one of the most famous songs in the world, and has been covered by Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Eva Cassidy. Phil Coulter, The Undertones, Dana, Cara Dillon, Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol fame, Red Organ Serpent Sound, Fighting with Wire, SOAK and Wood Burning Savages show the range of musicians Derry has produced.It is also a city with proud sporting traditions in GAA and football and has produced Olympic medallists and world champions who first learned their trade on Derry’s pitches, roads and rivers.Nowhere does a festival like Derry, but there should be more added to the calendar.You have Glasgowbury in Draperstown, the City of Derry Jazz and Big Band Festival, the legendary Halloween festival and, in recent times, the Foyle Maritime Festival, which have all proven popular.When considering Derry, you also have to factor in the location. A short drive across the border and you’re in some of the world’s nicest beaches including Dunree and Tullagh Bay.To Derry’s advantage in the Sunday Times survey was an average house price of £,.“Reaping the rewards of years of investment and with a fine cultural reputation, this much-improved city stands out as somewhere cool, credible and cheap, with a bright future,” The Sunday Times states.But most people in the city would disagree with that statement, as multiple-deprivation measures, unemployment rates and analysis of investment show the second city has not received a great deal of inward investment.For example, since Invest NI was formed in  until   it has assisted , new jobs in Belfast whereas Foyle got , and East Londonderry ,.In that time it invested £.bn in Belfast and £.bn between Foyle and East Londonderry.Most ReadBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s BayBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtProtestant worker who claimed ‘intimidation’ when colleagues played ‘anti-British’ songs has claim rejectedMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionPopular Portadown student killed in Cookstown lorry accident ‘had whole le ahead of him’Top VideosPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattiePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murder\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRhys McClenaghan becomes new Guinness World Record holderLatest Northern IrelandOur wee city used to be all about the walls and the Troubles ...

It’s all self-taught. My husband is a computer games artist, so I take a lot of advice from him, but a lot of it is Googling how to do things and, I think, having a bit of an eye for design anyway. None of it is perfect, I’m sure someone who is qualied and experienced in this field would be able to pull up something quicker and a lot more eye-catching, but I’m pleased with the way it turns out.”The Coleraine woman said she spent a few days last week “going round the constituency getting some photographs just to get nice fresh images for the literature”, but overall she’s kept to the same colour scheme and theme for her election content since she first stood in .“It can take a while, but sitting down I can get into a bit of a zone with it. You can find me maybe starting it at pm and still sitting until am in the morning because I’m on a bit of a roll with it. There’s other days when I get a bit of a block and that’s usually the days where you’re under pressure and trying to make deadlines for printers.”She joked: “If the election doesn’t go my way, maybe I have another career!”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Related topicsClaire SugdenMore On Claire Sugden PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseUkraine crisis: Stormont urged to ‘step up’ and pressure Home Office into waiving visa requirement for refugeesSugden’s anger as Stormont crisis endangers mental health court planStaffing crisis in agri-food industry is down to immigration rules, Poots toldIndependent unionist Claire Sugden ‘less likely’ to join UUP following Doug Beattie tweet stormMost ReadBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s BayBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtProtestant worker who claimed ‘intimidation’ when colleagues played ‘anti-British’ songs has claim rejectedMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionPopular Portadown student killed in Cookstown lorry accident ‘had whole le ahead of him’Top VideosPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattiePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner DornanLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaNorthern Ireland Assembly elections candidates in full: Who is standing in your area UUP Peer Empey claims ‘credible rumours’ emerging in Westminster Article  will be triggered after Stormont electionNorthern Ireland Assembly election : People ‘have a choice’ to attend polling stationCovid positive, Electoral Office confirmsDUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyLatestAsk Louanne: I don’t like letting people down in work… but is there an easy way to say no Derry author Brian McGilloway: ‘For me, all stories are human stories’Donal Skeehan’s easy meals that really pay offClton Nursing Home: ‘If we had any inkling it was so bad, we’d not have let mum go there’Easter Break  in Northern Ireland: Egg hunts, themed train rides and picnics in the park to look forward to,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Graham Baalham-CurryApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailYou can’t drink your morning coffee without an audience and as you walk down the road you are watched from all angles, both geometrically and politically.That’s right — election season is upon us and as a result, the faces of your local politicians on poster after poster are becoming more familiar than the heartthrobs we had on our walls as teenagers.It is one staple of election campaigns that has been around for decades,not centuries, and while there’s some sport initially in comparing the tenets of graphic design, colour schemes and haircutsof our political representatives, when you sit and think about it, is this something that’s really needed in this day and age As a journalist, I’m probablymore familiar with Northern Ireland’s politicians than the average person, given my job involves thinking, talking and writing about them on a daily basis. As such, I don’t often need a reminder of who there is to vote for in my constituency or what parties they stand for. I’ll admit that an election poster is certainly an easy way to raise awareness of, on a basic level, exactly who represents or wants to represent you.But after seeing the same person staring at me five times before I had crossed a single bridge in Coleraine where I live the other day, I started to wonder do posters influence how people vote — or are posters just a habit, one which may not serve the most purpose but indicates you have a dog in the fight Read MoreIndependent candidate Claire Sugden using her artistic flair for election materialThe ironic thing is that maybe posters mean much more to the smaller parties and independents with comparably smaller budgets to the more prominent frontrunners. For them, it’s more of a stretch to measure up the level of postering and the legwork it takes displayed by other parties but who worry they won’t get as much attentionthey don’t appear to have parity in terms of faces on streets.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Often described as CorriBoard posters, many of those massive signs you see on our streets and roads are made from one of the dirtiest words of our time — plastic. While the materials can sometimes be upcycled, it is suggested they will take hundreds of years to degrade, long after the politicians whose faces on which they featured and possibly even the parties they represented have departed this fine earth.It’s true that they do have benefits. They are immune to hackers which have plagued recent international elections . Not everyone has top class internet access so it does keep demographics informed. There’s no question that they send a message to voters and a reminder that an election is taking place — andyour local MLA hasn’t fixed that pothole on your road, you will know just the face to ask when they come a-canvassing.Green Party NI politician Mal O’Hara has joined some of his international colleagues in favouring a system seen in Europe where paper posters are erected in certain spaces only, instead of being festooned on every available surface. But this approach isn’t favoured by some larger parties who are able to spread their resources more widely and want to be able to show that. And so, without any wider consensus, the great poster parade marches on even in  when the word on all of our lips is the environment and many of us are kept awake at night wondering what sort of a world it is we’re leaving behind for the next generation and the one after that.What is the alternative  Some may argue it’s already here, and it’s called social media, where most views are shared and heard and your popularity isn’t always just down to what party backs you, but how well you use your voice. There’s also mainstream media via the television, news sites and newspapers as well as the radio. And for those who have access to neither, there’s canvassing — and feel free to reject those shiny leaflets which usually take a short trip to the bin in favour of a chat instead.Or why not make use of the screens in Belfast city centre or in shopping centres to instead display candidates posters on a revolving basis, on the proviso that these screens and devices would have to be made more widely available in our towns and villages Some may disregard these suggestions but surely there must be another way, instead of risking damage to the environment and obscuring our beautul landscape on this island with these massive posters cropping up at regular intervals.Whatever your thoughts on posters, the discourse around them doesn’t end after the election unfortunately. And while you might find the face of a local politician peaking out from behind a hedge or unlucky enough to be placed atop a bonfire, you will also be treated to the crowdsourcing operation that is your local politician asking you to make them aware of any forlorn final poster still lingering on our streets. Or at the very least, a photo of them with clippers in hand, telling all they are out and about removing their posters, sent to the rubbish heap, after election season comes to an end.Related topicsGreen PartyMore On Green PartyClimate Change Bill was ‘not everything’ Green Party leader Clare Bailey hoped for PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behind PremiumFionola MeredithOpinionWhy there’s no such thing as giving kids a ‘loving smack’Most ReadBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s BayBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtProtestant worker who claimed ‘intimidation’ when colleagues played ‘anti-British’ songs has claim rejectedMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionPopular Portadown student killed in Cookstown lorry accident ‘had whole le ahead of him’Top VideosPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattiePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner DornanLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaNorthern Ireland Assembly elections candidates in full: Who is standing in your area UUP Peer Empey claims ‘credible rumours’ emerging in Westminster Article  will be triggered after Stormont electionNorthern Ireland Assembly election : People ‘have a choice’ to attend polling stationCovid positive, Electoral Office confirmsDUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyLatestAsk Louanne: I don’t like letting people down in work… but is there an easy way to say no Derry author Brian McGilloway: ‘For me, all stories are human stories’Donal Skeehan’s easy meals that really pay offClton Nursing Home: ‘If we had any inkling it was so bad, we’d not have let mum go there’Clton Nursing Home: Damning report reveals litany of failures during Covid outbreak,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If someone has been shielding or there are mental health issue or other vulnerabilities, it would be reasonable at this point to say ‘I couldn’t expose myself to risk’,” she added.Government has directed that in Northern Ireland the normal absent vote legislation should apply, so there has been no change in Northern Ireland to make allowance for Covid and that means April  is such an important deadline for anyone who has been shielding or who is frail or vulnerable.”The Department of Health has been approached for comment.Most ReadBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s BayBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtProtestant worker who claimed ‘intimidation’ when colleagues played ‘anti-British’ songs has claim rejectedMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionPopular Portadown student killed in Cookstown lorry accident ‘had whole le ahead of him’Top VideosPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattiePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner DornanLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaNorthern Ireland Assembly elections candidates in full: Who is standing in your area UUP Peer Empey claims ‘credible rumours’ emerging in Westminster Article  will be triggered after Stormont electionDUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyArlene Foster says ‘all to play for’ in Assembly election even with Sinn Fein ahead in ‘most of the polls’LatestAsk Louanne: I don’t like letting people down in work… but is there an easy way to say no Derry author Brian McGilloway: ‘For me, all stories are human stories’Donal Skeehan’s easy meals that really pay offClton Nursing Home: Damning report reveals litany of failures during Covid outbreakClton Nursing Home: ‘If we had any inkling it was so bad, we’d not have let mum go there’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine. I wish them every success with their proposal to develop a walking route, which will bring much pleasure to local and international visitors. .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down High star in event  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Day is always a special occasion in the sporting calendar and this year thankfully events at The Meadows Equestrian Centre were back to normal.The annual inter-school showjumping competition attracted teams from across the province, and the open class, which was a qualier for Balmoral Show was particularly competitive.In the novice class, Sarah Carse, Emily Carse, Ellen MacNabb and Sophie Herron were narrowly beaten into second place.In the open class, Down High had been drawn th in the competition, and just before they entered the arena, only one other school had finished the course on a zero score.The spectator grandstand was full, the weather was close to perfect and the fences were set to be executed with precision.It had proved reasonably tricky so far and understandably the four riders from Down High were more nervous than usual.However, after a breath-taking effort the Down High Flyers managed to finish on a zero score and the clock showed that they had also beaten the time of all the other teams.The presentation of awards quickly followed.Abby Cummiskey, Annie Gibson, Megan Nelson and Zara Sharvin entered the arena once again to receive their rosettes and coveted ticket to Balmoral Show.It was a proud day for their chef drsquoequipe Ruth Adams, their parents and indeed for Down High School.They are now looking forward to a great day out at the Bluegrass Open Championship at Balmoral Showgrounds on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down U","story":"DOWN came into this game on the back of a strong finish to their league campaign to secure second spot in Ulster and earn a Platinum final against a highly fancied Armagh team.During the league when these two teams matched up, just three weeks ago, it took until after half-time before Down registered their first score. However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway which will be cut down through the steep shore bank and will involve reinforced piling.Once completed the station will be ready to take delivery of the new leboat, which will be named the Bryant and Eleanor Girling after a generous RNLI benefactor.SAINTFIELD mdash Three workmen and two police officers required hospital treatment after a chemical spill in Saintfield last week.Four  gallon drums containing a mixture of acid and caustic soda, fell from a lorry on the Old Grand Jury Road at around am on Friday morning, initiating a full-scale emergency response from the Fire Brigade.Appliances from Ballynahinch and Downpatrick were sent to the scene and a specialist equipment carrying emergency tender unit was also despatched from Belfast.The incident occurred as the articulated lorry was leaving a yard on the Old Grand Jury Road carrying a large number of the chemical-containing drums.The four drums fell from the lorry, with two spilling several hundred gallons of the corrosive mixture onto the road.The lorry driver and his two assistants quickly righted the drums but suffered from fume inhalation, as did two police officers who arrived on the scene minutes after the spill.All five were treated at the Downe Hospital but were later released.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Environmentrsquos proposals for the management of Strangford Lough have been welcomed as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside community have been looking for.ldquoThe new body represents a wide spectrum of community support, including the pockets of power which were driven largely by their own self-interests, he said.MOURNES mdash Health officials have been accused of ldquoplucking figures from nowhere to justy closure plans for Newcastlersquos Mourne House.The Eastern Health Council heard this week that a renovation figure of pound, for the residential home has been produced without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report.The claims were made by a deputation from the Friends of Mourne House which addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide a first response to cardiac emergencies pending the arrival of an ambulance.The presentation was made on Monday to Portaferry GPs Dr Desmond Compton and Dr David Peacock by Mr Peter Welsh, the Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health Boardrsquos chief ambulance officer, Mr Alan Murray.The Ambulance Service has funded the inclusion of sophisticated diagnostic facilities on the defibrillator, as well as communication systems for the doctors to ensure their immediate availability.BALLYNAHINCH mdash One of Down Districtrsquos biggest charity events of the year will take place in Ballynahinch next month.The Ballynahinch Lions k and fun runs will be staged on Saturday, May , and once again look likely to raise several thousand pounds for charity.In its third year the event has already raised pound, and the organisers are hoping that next monthrsquos event will top the pound total which was raised last year.This yearrsquos beneficiaries will be the Leukaemia Research Fund, the Marie Curie Trust, Beaconsfield, and Lions charities.The event, which is over a proven course and backed by the Northern Ireland Amateur Athletics Federation, has already become established as one of the major events on the athletics calendar and will attract runners from many parts of the province.Once again the run will begin at .pm at the Community Centre in Windmill Street, and part of the route will be through the grounds of the Montalto Estate.Lots of dferent categories have been designated by the Lions and there are prizes on offer for practically everything, from the first k runner home to the best fancy dress team.A new aspect of the event this year will be the Tracy Barr Memorial Trophy which school teams will be competing for over the K fun run

Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility. In that context, I do not consider there to be any need for this proposal.A spokesperson for Arc said there was still a ldquoclear need to develop a ldquonew, modern waste infrastructure for the region.It said the proposed facility would boost recycling, reduce emissions and provide green electricity.ldquoIt is essential that Arc has an opportunity to review the planning reasons behind the ministerrsquos statement and we will carefully consider todayrsquos announcement in that light over the next few days, added the spokesperson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Museum to shut doors over Easter  ","story":"THE Down County Museum in Downpatrick will be closed over Easter.The announcement came just hours after Newry, Mourne and Down Council refused to confirmthe museum would be open to the public over the busy Easter holiday period.Initially, the local authority would only confirm that a decision on the Easter opening would be made in ldquodue course, but within hours of informing the Recorder of this and the paper being printed, it was finally revealed that the museum would remain closed.The council has subsequently confirmed that a reduced staff team is delivering services at the museum mdash which only opens between am and pm from Wednesday and Friday mdash and it is ldquowith regret that it will not be open at Easter.The Recorder understands that are six vacant staff positions at the museum and that up to five staff members are currently off sick.Adverts to recruit new museum staff have been published this week with the local authority looking to appoint and assistant curator, education and outreach officer, museum assistant and a cultural assistant.While council officials are hoping to have new employees in place next month, the local authority has not made clear how many new staff are being recruited and what the Downpatrick museumrsquos future opening hours will be.The museum has been at the centre of a controversial staff restructuring process.Downpatrick SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said thee council should have made it clear last week that the museum would be closed at Easter.Welcoming plans to recruit new employees, he suggested that councillors should be briefed at a one-off council meeting by senior local authority officials on exactly what is happening at the museum.ldquoI remain disappointed that the museum will not be open at Easter. While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,. A good job well done.With the racing season in full flow, EDAC club members were quick to get signed up on the recent membership night so that they can keep training and also avail of the club discount when entering races.They might also have been encouraged by the raffle which was held at the sign-up.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFrom ice cream cone creations to vegan and gluten-free chocolate, I wanted to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.Salted caramel Easter eggsThere is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. .removeSome of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.The verdict: Which Aldi chocolate Easter eggs are worth buying From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website hereThe Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/20051502.aldi-announces-return-baby-toddler-sale-prices-99p/res","title":"aldi announces return baby toddler sale prices p","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Each autumn, Jays, a colourful member of the crow family, can often be seen flying back and forth finding and hiding acorns to help see them through the winter. These are then hidden in the cracks and crevices of trees, but also in leaf litter on the ground. An inidual jay can store around , acorns each year and many remain buried to grow into oak trees.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Mother and her daughter counting birds in their garden, Bedford, UK, January The RSPB’s Chief Executive, Beccy Speight said “We don’t know the reasons for the sudden increase in Jay sightings this year. It may be down to food availability as we have reports that last year was poor for acorns, but whatever the reason a sighting of this stunning bird is enough to raise one’s spirits any day of the year let alone on a gloomy January weekend.“It’s been brilliant to see so many people taking part again this year, taking time out to watch and reconnect with birds and then generously submit their sightings to help RSPB scientists gain some insights into how our garden birds are faring.”Big Garden Birdwatch results also found a small increase in Greenfinch compared to . This gives scientists a glimmer of hope that this might be the first signs of a popuation recovery, but only time will tell. In recent years the Greenfinch has suffered a population crashcaused by a severe outbreak of the disease trichomonosis and as a consequence the species was added to the UK Red list last year. This infection is spread through contaminated food and drinking water, or by birds feeding one another with regurgitated food during the breeding season. Garden owners can help slow transmission rates by temporarily stopping the provision of foodill birds are seen and making sure that garden bird feeders are cleaned regularly.The House Sparrow remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings as the most commonly seen garden bird with more than . million recorded sightings throughout the weekend. Blue Tit and Starling remained in the number two and three positions respectively.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Family filling up a bird feeder in their garden, Potton, Bedfordshire, UK, January Over its four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world. It was first to alert the RSPB to the decline in song thrush numbers, which are still down % compared to the first Big Garden Birdwatch in . This species was a firm fixture in the top  in .

Woodpigeon was the most numerous species seen with an average of eight per school and was seen in % of all schools that took part. Blackbird was a close second with an average of seven per school.Beccy added: “Connecting with nature doesn’t have to stop with Big Garden Birdwatch.

That and the mural were my two moments,” she said.The story follows a group of teenagers growing up in Northern Ireland in the s, around the time of the IRA and loyalist ceasefires.While the Troubles was an inescapable backdrop, the micro-dramas of teenagers navigating their parents, parties, love interests and school captured the attention of audiences far beyond Irish shores.Saoirse-Monica puts the success of the show entirely down to McGee and says she hopes that now the show has come to an end, that they can work again together in the future.“I’m very sad that its coming to an end,” she said. “It’s been the most amazing experience of my le. “But I don’t think it’s over, over because it will always be with us. It’s one of those shows that will stand the test of time.“I have been very fortunate as a young actor to have worked with Lisa McGee and to have a relationship with a great writer from my home town is something you can only dream about.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather.

Even without the gloom and doom of the news, we could escape the fallout of what is going on in the world around us.Alan MIllarWe watched Covid- advance across Europe until it reached our shores in March , and we hoped it would all pass by Christmas, but our hope was dashed on the rocks of reality, as the disease seemed to get worse, and the lockdown continued. The stress increased and the mental health of many people, young and old alike, continued to deteriorate.Their condition was compounded by what we saw on the TV - medical staff in hospitalsm battling day and night, non-stop, to save those who had fallen seriously ill.“We saw the toll it took on their emotional and mental health some were in tears, having just lost another patient. It wasn’t uncommon to hear someone say, “Where is God in all of this ” The truth is, God was right in the middle of the battle. He had foreknowledge of what was to come . Our hope was restored when a vaccine was discovered to combat the virus.God had guided the scientists to find the cure. It was a miracle. I wonder how many thanked God  However, no sooner did we begin to emerge from the pandemic, when we saw the Russian invasion of Ukraine, causing thousands of mothers with children and elderly women, with all their belongings in a bag,to flee for their lives. Thousands didn’t get away and many have died. The fear, stress and strain on their faces spoke volumes. And people asked, “Where is God in all of this ”. God was with them all the way. .Finally they reached Poland and other eastern European countries and it was the arms of God that welcomed them in the form of Polish people who showed God’s amazing love and compassion, welcoming them with food, clothes and shelter.People all over Europe and the UK sent thousands upon thousands of tons of food and clothing for their comfort.They found food and rest for their weary souls. .

These will be taken in conjunction with GMB who also represents bus workers at Translink. The strike action planned will be a week, starting April  and concluding on May , as well as a single day on Friday, May . The strike comes after members of the union overwhelmingly voted for industrial action after rejecting the latest Translink management pay offer. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham expressed her support for the striking bus workers. She said, “These bus workers are frontline workers – they deserve respect and a pay increase. Translink needs to grasp that there’s a cost of living crisis destroying the value of wages andwith a more acceptable offer. “Unite’s members have my full support and that of their union in taking this strike action for fairer pay.” Unite deputy Regional Secretary Davy Thompson is lead officer for Translink, Northern Ireland’s bus and rail public transport provider. He added:“Unite represents the overwhelming majority of bus workers, and this strike action taken in conjunction with GMB which also represents bus workers will shut down all bus services. “Bus workers deserve a pay increase. The ball is in the court of Translink management. They can to avoid this unnecessary and highly disruptive strike – they need to address our members’ legitimate pay expectations.” Meanwhile, Peter Macklin, GMB Organiser, said:Every worker deserves fair pay. With rampant inflation, this real terms cut is a slap in the face and will leave many struggling to cover their bills. “Translinkfails to recognise what workers went through during the pandemic. “They kept transport running so other essential workers could get to and from workplaces to perform vital roles. “Our members were proud to carry out their duty in delivering the service, potentially putting themselves and their families at risk. When we clapped every Thursday night, we said the essential workers would not be forgotten or left behind. But during this cost of living crisis, Translink is forgetting their own workers. “The dispute, which affects bus drivers, cleaners and shunters will close the entire bus network within Northern Ireland. It will be a complete shutdown.” A Translink spokesperson said they were disappointed that the unions hadvoted to take industrial action. “Following extensive negotiations, including with the Labour Relations Agency, we made a pay offer of % plus an enhanced package of conditions that included a % increase in weekend and overtime rates along with  extra days holiday, they said. “We believe this was a fair and reasonable offer and have at all times been open to discussions. We remain committed to working with the unions to avert this action. “We would welcome the opportunity to engage with unions to cover school duties, so that the wellbeing of schoolchildren can remain a priority. “All train services will continue to operate as normal. “We will communicate relevant passenger information through the media, on our website www.translink, through social media, in stations and on buses and trains. “Translink apologises for any inconvenience this may cause”.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bdeeaccace   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aecabcbdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
