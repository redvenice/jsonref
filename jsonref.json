The relationship between the parties irretrievably broke down following Mr Buckley\u0027s recent public and private statements. \u0027All trustees have made the decision to step down. A new board of trustees have been appointed and they have chosen to ask Mr Buckley\u0027s company, BNB services Ltd, to resume the provision of its support services\u0027. Mr Buckley worked for Manchester City Council for seven years before setting up Mancunian Way in 2011, which has helped thousands of BAME youngsters to secure jobs and spot the signs they are being groomed by criminal gangs.He previously told The Mail on Sunday that the charity\u0027s trustees had been put in a \u0027terrible situation\u0027 by the pressure on social media to axe him.\u0027That\u0027s why the mob wins. They make people take a step backwards and once you take one step backwards, they know you\u0027ll take another,\u0027 he said.Mr Buckley wrote his blog after protests organised by BLM UK following the killing of George Floyd by police in the US.  Writing on Medium.com on June 6 - the day protesters clashed with mounted police in London - Mr Buckley said its slogan \u0027is far too simple but is perfect for our modern age of social media and the willingness of social justice warriors to take up another cause.\u0027   He wrote: \u0027What is happening in the UK over the last few days has very little to do with the horrendous incident in the USA. \u0027It is better described as part \u0027new fashion craze\u0027 and part \u0027an opportunity for anarchy. Do you know who Black Lives Matter are? Do you know what this self-proscribed political movement wants? According to their website, they want to end white supremacy, disrupt the Western prescribed nuclear family and dismantle the patriarchal practice. These are fancy words, what do they mean?\u0027They are exactly what post-modern, neo-Marxists use when they call for the destruction of Western democracy and our way of life.\u0027  Referring to Floyd\u0027s criminal convictions, he questioned why the demonstrations were focused on the \u0027unlawful death of a career criminal\u0027 in the US rather than UK issues including knife crime, female genital mutilation, honour killings and a lack of house-building.  The response was immediate and furious. Writing on Mr Buckley\u0027s LinkedIn page, Reece Williams, a poet who works for a mental health charity in Manchester, said: \u0027Please know that we will be doing everything in our power to have you removed from your position. Expect us.\u0027A few days later, an online petition calling for Mr Buckley\u0027s removal was posted on Change.org by Karlet Manning, who also works for a mental health charity. The petition claimed his views \u0027undermine the Black Lives Matter movement whilst working in a erse community\u0027 and were \u0027inappropriate, insensitive and have since been deleted\u0027.On June 13, the row exploded on Twitter when the petition and Mr Buckley\u0027s comments began to be tweeted by Left-wing campaigners and anonymous accounts. Two days later, Mr Buckley received an email from the charity\u0027s trustees informing him their relationship with him was \u0027terminated\u0027. A red flag and the word \u0027victory\u0027 was later posted on the Change.org petition page.Mr Buckley said he stands by what he wrote, although he accepts he could have better conveyed some of his arguments. He said he had declined an offer from his trustees to issue an apology for the blog. \u0027That\u0027s the coward\u0027s way and I\u0027m not a coward,\u0027 he said. \u0027If I had the guts to say what I said, then I need the guts to stand up and continue to say what I said.\u0027 He holds no ill-feeling towards the trustees. \u0027They are lovely people but they weren\u0027t ready for a fight. They found themselves in a terrible situation not of their making - pressure online. Did I think it was controversial? \u0027Well, I knew it was going to upset some people because everything you put on social media upsets somebody. But it is not racist. I am not a racist.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Pentagons UFO hunting department NOT disbanded 2012 public reports","story":"Share this article2020-07-16 - Senator Marco Rubio on UAPs - YouTubeNo Longer in Shadows, Pentagon’s U.F.O.

We hope our study will provide some reassurance to new mothers that the risk of them passing Covid-19 to their babies is very low,\u0027 Salvatore said..\u0027However, larger studies are needed to better understand the risks of transmission from mother to child.\u0027Dr Patricia DeLaMora, also from the Komansky Children\u0027s Hospital who jointly led the study, said: \u0027We know that skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding are important both for mother-infant bonding and for long-term child health.\u0027Our findings suggest that babies born to mothers with Covid-19 infection can still benefit from these safely, if appropriate infection control measures are followed.\u0027 The biggest British study into Covid-19\u0027s effect on pregnant women and their children found that one in 20 of newborns born to infected women test positive for the virus. The study, published last month by the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS), looked at 427 women infected with the disease across the country Even though five per cent of children tested positive, they \u0027all lived very well\u0027, according to the researchers.  The researchers said it was \u0027probably\u0027 the case that most of these children caught the virus through the placenta of their mothers.But they said he couldn\u0027t rule out the possibility some caught it from their parent, or a midwife, after birth.The study was published in the prestigious British Medical Journal and cited by health chiefs as evidence as to why breastfeeding should continue even in infected women.   Tthe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said that separating mothers and babies at birth was more detrimental than the risk of Covid for infants.Just a handful of children have caught the coronavirus in Britain, and experts believe infants\u0027 risk of contracting the virus is \u0027unbelievably low\u0027.Doctors say infected children are far more likely to have no symptoms than they are to develop a severe case of COVID-19.   "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4bbf56c9a4f1dc046709abc60d9efaa50dcd664/0_269_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9348d455bacdb17dc6cce93d3fce8d6","title":"geisha life in the shadow of coronavirus in pictures","story":"Though the number of geisha - professional entertainers famed for their witty conversation, beauty and skill at traditional arts - has been falling for years, many have now been without work for months due to Japan’s state of emergency and now have to operate under awkward social distancing rules"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9188f094f3fa9ed73d55701e2e1d41e4eb961398/0_0_5200_3464/master/5200.jpg?width=740\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d81753d3a3d6158bc774c4ac4aec8a79 740w","title":"free speech has never been freer pankaj mishra and viet thanh nguyen in conversation","story":"Are we living through a moment of lasting change? Two authors discuss Black Lives Matter, the Harper’s letter and where we go from hereI am reminded, too, of a prize-winning writer who recently claimed in a tweet that African Americans were “fighting for democracy abroad”. Contrast this casual euphemising of American violence in multiple countries to Muhammad Ali’s principled refusal to join the assault on Vietnam. Such naive Americanism is striking. In the past African American leaders and artists, from WEB Du Bois to Nina Simone, simply assumed solidarity with peoples elsewhere they could see that the plights of the long-term victims of slave society and the societies despoiled by racial-ethnic supremacism were inseparably linked. What do you think happened to sunder that connection? Viet Thanh Nguyen: I think also of black radicals like Du Bois and Martin Luther King Jr, who are best known in the US for their critiques of racism within American society. Du Bois, of course, would go on after The Souls of Black Folk to be much more international in his life and thinking, and King delivered his speech “Beyond Vietnam” in 1967, near the end of his life. The speech connected anti-black racism with racist American warfare in Vietnam and elsewhere, and posited that these were inseparable. King’s civil rights colleagues didn’t want him to go in that direction. That strand of domestic-centred thinking is still strong.There’s the positive pull of being American, realised in the election of Barack Obama, symbolically so important for many Americans but especially black Americans. On the negative side, there is the spectre of punishment. Ali was punished, King was murdered, the Black Panthers – who were reading Mao and saw themselves as part of a third world revolution – were violently suppressed. Finally, Obama, Beyoncé, Kanye West, Michael Jordan, and the rest of the black economic, cultural and political elite are international, but not in the radical sense. That’s racial contradiction under a global capitalist economy, when Oprah can be a billionaire and still be racially profiled in a luxury goods store. The liberal-to-moderate-left position is to guarantee that Oprah can be a billionaire without racism, even if many black Americans remain poor (because of both racism and capitalism).In this racialised economy, Black Lives Matter is an idea, a meme, a phrase that can be commodified and contained. Now it’s relatively safe to take a knee, to wear a BLM shirt. Still, the moment feels different from anything I’ve seen in my lifetime. Quantitatively different, too, with the scale of the protests in the US and outside. I’m guardedly optimistic that there has been a shift in thinking about race in the US. And since race cannot be separated from inequality and exploitation, a shift in thinking about race might be a shift in thinking about these interrelated issues. Are you more pessimistic than I am?PM: I think I am wary rather than pessimistic. Perhaps because I see the opposition to BLM’s demand for root-and-branch change as deeply entrenched, among liberals as well as white supremacists. Take, for instance, the insidious Harper’s letter, which complains about something usually called “cancel culture” in the midst of the most devastating global crisis since the second world war and massive protests against racism that you rightly call transformative.You’ll remember that King identified the peddler of “moderation” as the bigger obstacle to social justice than white supremacists. The letter is an example of how elites rush to occupy the moral high ground when their authority as arbiters of intellectual and political life is challenged from both the left and the right. The letter was organised by Thomas Chatterton Williams, a writer much liked by self-proclaimed centrists and moderates as well as rightwingers for his belief that the “root problem in black life” in America is an “intangible smallness of mind” and “moral childishness and sheepish conformity”. Shouting that “free speech” is in danger has become one way to promote yourself as a custodian of “classical liberalism”, and to accrue some moral and intellectual glamour. The problem for this rich, powerful, but deeply insecure minority is that free speech has never been freer for most people on this planet.I can personally attest, after nearly 25 years of publishing in mainstream journals, that intellectual discourse has never been more open and erse. Yes, Niall Ferguson threatened to sue me over a book review, and Jordan Peterson responded to an article by calling me a “prick” whom he would happily beat up but you have to take such moderate exponents of free speech in your stride if you have a public role. The important thing is that many more people of our background are writing today in mainstream periodicals than they were in the mid-1990s, when I started out. Today we can discuss a range of subjects with a frankness that was simply taboo for decades. Moreover, the public sphere is no longer dominated by the so-called legacy media. We tend to focus on the derangements and corruptions of Twitter. But what about the contributions of historians, economists and sociologists on Twitter and in webzines and small periodicals?When in the past you read prescriptions for wars and torture in the Atlantic and the New York Times when the editorial pages of the Financial Times in 2014 said that there is something “thrilling” about the rise of Narendra Modi, you could do nothing except let off an internal scream of impotent despair.Today, such moral obscenities provoke an immediate response. When Roger Cohen, a columnist at the NYT (and a signatory of the open letter), endorsed Modi’s leadership  he faced a tsunami of scorn. When the Economist tells us, with its usual glibness, to deploy “Enlightenment liberalism” against racism, a lot of people can swiftly point out that Voltaire saw black people as only slightly intellectually superior to animals and that Kant thought black people were stupid by nature.Yascha Mounk, the political scientist who ran Tony Blair’s Saudi-funded programme for “renewing the centre”, faced immediate criticism when he hailed a coup in Bolivia as a triumph of democracy. Today, people can see that petulant rearguardism is being desperately passed off as classical liberalism, that the beneficiaries and propagandists of an exclusionary system have dominated, and infantilised, political and intellectual discourse for too long.The figures who once claimed authority and expertise find themselves challenged at last, and they won’t persuade many people by holding up their tattered copies of Voltaire and Kant they are very likely to be told: “Read and think more broadly. Try to learn about other political, literary and philosophical traditions. And don’t forget to take a look at the world you made: it is collapsing around you.” And if they can’t embark on this self-education, they should cede their place to people who are younger, smarter and work harder. For the debacle of a bankrupt intelligentsia and political class is in plain sight. I am not pessimistic, to answer your question, but convinced that very little will change until both are renewed. Unfortunately, the political class is easier to renovate than a resourcefully self-perpetuating intelligentsia.VTN: If you think that the political class is easier to renovate than the intelligentsia, you actually seem a bit optimistic, or maybe your pessimism about the intelligentsia is simply deeper than your pessimism about the political class. I’ve spent nearly three decades in academia and there is barely a radical left there, despite what Trump and conservatives claim. But academia, at least in the humanities and social sciences, does tilt liberal, and the mainstream liberal intelligentsia in academia is defined by the smugness of the Ivy League, so I think you are right there.I’m new to the mainstream media world, and have been lucky to work with sympathetic editors, one of whom told me he is happy to periodically throw some of my socialism at the audience of his very mainstream publication.I was actually invited to sign the Harper’s letter. My gut instinct was to say no, which was compounded by how the person who invited me described the letter as “liberal”. I’m not a liberal, and the refreshing-and-distressing power of social media is that it allows and encourages voices and views that are not liberal. Distressing because really hideous ideas and personalities can flourish there refreshing because the will to speak truth to power is also strong there. Part of what you imply is that what social media allows is the amplification of non-institutional voices and the creation of whole new personalities. In the worst case, they are “influencers” and “thought leaders”, terms that make me shudder and which are completely implicated in the commodification of the idea as a marketable trend – see the TED talk as exemplary of this – parts of platforms and brands, utterly compatible with liberalism, neoliberalism, cosmopolitanism.In the best case, these personalities are actually intellectuals. I go back to Antonio Gramsci’s concept of organic intellectuals: organic seems to be the right word to describe how some people outside of the mainstream have been able to use social media to advance ideas. Of course, Trump is organic at handling Twitter too. Contrast him with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is definitely an organic intellectual at this moment. Whether she remains one or whether she becomes captured by power, we will have to wait and see.What someone like Ocasio-Cortez or Black Lives Matter represents is the faint hope that the US can save itself from its contradictions. You have cited James Baldwin as a figure who called for an American reckoning with its fatal histories of conquest, war, genocide and slavery.Not reckoning with these tragedies has, in your argument, left the UK and the US victims of their own ruthless winner-take-all forms of inidual capitalism. But strong capitalist dictatorial states such as China have their own problems with the unchecked domination of civil society and minority groups. In the face of China’s rise, it might be that the US has three choices: first, to double down on its current strategy of having a multicultural military-industrial complex that emerges out of a racially and class stratified society whose inequalities pay for the complex. Second, to partly give in to BLM demands and force the nation to finally engage in truth and reconciliation, with reparations and economic redistribution drawn from higher taxes on the wealthy and a relatively small reduction in the Pentagon’s budget. Or third, to greatly reduce the military commitment and transform gracefully into a post-imperial power like Germany, one which is better at taking care of its citizens and defending its interests without seeking global domination.The last option seems utopian in an American context. The middle option is the best we could hope for in a Biden presidency, and even that seems utopian, except that now at least the idea of reparations is legitimately being discussed by “thought leaders”. But Biden could just as easily slide back into the first option, which is the one Trump is most ferociously committed to, and which has formed the broad parameters of bipartisan consensus in the US for the past few decades. Recounting all this, I remind myself that I’m mostly just someone who finds great pleasure in writing novels, albeit novels that try to confront some of these dynamics.PM: I suspect these dynamics today point to a treacherous period ahead. The pandemic is still out of control more lives and livelihoods will be devastated. You cannot rule out a ersionary clash with China, only one of Trump’s likely ruses to postpone his eviction from the White House. And a Biden administration will likely consist of too many people who paved the path to Trump. One source of hope in this bleak scenario is what you call the organic intellectuals.They have no establishment credentials, no supporting networks of self-cherishing elites or rightwing moneybags, and are consequently exposed to vicious attacks. Just look at how dementedly and relentlessly Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, two first-time congresswomen, are persecuted today by rightwingers and centrists. But no one should doubt that they are here to stay and to fight and the emancipatory energy released by the BLM protests will fortify them. You can see it working on even older mainstream writers – take, for instance, Hilton Als’ unsparing account of his experiences as a black journalist in a white man’s world. More and more people feel empowered to raise questions they would have not dared to air in the past.Fresh accounts of how we got here and what we can do are needed. Everywhere you see a young and deeply engaged generation ready to provide them, and what stands in their way are the still formidable forces of a discredited status quo.VTN: Instead of one step forward, two steps back, I hope what we are seeing now is two steps forward, one step back. Because there will be a step back, a push back. But at the same time, what is crucial about BLM and the massive protests in the streets worldwide is a change in the imagination. We can’t overestimate the power of symbols, ideas, and words, in enabling people to imagine what was once seemingly impossible. Movements drive politicians, intellectuals and writers, but politicians, intellectuals and writers can drive movements, too. Look at the return of Baldwin as a perfect example of this dynamic process between movements and thinkers, someone compelled to action by the civil rights movement and someone whose words now help us understand our present and justify our struggle for the future. No one worries about whether he is a lesser artist now.For the moment, I choose to hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b70b2ac3d96c385909109de7bffe7e9f33d512/0_47_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d3cf09b4a2cd66705f3d977e961ebb9","title":"sports direct undercover minimum wage mike ashley","story":"Exclusive: Undercover reporter finds warehouse staff unable to leave premises during breaksWarehouse workers at Sports Direct, the retail chain controlled by the billionaire Mike Ashley, appear to be receiving pay below the national minimum wage, according to expert analysis of a new  undercover investigation.The concerns have emerged almost five years after the  first exposed how the retailer was breaching minimum wage law, which resulted in workers receiving about £1m in back pay and Ashley being hauled in front of a parliamentary select committee.MPs concluded that the business – which has now been renamed Frasers Group after Ashley’s acquisition of House of Fraser – had treated “workers as commodities rather than as human beings”, which prompted Sports Direct to review its working practices and pledge to implement a string of improvements in 2016.In the latest investigation, the  placed an undercover reporter inside the same Shirebrook, Derbyshire, warehouse during two weeks in late June and early July, where an estimated 3,000-4,000 workers distribute goods for Frasers Group, the holding company that also includes retailers such as Flannels, Jack Wills and USC.The reporter recorded how warehouse staff at the group were unable to leave the building during their 30-minute unpaid breaks – a practice some employment law experts say should count as paid working time and, if correct, would push Shirebrook’s effective hourly wage rates below the legal minimum of £8.72 to about £8.20.Concerns about how breaks can be taken at the warehouse follows the company reacting to the ’s 2015 investigation by announcing a string of improvements.While the improvements have addressed many of the issues raised five years ago, other problems appear to remain or have re-emerged, raising questions about how firms monitor compliance when they are no longer in the public eye.Following the 2015 investigation, Sports Direct:• Announced it had altered internal systems to prevent workers from being deducted 15 minutes of pay if they clocked on one minute late for work. Workers continue to complain of harsh deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift slightly late or off slightly early.• Said it was considering a trial to transfer 10 warehouse staff a month on temporary agency contracts to permanent deals with the retailer. Had this announcement been enacted, more than 300 additional warehouse workers would now have permanent jobs, but the warehouse remains overwhelmingly staffed by agency workers. Frasers Group said 170 workers had transferred from its agencies “under the test scheme” and that the numbers of agency workers in the warehouse had been cut, although it did not give figures.The law says workers are entitled to spend rest breaks away from their workstation if they have one, and breaks do not generally count as working time and therefore do not have to be paid under national minimum wage law.However, legal experts say that is only the case if a worker is able to spend the break how he or she wishes.Zoe Lagadec, principal at Mulberry’s employment law solicitors, said: “If the workers are not able to use their unpaid rest break freely and for their own purposes, then this time should be deemed working time and should be paid. These workers cannot be said to have taken rest away from their place of work if they are prohibited from leaving the warehouse during their only break during the working day.“Given that the workers are paid only three pence above the national minimum wage, this unpaid period of working time would breach the NMW regulations as the rate would fall below it for the whole relevant period.”Frasers Group said its warehouse workers did not have to be paid for the breaks and that the business had “no rule preventing staff leaving the warehouse during a rest break”.’s undercover reporter asked three separate direct supervisors if he could leave the warehouse during his daily break. All three said this was impossible and that the break should be spent in a staff canteen or on the smoking terrace.HMRC’s national minimum wage manual states that breaks are not typically counted as working time – but that companies should make sure the break is “genuinely taken”.The manual then points businesses to consider a separate regulation that states: “Time where a worker … is not working but is required by their employer to be available at or near a place of work for the purposes of working is treated as working time for national minimum wage purposes, even if the worker is simply waiting to be given work, is ‘on call’ or ‘standby’.“It does not matter whether during such time the employer provides any work for the worker to do, or whether the worker actually performs work. The relevant factors are the employer requiring the presence of the worker at a specified location and time of their choosing and the worker complying with that requirement.”Frasers Group said there was no legal requirement for it to provide separate facilities and, what was key, was that staff did not have to perform any duties or be at the company’s disposal during rest breaks. They said workers were allowed to use their breaks freely and for their own purposes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a97376a7e62cc6c99fe1ade68ac1ab6d2ad8a090/0_109_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a78713b64153b645c1bebbb4c29750ab","title":"labour hmrc investigate sports direct pay minium wage guardian investigation","story":"Move comes after  inquiry suggests firm may be paying below minimum wage Labour’s frontbench is to ask HMRC to investigate pay levels at Sports Direct, after expert analysis of a  undercover investigation suggested the company could be paying below the minimum wage.The move by Andy McDonald, the shadow secretary of state for employment rights, comes after the  returned to the company’s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, five years after a first undercover investigation exposed how workers at the site were being paid less than the national minimum wage.“Sadly, the underpayment of the minimum wage is a widespread problem.

It will take until early 2021 for income to reach even two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels, she predicts and is applying for a £700,000 emergency loan to tide it over.“We applied for a business interruption loan with our bank but didn’t get it because they wanted security, which our council wouldn’t give us,” said Parish. “I employ 343 staff. That’s a lot of staff and livelihoods could be in jeopardy.”She said “we won’t survive” if the loan request was later declined.The UK has about 7,200 gyms and leisure centres, with approximately two-thirds run privately and the rest by councils or operators on their behalf.Before the pandemic 10.4 million people had memberships but some of the large chains have reported losing up to a fifth of their clientele as Britons reined in spending during lockdown.After a frustrating delay – gyms had hoped to reopen alongside England’s pubs and hotels – popular chains such as PureGym, David Lloyd and Virgin Active are champing at the bit despite the financial implications of half empty gyms, smaller exercise classes and expensive cleaning regimes. A date is yet to be set for gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools in Scotland and Wales to open, while facilities in Northern Ireland were allowed to open on 10 July.The sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, said: “Given the huge benefits exercise has for physical and mental health, I know people across the country can’t wait to get back to the gym.“But it’s vital that users feel safe. That’s why we have worked hard with the sector to make sure they have the guidance they need to put strict safety measures in place.”“Fitness is a successful growth business but this has been an enormous shock,” Earlam said. “We have survived four months of closure and we will be fine, providing people come back come back in normal numbers, even if it takes us a while to build back the volume we have lost.”The shift to working from home is also creating opportunities for the upmarket chain, with its spacious centres and free wifi. Several companies have inquired about corporate memberships whereby staff could base themselves at a David Lloyd club.However, there is a concern that nearly half of Britain’s public leisure centres will not be able to stay the course, meaning even those that open their doors in the coming days could be forced to close again.“We have acute cashflow issues and are totally and utterly dependent on support from a council facing its own challenges,” said Chris Rushton, the chief executive of Active Tameside, which runs eight leisure centres in Greater Manchester. “We will open on a vastly restricted capacity and lose money as the furlough scheme winds down.”Rushton added: “Swathes of our sector are at risk. Not everything will reopen, and not everything that opens will be the same as it was previously. We are a sector that is delivering untold health and social impact and that is what is in danger here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab04d493b2acedef51e0e83c46f679703f28380f/149_32_2376_1426/master/2376.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=9d35197412208b367415c7d013e5b668","title":"uk citizenship test arbitrary facts nationalist myth imperialism","story":"There are arbitrary facts aplenty, and lots of nationalist myth-making. But not so much about the ugly legacy of imperialismAlmost 10 years ago to the month, I was a newly qualified junior doctor, working in Oxford’s major teaching hospital, the John Radcliffe. On one of my first on-call shifts, a characteristically busy Saturday evening, I was summoned to the ward by a kindly Filipino nurse. She was distressed about a patient, an elderly man delirious with infection, who was shouting racial slurs at the nursing staff.“How are you feeling today, sir?” I asked with a cheerful, if insincere, lilt.“I’m not arrogant, I’m English, which is more than I can say for you, you black bastard!” he replied with equal buoyancy.I considered a cheeky retort but opted instead for a wry smile and a gentle dose of lorazepam to settle the matter quickly. I scurried away, more patients to see and blood tests to review before handover to the night team.Such encounters had long ceased to rattle me. I arrived in the UK as an international student from Zimbabwe in 2003. After a brief spell at a boarding school in Lancashire to complete my A-levels, I earned a placed at Newcastle University to study medicine. The north-east was unlike anywhere I had lived before. One of sparingly few black faces in the university, I felt like a misplaced peppercorn in a bowl of salt. My first year was especially difficult. The loneliness sank me into a deep depression. I felt fearful that I would never adjust to my new life. All the while, I watched Zimbabwe’s unfolding economic crisis at a distance with feelings of guilt, shame, loss and longing.Over time, things slowly changed. My survival strategy was to mimic the English and downplay other aspects of my identity. As I rotated through clinical placements in Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland and South Shields, I took a keen sociological interest in the geographic inequalities that ide Britain. I learned how to decipher the Geordie accent. I occasionally attempted to greet my patients with affectionate colloquialisms (“You alreet pet?”). I cheered energetically for the Toon Army. I developed a taste for real ale. I made friends, went on many disastrous dates and participated in student politics.I always kept one eye on Zimbabwe and wrestled with my sense of belonging in Britain. Could I ever call this country home when I was frequently reminded of my outsider status? At times, these reminders were aggressive: patients calling me a “golliwog” or drunk partygoers in Newcastle’s Bigg Market instructing me to “fuck off back to Africa”. More typically, these reminders were subtle. People marvelled incredulously at the eloquence of my spoken English. They took liberties when touching my hair. Some casually called me the “whitest black man” they knew. The “only black man” would have been more accurate.After graduation, I worked as a junior doctor in hospitals in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire before a stint in the School of Public Health at Imperial College London. Rather than specialise in a particular area of medicine, I turned my attention to academia. A fortunate recipient of a full scholarship to Oxford University, I studied African history and politics. Towards the end of my PhD, I was offered a faculty job in my department conditional on attaining the right to work. After 16 years, half my life, perhaps it was time to think of the UK as home, and apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR).The application process was costly and anxiety-inducing. My university had awarded me a prestigious writing fellowship to complete my doctoral thesis, but I spent all £3,000 on the ILR application and lawyer fees. I also had to sit the Life in the UK test as one of the requisites for the application.Leaving nothing to chance, I studied like a demon for the test, reading the syllabus repeatedly and doing practice questions online. I crammed the trivia in the handbook: facts about the bronze age, the National Trust and the number of dry ski slopes in Scotland. I gleaned some interesting morsels of information about the structures of government, social struggles for equality such as Chartism and women’s suffrage, and a truncated history of the monarchy. The horrors of colonialism and slavery were unsurprisingly glossed over, incorporated into a triumphalist narrative of Britain as an unequivocal force for good in the world. The combination of arbitrary facts and nationalist myth-making would, under less exigent circumstances, offend me.Test day arrived. Nervous and overprepared, I completed the 45-minute test in four, finishing with a perfect score. I left the examination centre, certificate in hand, and promptly forgot everything I had learned in my preparation. Instead, I reflected on my own journey to this point and lamented how regressive the entire ILR application process is. To be eligible demands adherence to stringent restrictions on travel (you can’t, for example, leave the country for more than 540 days in a 10-year period, even if the travel is work-related). The sheer cost is prohibitive and the Life in the UK test is reductive.Many migrants spend years building their lives in this country, contributing immeasurably to society and developing a textured grasp of the richness and ersity of British life. Unlike me, I suspect the majority do not have the time or resources to memorise a selection of dates and figures that bear little resemblance to daily life. The test can neither authenticate the experience of living in the UK nor meaningfully affirm civic values rather it functions as a signal to the general public that immigrants have been vetted for their loyalty to Britain.As the UK reckons with its history, there are strong grounds for updating the content of the test. A good start would be an even-handed account of how slavery and colonialism shaped the country and the world in profound and destructive ways. This might help to contextualise Britain’s challenges with structural racism and inequality. Better yet, I would suggest more public education on school curriculums about the ugly legacies of imperialism – and scrapping the test altogether.• Simukai Chigudu is associate professor of African politics at the University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f361e76a5d1fe02c1fdf3e1fa8607c8339ac85c2/0_70_3726_2235/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06be0cc7749718242154a5f64ac35ae4","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

The deal is worth €21m (£19.1m) – including the loan fee of €4.5m – and the Czech Republic international has signed a four-year contract.It is likely Soucek would not have stayed had West Ham gone down but the club finalised the transfer after winning their battle against relegation thanks to a 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Wednesday. The 25-year-old has played a crucial role in their push for safety, forming a solid partnership in midfield with Declan Rice and Mark Noble, and is highly regarded by David Moyes.“I’m delighted that Tomas has signed his permanent contract to secure his long-term future,” West Ham’s manager said. “When I came in, we talked about needing another midfield player, to help Declan Rice and Mark Noble, and I think he’s been a really good fit for us.“He’s a terrific lad with very good physical capabilities. He has scored some really important goals for us, against Chelsea, Newcastle and Watford. We’re glad he’s going to be a West Ham player for a good period to come.”Moyes has spoken about the need for West Ham, who are determined to fend off interest from Chelsea in Declan Rice, to target young, hungry players. They are monitoring Queens Park Rangers’ Ryan Manning and Eberechi Eze, Brentford’s Saïd Benrahma and Wigan’s Cédric Kipré and Antonee Robinson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2149dace6fefbab687fca69947c236c332c782a4/0_199_5964_3578/master/5964.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b20786ba4f4195472bf47f03ef288c64","title":"happy to work from home for ever six ways to win over your boss","story":"We’re still delivering on the work front but without the pressures of the daily commute, little wonder so many of us want to hang on to our newly flexible livesBosses used to assume that flexible working meant their employees were watching daytime TV and sending the odd “reply all” email to look busy. Then, coronavirus arrived and working from home became vital to keeping many businesses afloat.So, how can you convince your employer to make flexible working the new normal? Here’s the evidence you need …Working from home worksA global pandemic is nobody’s idea of a perfect backdrop for a major change in working practices, but in spite of the obstacles, millions of office workers have transformed into home workers and our jobs are still getting done. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has even told his 5,000 employees they can choose to work at home forever. “We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” explained a spokesperson. Bhutta isn’t surprised. “OK, we didn’t choose this situation,” she says. “But flexibility is clearly available in many more jobs than had been advertised on that basis. We need employers to ask themselves, has there really been a significant drop in productivity? I think they’ll find employees have been doing their best in very challenging circumstances.”People are working smarterA huge amount of time during the office working day is wasted on interruptions and unnecessary meetings. “We all know the stress of presenteeism, of having to sit in a meeting room for an hour while someone drones on – it drains activity,” says Tracey Follows, founder of the strategy consultancy Futuremade. “Working from home allows you to take control of how and when you use your energy,” she says. This in turn can lead to increased efficiency.It makes employees happy You want to jump on a video call from the park? Download documents at the beach? Thanks to Vodafone’s unlimited data, you can. Helping employees to achieve a better work-life balance is an obvious way to support them and encourage their loyalty. “Flexible working means the employer gets an engaged, happy employee who is able to concentrate on their job while they’re working because they can also plan for the school pick-up or to visit elderly relatives,” says Bhutta. “When people have autonomy they are loyal and committed, which leads to benefits in terms of productivity.”The traditional office is outdatedOne look at the deserted skyscrapers in our cities shows that it’s time to retire any romantic attachment to Mad Men-style central offices. Especially now that screen partitions between desks, regular deep cleaning and one-way traffic systems will need to be implemented to help prevent future waves of coronavirus. Offices could well transform into occasional spaces where people meet for training days or to collaborate on projects. Even the CEO of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, has acknowledged that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past”. While, sadly, this might signal the end of the office biscuit tin, it could save employers hundreds of millions pounds in annual office costs.Businesses can access more talentSaying goodbye to the traditional office means an opportunity to welcome in new staff, talent and ideas from all over the world. “Flexibility opens up the workforce to many more people,” says Follows. “It gives opportunities for talented people who live far from big cities, who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have disabilities. It’s an opportunity to be grasped.”Employers get to be human tooDuring this crisis, thanks to all the video meetings, we’ve got to know our colleagues and bosses as actual people who have overloaded bookshelves, home schooled kids and cute puppies in their lives. Employers have become relatable, not just an intimidating presence at board meetings. “Seeing people’s kids and dogs popping up on video calls has meant that people’s responsibilities have become visible in the world of work, in a way that they weren’t before,” says Bhutta. “It’s been a real opportunity to see people beyond their role at work. And that’s something we don’t want to turn the clock back on.”From uninterrupted video meetings to deciding when and where you work best, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

And it’s a trend that’s set to continueIt doesn’t take a statistician to work out that we’ve all been online a lot in the last few months. From home schooling and streaming to ensuring your household has all the essentials (which may or may not have been purchased from Deliveroo), the number of gigabytes we’ve used and the time we’ve spent online has ticked ever upwards.But exactly how much more are we online now? What’s using up most of our data? And what will happen as lockdown ends? Turns out it does take statisticians to work all that out – which is why we’ve looked at their reports to compile this list of five facts about you, the internet and your data usage. You’re welcome.1. In lockdown, we’ve each been online for four hours and two minutes a dayYou always knew you had it in you to be a record breaker, didn’t you? You were right. According to Ofcom’s new Online Nation 2020 report, an annual survey looking at how the UK’s internet usage is changing, the four hours and two minutes we’ve averaged online during lockdown is a new high. And it’s an increase of 37 minutes a day per online adult compared with January 2020.Even without lockdown, we’ve been using the internet more than ever before. In the past year before we were locked down, we were online for 17 minutes a day more than the previous year. The biggest users? 18 to 24 year olds, who logged on for an hour more each day than adults overall.“That’s one of the more interesting stats that we found,” says Jory MacKay, RescueTime’s marketing manager. “This means that essentially each time you look at your phone you’ve got a 5050 chance of setting off a chain reaction of phone check ins.”5. Why unlimited data deals are great for familiesYou know that feeling when your work Zoom call’s audio goes so robotic and stuttery it’s like a Daft Punk remix? And on investigation, it turns out that the rest of your household is variously streaming video, online gaming and generally draining so much of your bandwidth that they might as well have attached a tap and be dispensing pints of it in the street?“As households are doing their learning, communicating, streaming – everything – online, that puts more pressure on the home internet,” says Gilani. “One answer is to have your own separate connection – whether through your phone or a dedicated mobile broadband connection – which means you can do what you need to do without interrupting what the rest of the family does. You can then get on with client calls while another family member is playing Fortnite.” In a pandemic, these are good problems to have.Staying connected has never been more vital – and it often seems that everyone in the family wants to be online at the same time.

But despite our physical distance, Luke, who’s 23, and I are closer than ever. These extraordinary times have meant we can really focus on getting to know each other at a deeper level. He makes me feel good and takes me away from the mundanity of every day. We’ve had the time and space to really talk about what’s important to us and best of all we make each other laugh.In early lockdown we’d FaceTime from the moment we woke up to when we went to sleep. I’d walk around the house with him in my hand Mum got totally used to him being here with us and has got to know him too. We’d even have date nights watching the same film on Netflix from our bedrooms.More recently we’ve made our first tentative steps into the outside world together, albeit still being physically apart. We have to take things slowly as I’m still shielding but I have driven over and had a barbecue with his family in his garden, even if I do take my own chair and plate and cutlery to be safe.We are taking it a day at a time but for now, I’m so relieved he is always by my side thanks to our phones.‘My friendships mean more to me than ever’ Carrie, 14, MacclesfieldFriendship has become even more important since March. I speak to my best friend Yaz most days and if I didn’t have her I don’t know what I’d do. We just get each other.I get on really well with my family but you talk to friends in a different way. I’ve used my phone more since lockdown than ever before. But when you’ve suddenly had all your freedom taken away it’s hardly surprising. I spend hours chatting on social media or FaceTime. Some days I look back and see I’ve been on my phone for eight hours.Before lockdown hit I loved my own space. I’m a keen mountain biker so I’d be out in the woods with friends or hanging out at mates’ houses, or a coffee shop.Now lockdown has eased, I’m out and about more so I use a lot of data. I go mountain biking and while there are more people on the trails we always do our best to socially distance. I like to meet friends in the park or go to a place nearby to wild swim. I always have my phone to reassure my mum I’m safe.But I miss socialising without having to think so carefully about it. I never thought I’d say it, but I can’t wait to go back to school.An unexpected bonus of this year is I’m getting on really well with my brother Dan, who’s 18. We used to bicker but now we really talk to each other. The other day he even invited me to join his friends around the firepit in the garden.‘I’m finally getting some freedom back’George, 21, Bishop SuttonThe second year of university is known as the party year, you’re in the swing of student life, there are no exams and just plenty of socialising and nights out. So I never imagined I’d be driving back to my family home at 1am on a March morning, as lockdown hit, and then spending the majority of the year back in my childhood bedroom. It has been hard to take, as up until March, I hadn’t spent more than three weeks consecutively at home since finishing my A-levels. On the plus side, I have enjoyed being close with my family again.I’m studying modern languages at the University of Oxford and suddenly my academic world has been taken completely online with seminars and tutorials. It has definitely been a challenge getting used to a new normal but I’m trying to remain positive.One benefit has been changing the way I work. When I was at uni it was like we were always working, doing snippets here and there. But now I’ve learned to work more intensely and so I get the work done faster. It means I have more free time.While I’m not seeing much of my uni friends I’m finally able to get out and catch up with local friends. We’ve met up for fish and chips near a local lake and have enjoyed river swims and socially distanced drinks at the harbourside. When the weather is good, life almost feels normal again as we sit in parks and chill together.But we can’t be spontaneous any more, we actually have to plan to meet up. In the old days we would just float around town and see who was around. I’m certainly more reliant on my phone and it’s useful having unlimited data. I’m used to crashing at a friend’s house if I’m visiting but now I have to think about getting home instead.It’s my year abroad next year and I’m lucky as I have got a job and am heading to Berlin. For those who are staying here, university is going to feel very different.When you can’t see the people you care about as much as you’d like, staying connected is more important than ever.

My childhood cat died when I was 26. She was born on my sixth birthday, and I hadn’t lived with her since I was 18, but once she had gone I still felt a void. Every now and again, I would investigate the possibility of getting a new cat, even once trekking to see a litter of kittens. But my life felt makeshift, transitory. I was always looking ahead to someplace in the future: a stable set-up, a place that was mine. That was the holy grail. In desiring it, I never really looked around at what I had.Then the pandemic hit and suddenly, for the first time in years, it was just me and my husband, with no pressure to fill the room. I looked around the shabby flat and, beyond the hideous woodchip wallpaper and scuffed skirting boards I was surprised to find a life. Not some inadequate, ephemeral, ersatz life made bearable by the thought of some stable, glittering future, but an actual life, that I was living right now. Crises have a tendency to do that to you – they make you take stock. I started looking for a kitten.Because of lockdown, kittens were in high demand. You’re not supposed to leave a kitten alone for more than a few hours, but with more people working from home, perhaps people were taking advantage. Eventually, thanks to a woman on Twitter, I found one, and she needed a new home that Saturday. I cried until my husband said yes. (“What do we do when we go on holiday?” he had asked. “There is a global pandemic. We’re in lockdown. We’re not going anywhere,” I said.)We walked 12 miles to collect and bring her home. About halfway there, the heavens opened and the kitten began to meow in loud protest. We took shelter and ate our sandwiches on a bench under a large, bushy tree, watching the rain while the kitten drifted off to sleep in her carry case. Suddenly, there were three of us. We named her Mackerel, because we thought it was funny to name a cat after a fish. The colours in her fur are like a mackerel sky.I can’t believe I waited so long under the false assumption that my life wasn’t stable or good enough to give a pet a loving environment (is it possible to have low life esteem? If so, I think I had it). The psychotherapist Esther Perel has spoken about how we can reframe self-isolation, as “cocooning” for safety – to make us feel differently about our experience of lockdown. The pandemic taught me that we had built ourselves a cocoon, a beautiful garden, a marriage and, yes, a life, from scratch. I couldn’t say that I “owned” any of it, but why had I put so much stock in ownership in the first place? Now I live with a cat, and I can’t be said to own her, either. She owns us. And we’re fine with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99607e9b3de30b5f1b3ff6666e4498561ff10b05/0_0_5347_3206/master/5347.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4a408396c2f44a8a91b2f2f9e6d1988a","title":"take a chance turn on shuffle jackpot","story":"Shuffle is the cousin of a DJ dropping a bangerMost people have favourite songs, and the majority of the time we hear them by our own hand. For the most part, I don’t agree with the sentiment that one can play a loved song too much and ruin it. I have a rapacious attitude to things I take great pleasure in, and though we can fall out of love with things and people, it is rare for me to get sick of a song. (Conversely, I do believe in the power of the grower.)Songs become favourites for various reasons. Perhaps a track is tied to a memory. Sometimes it is the craft of a near-perfect work. Maybe it is impossible not to dance to. People have favourites that might not induce happiness, but provide some other emotional release. It’s possible the lyrics are extremely relatable. Frequently, it is a combination.With the advent of new technologies, many of us listen to music in a medium that would have been unrecognisable not long ago. There is a healthier market for records than one might expect, due to a sort of faux nostalgia from young people who were not around for their heyday, but cassettes are shunned even by charity shop bargain bins. MiniDiscs (lol) and the cracked jewel cases of CDs are, for most of us, no more. Streaming rules I am not sure gen Z would understand “MP3”.But the feature that has transformed us most as listeners is shuffle. A favourite track coming up on shuffle is the roulette ball landing on the correct number – but as if someone else had chosen it for you. Shuffle is the cousin of a DJ dropping a banger. I really don’t want to say that people “throw their hands in the air like they just don’t care”, but, well, they do. Now we can have that similar unexpected joy via earbuds on the commute to work, or when sweating on a treadmill, providing an extra kick of energy.Sometimes a good shuffle isn’t as random as it might seem: algorithms pick up on the songs we appreciate most, and, like a dog being trained, the shuffle alters its behaviour accordingly. It isn’t that a song’s sudden hello hasn’t thrown me into the past and elicited stealthy tears (I don’t want to talk about it), or a song I hate hasn’t sneaked its way in when I’m listening to a suggested playlist.But turning on shuffle is worth the risk: to hear the opening thrum of a classic that makes the heart beat faster, your smile grow wider and a shiver run down the spine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c68c600223f9f64332bed2c87ba204040e3fbcd/123_177_4161_2496/master/4161.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=08e47b52bc4a44b0e227e2ace29d529c 1760w","title":"dolly parton and jolenes enduring legacy raye","story":"Why modern pop stars such as Katy B and Raye are still using the ‘other woman’ trope from the country legend’s 1973 classicOf the quirkiest pop tropes, such as saying hello from the other side, being the baaaad guy and, of course, there being absolutely no party like an S Club party, one in particular stands out by dint of its brutality: begging a tarty woman to stop shagging your boyfriend. The most enduring example is Jolene, where Dolly Parton pleads with an auburn-haired, green-eyed mistress not to toy with her lover any further. It’s a time-honoured tale that south London’s Raye name-checks, updates and shakes firmly by the gingham-clad shoulders on her new single, Natalie Don’t.Although pop has long prided itself on its willingness to uplift other women – see Destiny’s Child, Katy Perry in Firework-mode and Taylor Swift eagerly recruiting new members of her squad for proof – there is one notable exception when it comes to not criticising your sisters, and that’s when one of them is trying to steal your man.  In 2018, Stormzy donned his best fluffy pink Stetson to pick apart Jolene’s troubling narrative on Twitter, nailing the reasons why the 46-year-old song still resonates harder than a Dear Deidre letter: because, although we feel for Dolly, and we all know the real wrong’ un in this situation is the man, we also can’t quite shake the feeling we all know a Jolene. “Kinda sad actually, wish Dolly had more self-love and confidence or the strength to just leave my man cah it ain’t really Jolene’s fault,” wrote Stormzy, “but then again Jolene knows exactly what she’s doing the lil jezzy.”While Dolly’s desperate way of trying to bat off Jolene is by killing her with kindness and reminding her that she’s so fine she can have her pick of small mountain-town hunks, Raye takes a stauncher approach to getting shot of the other woman. “When you bend over like that  You know his eyes gon’ follow,” she sighs over moody Blade Runner synths, swapping Parton’s indelible sadness for a more straight-up “don’t be a dick, hun” attitude. “Natalie, please feel bad  Don’t text back, leave my man,” reasons Raye, not unreasonably.Natalie Don’t’s sassy roots can be found in Katy B and Jessie Ware’s 2012 2-step tale of cheating, Aaliyah, the two women trading bars that suggest that this boyfriend-stealer should watch her back: “With every move you make  You know you’ve got him transfixed  But you can’t get past me, Aaliyah.”But whether it’s Dolly, Raye, Katy B or Jessie Ware’s heartache we’re dealing with, there’s a simple solution to such flagrant adultery. Rather than hoping the third wheel will eventually roll out of the way, calmly follow the advice in Carrie Underwood’s acceptably aggy 2005 anthem Before He Cheats: dump him and then smash up his car. Easy.

Prof Sarah Walker, who works on the survey at the University of Oxford’s Nuffield department of medicine, said the numbers were consistent with no change or an uptick in cases, and that more data were needed to clarify the picture.Separately, the government published its latest estimates of the R number which reflects the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to. In England, R stands at 0.8 to 1, meaning that the epidemic is stable and potentially in decline. As the quest for a coronavirus vaccine continues, a UK-based endeavour has announced it is expanding testing in humans.The Imperial College vaccine, developed by Prof Robin Shattock and his team, has yielded promising results in mice, and has so far been given to 92 people, and counting, out of a cohort of 120 at a west London facility.Now the team have announced the trial is to expand to cover a further 200 adults aged 18-75 across six additional sites, including Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, St George’s University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and University College London NHS Foundation Trust. Each participant will be given two immunisations, four weeks apart.The early results from pre-clinical data have been promising, and the expansion of our trial to additional centres will provide further data on the safety of the vaccine, and the immune response.The Imperial vaccine involves introducing into the body fat droplets containing the genetic instructions, or messenger RNA, that gives rise to the virus’s spike proteins – proteins found on the surface of the virus that help it to enter our cells. The vaccine is designed to trigger the production of these spike proteins by the body’s own cells. The team hope this will stimulate an immune reaction so that, should the body subsequently encounter the virus itself, it will be primed to fight it off.The Imperial vaccine is one of many currently under development around the world. In promising news this week a vaccine developed by a team at the University of Oxford was shown to trigger an immune response. This vaccine takes a different tack to the Imperial approach, incorporating the genetic instructions for the coronavirus spike protein into a harmless, non-replicating adenovirus.But despite the positive news, there is a long way to go before a coronavirus vaccine is available: as experts have pointed out, it remains unclear what immune responses to these vaccines mean for immunity, how long any protection would last, and whether the vaccines will bring the same level of protection to older people as younger ones.In the UK at least, it seems the government is hedging its bets. This week it was announced it is aiming to secure stocks of up to 12 different vaccines.Boris Johnson has urged the public to get a winter flu jab, saying it will help to protect the NHS.The prime minister spoke as he promoted the expansion of the flu vaccination programme across England, in which up to 30 million people could receive the jab.The government is aiming to double its winter flu vaccination programme, with free jabs for those aged 50 and over and 11-year-olds. This is on top of at-risk groups such as people with asthma, heart disease and diabetes, and anyone living with somebody on the Covid-19 shielded list.We want everybody to get a flu jab in the run-up to this winter and that’s why we’re rolling out the biggest-ever programme of flu immunisation.And we’re aiming first of all for schoolchildren up to year seven, for pregnant women, for people over 65, for people who are shielded, but then we will be extending it to people who are 50 to 65.Now the reason for doing this is to protect the NHS in the winter months because obviously we have still got Covid, we have still got the threat of a second spike on Covid, and it’s vital therefore to keep that pressure off the NHS by everybody getting a flu jab and I really hope everybody will.The British Medical Association said the expanded flu vaccination programme is “sensible given the current health climate” but said the government will need to “ensure vaccination supplies reach practices quickly and in sufficient quantities”.Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, also welcomed the move but added: It is likely that Covid-19 will present challenges to delivering the flu programme. We will need to take measures to ensure all patients are safe when they come to get their vaccination, and we will need to ensure people, particularly in at risk groups, are confident in doing so. If a Covid-19 vaccination is available for use then this will also need to be factored in.This morning, Dr Dylan Watkins, a GP in Totnes, Devon, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme his practice would struggle to administer the extra jabs.The concern is that for our practice we’ve got 15,000 patients and the addition of the cohort of patients in the 50 to 64-year-old age group is going to approximately double the number of flu vaccines we’re going to be asked to provide this year. (This is) at a time when we’re going to struggle to administer the vaccines effectively because of coronavirus limitations and we reckon with five clinical rooms running - each with administration staff with a nurse or doctor - that in a day we could probably administer 420 vaccines safely, according to the current guidelines. Add in an extra 2,000 patients for us that fall into this age category.Let’s estimate, maybe half of them might decide to have a flu vaccine this year ... we’re looking at the full two days’ extra work while we’re also trying to play catch up on the clinical work we’ve been missing because of the coronavirus situation.He said it is a “huge guess” how many vaccines will be needed and who will take them up, adding 2,000 extra vaccines “sat in the fridge gone off” would cost £15,000.Scottish football club St Mirren is now in lockdown after seven coaches and backroom staff tested positive for Covid-19.Following the news, Scottish Premiership clubs have been ordered to revert to two Covid tests per week rather than one.Meanwhile, it has also been reported that Rangers faces a probe by the Scottish Football Association into whether the club breached testing protocols as it emerged that as many as nine of Steven Gerrard’s first team squad played against Dundee United on Wednesday without having been given the mandatory all clear in time.The SFA has emphasised the importance of sticking to new testing and hygiene procedures ahead of the new season kicking off on 1 August.My colleague Jason Rodrigues has been on Oxford Street this morning in London, where enforcement of England’s new face coverings rule has been “patchy” and “surprisingly casual”. Major high street names including Sainsbury’s, Asda and Co-Op have said they will not enforce a new law making the wearing of face masks compulsory in shops in England, my colleague Zoe Wood reports.The new rule carries a £100 fine for non-compliance. Police leaders are urging shops to refuse entry to people not wearing face coverings after the high street chains said they will not penalise customers who fail to do so.Jo Whitfield, the chief executive of the Co-op, which has 2,600 grocery stores, said staff – who already received abuse from shoppers on a daily basis – would not challenge people who refused to toe the line.We’ll have in-store signage on the new rules around face coverings but we are clear that shop workers should not enforce the new legislation.On a daily basis they face abuse, threatening behaviour and even physical assault. Our own figures show that during the Covid-19 crisis such instances have risen and enforcing the wearing of face masks could be another flashpoint.Sainsbury’s also tweeted that staff wouldn’t be challenging customers without a mask as they could be medically exempt:Earlier this morning, the care minister Helen Whately told BBC Breakfast she doesn’t believe enforcement from the police will be needed to ensure people wear face coverings.She also told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that some people are exempt from the regulations due to health conditions and she expected people to be “reasonable” about this. What we are saying is that we are not expecting people to carry proof that they are exempt. There are some people who are exempt from this. We are expecting people to be reasonable about this. And we don’t want to see members of the public accosted for not wearing a face mask. We absolutely want the vast majority of people to be wearing face masks when they are going into shops.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has updated its list of countries and territories exempt from advice against “all but essential” international travel.

You can find that list here.Boris Johnson has said people opposed to vaccinations are “nuts” as he promotes an expanded programme of flu jabs that ministers hope will ease pressure on the NHS if there is a second wave of coronavirus this winter.It comes after several polls have suggested some Britons are feeling apprehensive about having a Covid-19 vaccine. A coronavirus jab is seen by many experts as a key route out of the pandemic. Last year, the World Health Organization identified “vaccine hesitancy” as one of the top 10 health threats to the world.Our political correspondent Peter Walker reports that the prime minister added that while he was worried about a second wave of Covid-19, he believed the UK would be through the crisis by mid-2021.The government is to expand the usual winter programme of free flu vaccinations this year to everyone over 50 in an attempt to reduce the level of flu infections and prevent the NHS potentially becoming overwhelmed if coronavirus returns more significantly.You can read the full story here.In the Liverpool One shopping complex on Friday, signs telling customers to wear masks were up in many of the stores and a vending machine selling face coverings had been installed, PA Media reports.The machine had packs of five three-ply masks for £4.75, packets of two for £1.95 or fashion coverings for £5.95.Susan Green, 57, from Liverpool, was wearing a clear visor, which she had bought from a nearby shop, as she waited for HMV to open. She told PA: I think it is a little bit late to have introduced this and lots of people I’ve seen this morning are not even wearing one. It won’t put me off coming to the shops because I’ll be out anyway but it does seem a bit unnecessary.Another shopper, Judith Molloy, 72, from St Helens, was wearing a mask as she did some shopping in Liverpool One but said she had started using a face covering to go to the shops some time ago.I’m vulnerable and so is my husband. I think this should have started from day one. I was on the bus this morning and people were getting on with no masks. If you go into a shop without a mask I don’t think anyone is going to say anything. I think people are more relaxed now.Loryn Fortune, a trainee department manager at the clothing store \u0026amp Other Stories in Liverpool One, said people would not be asked to leave their shop if they weren’t wearing a face covering.We have signage on the window, we’ve got signage up as you enter the shop and then it’s just a polite nudge from us at the door. We can’t enforce it and we don’t want to cause a big scene so we’ll just politely remind people. We’re also aware that people have invisible illnesses.She said customers had been cooperative since the store reopened post-lockdown and around half of shoppers were already wearing coverings before today’s tighter guidance was introduced.I’m sure we’ll have a few people who won’t want to wear them but I’m hoping people realise they have got to look after each other and not just themselves.Good morning!

You’ve got people not getting their passports on time, their birth certificates, huge problems of backlogs, cases not going through the courts fast enough.That’s something that I think that we as a country, with the fantastic civil servants that we have, now that’s something that we should really be bending our wills to solving.I want to see a massive effort now by the country to psychologically, to stop thinking of coronavirus as something that makes it impossible to do things and start really looking at tackling the problems of the British people – how to get the things that they want in double time.So that’s why we’ve set up Project Speed. So one of the things I’ve learnt is sometimes government can be slow and unresponsive and sometimes we need to go faster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d813de2a65c229a6efb1e610e8ecb4fa1ccb199f/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc07f2929c8e1db499aa31ca63065b4","title":"wave of silence spread around world during coronavirus pandemic","story":"An unprecedented wave of silence spread around the world in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, according to researchers who found that vibrations from human activity slumped under national lockdowns.“You can almost see it as a wave,” said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist who worked on the study at Imperial College, London. “You can see the seismic quietening spread over time, starting in China in late January and then moving on to Italy and beyond in March and April.”The scientists analysed traces from a network of 268 seismic sensors in 117 countries and found substantial falls in human-generated noise in 185 of them. The largest drops were seen in busy urban centres such as New York and Singapore, but even remote stations in Germany’s Black Forest and in Rundu, Namibia, fell quieter as human activity was curtailed.“The quietening is unprecedented, at least as far as we can go back in time with continuous seismic data,” said Thomas Lecocq, first author on the study at the Royal Observatory in Belgium. Digital records of seismic activity exist from the 1970s, but paper records go back further.The findings, reported in Science, reveal that vibrations from human activity spread further than scientists expected, reaching seismometers in remote outposts or installed deep underground. “We normally try to put seismometers in quiet places, but this shows that it’s hard to get away from the noise,” said Hicks.For researchers, the sudden global quietening presents an unexpected opportunity. As the global population grows and cities swell, more people are at risk from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides driven by the geology that lies beneath them. Human activity increasingly masks the weak seismic waves that indicate slippage on geological fault lines, or early rumblings in a volcano, but during lockdown, such signals are easier to spot.“It’s important to see those small signals because it tells you if a geological fault, for example, is releasing its stress in lots of small earthquakes or if it’s silent and the stress is building up over the longer term,” said Hicks. “It tells you how the fault is behaving.”Without the human hum to overwhelm them, seismologists can more easily spot “micro-earthquakes” driven by incremental slippage along geological faults. Once they have recorded a quake from a particular fault, they can use the “fingerprint” of the tremor to look back over archived records and see if the fault has slipped before. The same goes for monitoring volcanoes near urban centres.“In cities with geological hazards, such as earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, we want to monitor and maybe get a warning of what’s going on. But with human noise increasing, it’ll become increasingly hard to see those small signals,” Hicks said. “We’re hoping this will spawn a whole new set of studies in this new field of human noise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5517ba601fbd185e89a836425864983b26a0289e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5123e53c6b3194408405d797cdece4e","title":"public sector workers in england share your thoughts about the new pay rise","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers, doctors and other public sector workers about their thoughts on the pay increaseAlmost 900,000 doctors, police, teachers and other public sector workers in England will receive above-inflation pay rises to reflect the “vital contribution” they make.Labour and trade unions welcomed the move, announced by the Treasury, but warned that the increases would not make up for lost incomes under the previous public sector pay freeze.

This year’s Derby took place a month later than normal due to the coronavirus lockdown, and without the usual crowd of more than 100,000 spectators that regularly congregates on the Surrey downs to watch the world’s most famous Classic.The Oaks took place on the same afternoon, while the Coronation Cup was staged at Newmarket in early June. The unexpected news of Investec’s departure leaves three of British racing’s Classic events without a sponsor, as the St Leger at Doncaster is also unsponsored at present. Jockey Club Racecourses has some time to find a new supporter for its most famous Flat race as the next running is just over 10 months away, but in a deeply uncertain economic and social climate, it could be a very difficult task to find a sponsor to match the one it has lost.Investec’s decision to pull out of its Derby sponsorship came out of the blue and arrives at a time when racing continues to struggle with extreme financial pressures after an 11-week shutdown during the coronavirus pandemic, and amid the ongoing requirement to race behind closed doors.The sport has also failed to sign an extension to ITV’s exclusive four-year contract for terrestrial coverage, which runs out at the end of December. The Derby is one of the four “Crown Jewel” events, along with the Cheltenham Festival, the Grand National and Royal Ascot, included in the deal, but the line coming out of Jockey Club Racecourses on Friday morning is that Investec’s abrupt departure is not linked to the continuing uncertainty over the ITV deal.Instead, the suggestion is that Investec’s decision reflects a desire on the Jockey Club’s part to find a lead sponsor that is fully committed to the Derby now that Investec’s global marketing strategy has changed.That implies that Investec has paid up at least part of the outstanding contract to release itself from the sponsorship, as the firm’s decision to pull out has not come as part of a “break” clause in the deal.As for today’s racing, Al Rufaa (1.10) will take some stopping back on turf at Newmarket after a wide-margin success in a first-time hood at Kempton 11 days ago. John Gosden’s colt is bred to win Classics and showed a striking turn of foot to go clear last time out, while stopping the clock in a time that suggests he was full value for the margin of just under five lengths.Nugget (2.15) also looks very solid a couple of races later. Richard Hannon’s colt was second in a strong time at Windsor 11 days ago behind an opponent who saved every possible inch of ground against the rail. This is his last chance to race off 87 before going up 5lb for that run and he should make it a winning one.Darain (2.50) is too short to back but is worth looking out for with an eye to the future, as he was the most expensive yearling sold at auction anywhere in the world in 2018 and looked like he might recoup at least a portion of his 3.5m guineas price tag when he bolted up on his belated debut at Newbury earlier this month. Grand Bazaar (3.55) also has an obvious chance on the same card, while Kentuckyconnection (1.50) and Le Chiffre (2.25) have big claims at Beverley."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5abba159594cb1990a0e0558b1ca4d6e286d3f10/0_18_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5344b764e7b0a5e4e4181956f0505088","title":"sliding home baseball in colour in pictures","story":"As the 2020 season finally gets under way, we take a look back in time, courtesy of the work of artist Mark Truelove and his fantastic colorised vintage baseball photographs"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a01ce9ca9502f5585244517641209b7672d26bbe/276_102_2090_1253/master/2090.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f30a7103a5b2b13adc5fe5004112e9c","title":"theatre artists fund sam mendes freelancers coronavirus","story":"Money will help freelancers affected by coronavirus as experts warn of worker exodus A fund set up by 1917 director Sam Mendes to help theatre freelancers hit by the impact of Covid-19 has raised £1.6m, but industry figures have said more support is needed to avoid an exodus of workers from the sector.The Theatre Artists Fund, which was launched at the start of July with a £500,000 donation from Netflix, has had more than 4,000 applications in less than a month and will provide one-off grants of £1,000.“This fund has enabled us to move fast in response to the urgent need that is out there,” Mendes said. “However, I urge other studios, streaming platforms, business owners, philanthropists and theatre lovers to come forward and show their support in order to help more of those in need.”Julian Bird, chief executive of Solt and UK Theatre, said until details were shared about how the government’s £1.57bn investment package would be distributed and the industry had a date that theatres could reopen fully, thousands of freelancers would continue to have no way to make money.He said: “In lieu of details on how the investment package will be disseminated, we need to raise a lot more money and we need to do it fast, if we are to encourage people to stay in their professions and not abandon this wonderful sector.”The fund said that despite the news that indoor performances could resume with physically distanced audiences from 1 August, staff and freelancers remained in limbo because it would not be economically viable for many theatres to reopen while adhering to the new guidelines.Bird called for more clarity from the government, which has been heavily criticised by parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee this week over its handling of the coronavirus crisis, with MPs saying its support came too late and its guidance had been too vague.“Unfortunately a proposed review in November of social distancing for the whole economy almost certainly means that it will be too late for the major Christmas pantos and shows,” Bird said. “We need a ‘no earlier than’ date now to allow theatres and producers to plan properly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c15da4c12af6370237c55562eef03df37af3873/720_452_4009_2406/master/4009.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=019494c664ec0318aecfcf2eac03cd8f","title":"out to play summer weeks best art shows kapoor activities street food","story":"From Kapoor and kayaking to a theme park and National Trust houses, here’s our weekly pick of attractions and events The latest show by the artist known for his large-scale abstract sculptures includes the famous five-metre-high dish-shaped Sky Mirror, and a series of anatomically influenced pieces, called Grace, Liver and Sophia, carved from pink marble.

The author and cultural commentator Roxane Gay described the decision as “weird, counterproductive and stupid. It diminishes the effort to actually end racism. It’s just so dumb.” The author Sathnam Sanghera echoed this sentiment, describing the “panic-erasing” of British television programmes such as The Mighty Boosh as “idiotic”, arguing that it would “make the deep concern behind BLM seem like political correctness”.However, despite the unpopularity of such removals among many people of colour, rather than, say, adding a content warning as has been done with Gone With the Wind, the idea of “ironic racism” was once again at the forefront of the cultural conversation. Actors and comedians performing racist tropes from a “liberal” perspective seemed more problematic than ever, and the idea that a creator cannot be racist if their work is made ironically, is naive at best and dangerous at worst. The comedian Gina Yashere recently posted a video on Instagram to denounce that particular defence, making clear that these racist depictions are taken as face-value racist entertainment by many: “What happens is these white actors and white creators bringing back blackface pretend it’s ironic: ‘Oh, it’s just characters, I just want to play characters.’ You’re making a fool of black people for your own audiences, because you know these shows are not made for us, they’re made for white people.”The stagecraft of ironic racism is one that invites a nominally well-educated and bourgeois audience to ridicule and belittle the apparently inherent racism of less well-educated, working-class and socially marginalised groups. This allows comedians and actors to “safely” perform absurd racist tropes through the malicious deception of an actually racist audience, therefore creating distance between artist and artwork. The logic follows that the scriptwriter, producer or actor cannot be a “racist” or participating in “racism” themselves if their work is being used to draw out the racism of a sub-class of citizens, an uneducated constituency who are the only people who could be truly capable of racism.In the US, the comics Tina Fey, Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman have found themselves in the line of fire for performances which many believe perpetuate racism via “meta” disparagement. Episodes from Fey’s NBC comedy 30 Rock that featured four incidents of characters in blackface have been permanently pulled from circulation, inspiring broader scrutiny of her reliance on ironic racism. Her depiction of Asian characters in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Mean Girls was also criticised by the likes of Vox’s Alex Abad-Santos, who pointed out a recurring theme: “The underlying ‘joke’ is that they’re hypersexual and looking for green cardscan’t speak English.”Similarly, Little Britain was once again critiqued for its strains of classism, misogyny and homophobia as well as racism. Marjorie Dawes, the overbearing organiser of the Fat Fighters weight-loss class who repeatedly and intentionally misunderstands the accent of Indian character Meera, and ridicules other members of the group for their weight, is an example of at least two forms of prejudice. For many, it was now clear that the distance between Matt Lucas, who portrays Dawes, and his colleague David Walliams – both educated, middle class and white – was uncomfortably far from their creations. Often this was even presented as them “making light” of the out-of-touch, traditionalist pensioners such as Walliams’s character Maggie Blackmoor, who projectile vomits when she eats food made by a homosexual or ethnic minority, serving as a superficial pastiche of other quaint television icons such Keeping Up Appearances’ Hyacinth Bucket.But, for many, the joke never moved beyond replicating racism and homophobia. Clive Nwonka, a fellow in film studies at LSE, described this kind of comedy to me as “hyper-racial contrivance”. “Performers will defend their racist portrayals, or their mimicking and mockery of black and Asian iniduals by insisting that the characterisation is so hyper-contrived and unrealistic that the audience, which crucially is primarily white, will somehow recognise the absurdity and irony of the characterisation,” he says. The idea might be, therefore, for viewers to “confront their own prejudices and racialised thinking”, but the reality is that many will still take such portrayals at face value.Indeed, a sense of haughtiness from liberal audiences seems key to understanding why “ironic racism” has had the foothold it has in popular culture. In his 2006 piece The Heyday of Snobbery in The New York Times, columnist David Brooks writes of us entering “the era of mass condescension”, whereby “cultural entrepreneurs” have enabled us to “look down at our mental, social and spiritual inferiors”. His criticism of Sacha Baron Cohen’s 2006 comedy film Borat is particularly evergreen having described Baron Cohen’s franchise as often dependent on “an explosively funny rube-baiting session orchestrated by a hilarious bully”, 14 years later Baron Cohen still secures his cultural cachet through baiting and caricaturing what liberal, bourgeois audiences consider to be the unfashionable, stupid and obnoxious face of racism – all the while giving oxygen to abominable views.Last month, Baron Cohen “pranked” the far-right March for Our Rights 3 rally in Olympia, Washington, disguising himself as a country singer and encouraging the crowd to sing along enthusiastically to a bluegrass tune with obscene lyrics. These lyrics ranged from patent racism (“Obama, what we gonna do? Inject him with the Wuhan flu, “WHO, what we gonna do? Chop ’em up like the Saudis do”) to conspiracy theories about coronavirus being a “hoax” tied to 5G.As many have observed, the prank was a real-life pastiche of an outrageous segment from Baron Cohen’s own series Da Ali G Show, which, in 2004, featured the character Borat performing In My Country There is Problem, otherwise known as “Throw the Jew Down the Well”, with the stated aim being to expose the bigotry of the performers’ audience. As Baron Cohen is himself Jewish, one may be inclined to pardon this particular song as the self-parody minorities often make towards their own ethnic and cultural groups. However, this performance exists within the context of Borat being used in the presentation of Kazakhstan as exceptionally intolerant and “backwards”, and it is overwhelmingly this specific trope that the comedy is extracted from. His portrayal culminated in the government of Kazakhstan threatenening legal action against Baron Cohen after he hosted the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards in Lisbon in character.In 2020 – particularly considering the often obsequiously pious mode of liberal self-reflection and “anti-racism” in light of Black Lives Matter 2.0 – Baron Cohen’s stunts simply don’t land like they used to. It was foreseen: his unauthorised appearance as Ali G at the 2016 Oscars, apparently a physical commentary on the racial politics surrounding the awards show, which had reached a fever pitch with #OscarsSoWhite. As Emma Brockes commented, the trope is exhausted and simply serves to “gratify the comedian’s intellectual vanity” – although she observed that the stunt appeared to be better received in Britain than in the US. While 2016 seemed to be a turning point, criticisms of Ali G have been long-term and consistent, even if quietly marginalised in the 00s cultural renaissance of disparaging comedy. It is not true that everyone once found these performances funny, but they have simply now reached their expiration date. The black actor and comedian Curtis Walker described Ali G as “offensive” 20 years ago, saying that Baron Cohen is “dishing out all the cliches and stereotypical language. I find it quite degrading and sad that this is what catches people’s attention. I don’t like the concept of a white guy playing a black guy anyway, and when he is playing a stupid stereotype it is even worse.”Defenders of Ali G often falsely claim that the depiction does not amount to blackface because it does not feature the physical blackening of the skin. However, as Walker says, it is the embodiment of black stereotypes and the cliches of dress and language, from gangster chains to his misappropriation of Jamaican patois – “wagwaan” and “big up yaself” are regular catchphrases of the character.Although blackface has been a dominant, and for many inappropriate, talking point in recent months, there are many unresolved, and potentially more worrying, areas of racism that still exist on TV and in culture. Earlier this year, a new British sitcom, Kate \u0026amp Koji, debuted on ITV, which drew its comedic appeal from the interactions of a traditionalist white, working-class seaside cafe owner and an asylum-seeking doctor “from Africa” who speaks in a thick, non-specific accent. The sitcom has been previously described in the  as “a show so distasteful and dated that watching it is like looking into a time-capsule montage of Britain’s finest moments of racial prejudice”, while the Independent called it “agitprop”.Critical engagement with the racism underlying film and TV is a start, but scrutinising the liberal attitudes that allowed, and still allow, “ironic racism” to flourish is another challenge, as middle-class viewers continue to enjoy the entertainment created by a perceived distance between them and the “real racists”. But it is not the people they disparage who have presided over or are responsible for the entertainment that they are now having to publicly and embarrassingly backtrack on. As Nwonka says, the “racist character which exists outside of racism” is, at its heart, a flawed premise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d091f0342090b3c7d1f16aa147666f3d720aa8f5/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=96a26dc894d0b5f94fc3f2b3c0e8af50","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about going back to work","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have been shielding about their thoughts on returning to workFrom 1 August, those who have been shielding in England will be able to leave their homes to exercise, buy food and visit places of worship for the first time since March.They will also be able to return to work, rather than continue to work from home, as long as their place of employment is ‘Covid-secure’.If you have been shielding during the lockdown and are returning to work from August, we’d like to hear from you.How do you feel about retuning to your workplace after shielding for four months?

It is scheduled to open in December 2021.In addition, the government has already invested £93m in a state-of-the-art manufacturing innovation centre near Oxford which will have capacity to produce millions of doses of a vaccine each month.Construction has already begun in Oxfordshire on the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre, which is due to be completed in 2021.The two vaccine manufacturing sites will have the capacity to produce enough doses of a coronavirus vaccine for the entire UK population, when it becomes available, as well as vaccines which can treat other diseases.The Braintree site was built in 2017 as a fish vaccine manufacturing site, however Benchmark Holdings decided it no longer required the plant because of a change in strategy, meaning it has never been used.The company had wanted any purchaser to commit to retaining the 75 people already working at the site.Peter George, chair of Benchmark Holdings, was inspired to contact the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, after seeing him mention the vaccines taskforce during a daily coronavirus press briefing in late May.After obtaining Vallance’s email address, George said he received a response “within ten minutes”, putting him in touch with the government’s vaccines taskforce.George describes the sale of the site to the government as a “triple win”.He added that the firm sold its plant “at book value to the government, so we’re not making a profit, but the government is getting a good deal on equipment and facilities, and 80 people have got ongoing employment”.Both plants will not be open until 2021, and the government has previously invested £38m to establish a rapid deployment facility, which will open later this summer.Business secretary, Alok Sharma, said the government was taking all necessary steps to ensure it can provide enough doses for the public as soon as a successful Covid-19 vaccine becomes available.“This new Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult Manufacturing Innovation Centre, alongside crucial investment in skills, will support our efforts to rapidly produce millions of doses of a coronavirus vaccine while ensuring the UK can respond quickly to potential future pandemics,” Sharma said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66238cdc2db048e692d41aba800ce57251fcf332/0_131_4554_2732/master/4554.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1a8f6ef819e08a64d7484c1176c3dbc1","title":"is this the best of times the worst of times or both","story":"This week, the Upside finds that optimism will be better than pessimism at tackling global heating “Is this the best moment ever? Are we on the brink of extinction? Can both be true?”So begins Lily Cole in her forthcoming book Who Cares Wins, a very Upsidey piece of work which manages to champion not one “ism” but two. Cole’s central argument is that if we are going to confront the looming climate catastrophe, we will need not just a prodigious surge in environmentalism but a huge dose of optimism as well.The model, actress and activist articulates this well: optimism isn’t childish credulity or pretending things aren’t very serious. It isn’t the cynical tropes of the political classes eager to get voters to suspend their disbelief. Optimism, she says, is the belief that goodness can prevail, “that the long moral arc of the universe does bend towards justice”.Oh, and it’s much better than pessimism at actually getting things done.We felt Cole’s book was so perfectly attuned to the Upside that we optimistically invited her on to the Upside, live! to talk about hope, the environment, and all those inspiring agents of change out there. Membership Event: The Upside: In conversation with Lily Cole She agreed. The event takes place on Friday 31 July at 1pm BST. Tickets are inexpensive, easy to get and here, in that order. Book now, and let me know whether you think optimism is enough, and I’ll endeavour to put your point to Lily during the hour-long chat.In answer to Cole’s opening question – yes, of course both are true. It’s perfectly possible for two seemingly contradictory ideas to co-exist. Just look at this week’s Upside pieces:Get in touch with your favourite contradictory ideas that co-exist. We’ll publish some of the best in coming weeks. Next week: what you said about population.$1.15m. That’s how much Greta Thunberg won in the inaugural Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity. It’s also the amount she is giving away.That is more money than I can begin to imagine, but all the prize money will be donated, through my foundation, to different organisations and projects who are working to help people on the front line, affected by the climate crisis and ecological crisis.”In other environmental news, the likely range of global warming this century has narrowed to between 2.6C-3.9C. Apocalyptic predictions of warming of more than 5C now seem less likely.The Seattle Times has a series called Stepping Up, which focuses on moments of compassion and community.

It also described the initial policy of discharging the elderly from hospital into care settings without a Covid-19 test as a “terrible mistake”.Public Health England issues guidance stating that it was “very unlikely” care homes would become infected. The guidance was not withdrawn until 12 March.Despite a lack of official statistics about fatalities, care homes warn that they are at “breaking point” and MHA, the country’s biggest charitable provider, says it has suspected cases in more than half of its facilities.The Department of Health and Social are guidelines on discharging hospital patients into care homes states: “Negative tests are not required prior to transfersadmissions into the care home.”Testing is expanded into care homes but only for people with symptoms.Five of the largest care home providers say they have now recorded a total of at least 1,052 deathsCare home deaths are included alongside deaths in hospitals after a sharp rise of more than 4,300 deaths over a fortnight in England and Wales. Testing is extended to staff and residents without symptoms.Launch of a national delivery system for personal protective\u0026nbspequipment to care homes is hit by a delay of up to three weeksAcademics report that more than 22,000 care home residents in England and Wales may have died as a direct or indirect result of Covid-19 – more than double the number stated in official figures.An unpublished government study which used genome tracking to investigate outbreaks revealed that temporary care workers transmitted Covid-19 between care homes as cases surged. In evidence raising further questions about ministers’ claims to have “thrown a protective ring around care homes”, it emerged that agency workers – often employed on zero-hours contracts – unwittingly spread the infection as the pandemic grew, according to the study by Public Health England.A report by care homes bosses says that thousands of people lost their lives “prematurely” because care homes in England lacked the protective equipment and financial resources to cope with the coronavirus outbreak.Care leaders, unions and MPs round on prime minister Boris Johnson after he accuses care homes of failing to follow proper procedures amid the coronavirus crisis, saying the prime minister appeared to be shifting the blame for the high death toll.The British Medical Association (BMA) said the government’s testing and tracing capabilities at the start of the crisis fell “far short” of what was needed and left the infection to “spread unchecked”, while the Unite union doctors group said the government had been slow and had “squandered” weeks of valuable time.Their perspectives on the government’s management of the crisis are among the first submissions to an inquiry run by the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus, which has received 900 submissions from iniduals, charities and public bodies in two weeks.Public hearings will be held online every Wednesday with recommendations for the government due to be made by the end of summer, which MPs say is crucial in preparing officials for an expected second wave of the virus. Boris Johnson said this week he would look at the findings.The groups to have given evidence include the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons. The inquiry will hear from bereaved families on 5 August, and later from those with persistent and ongoing effects of Covid-19, and from health care staff with post-traumatic stress disorder. Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP and chair of the cross-party inquiry, said: “The purpose of this group is to save lives. We are not here for a blame game, that will be the purview of a proper inquiry, but my worry is that the government has made mistakes and is continuing to make mistakes and we need to find a way to pressure them into making changes.“We are going to have to rake over the coals on what decisions could, and should, have been taken, but we are going to come up with recommendations and say: these are the areas that need to be tackled now in case of a second wave.”The BMA said it was giving its evidence to help the government prepare for a second wave and to improve care, which it felt could be managed through learning and planning.However it was highly critical of the initial response, blaming the government for delays in reaching its 10,000 tests-a-day target. This level was achieved by the end of March.“The initial government response in relation to the availability of testing and tracing fell far short of what was needed, which resulted in the infection spreading unchecked, as government did not initially have the capacity to test more widely, and its 10,000 tests-a -ay target was delayed.“This situation continues, as ongoing delays to the NHS tracking app remain an area of serious concern, particularly as lockdown measures ease and we face the possibility of a second wave of the virus,” a BMA statement said.The submission from Age UK said there was “no doubt” that a lack of access to PPE and inadequate testing regimes “played a role in the rapid spread of cases”.It said discharging people into care homes without knowing if they had coronavirus was a “terrible mistake that was only rectified in mid-April”.“Furthermore, while care homes were quick to reduce the number of visitors, many have been forced to rely on agency staff to sustain safe staffing levels. This certainly hasn’t helped, and, in some cases, it may well have facilitated the transmission of the virus between care settings,” Age UK’s statement said.“The moral case, for government, on behalf of us all, to act to make good the deficits that have been laid bare, is even stronger than it was before.“Older people in receipt of care, in care homes especially, have been catastrophically let down and many have died before their time as a result. The fact that similar tragedies have unfolded in other countries too is no consolation and no excuse.”The Conservative MP and group vice-chair, Dan Poulter, said it was vital that lessons were learned before a difficult winter. Labour’s Clive Lewis, Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville-Roberts and the Scottish National party’s Philippa Whitford are also on the committee, along with the Green party life peer Jenny Jones.Other inquiries have taken place on specific elements of the coronavirus response since March. The House of Commons’ petitions committee launched its investigation into the government’s response to the coronavirus, which has so far reported back on its impact on parental leave and students. The health and social care committee also began an inquiry in March looking at the management of the coronavirus outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aec043b30de2e3da8ced13d1535e112032510e9/0_32_2484_1490/master/2484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e00ba2f1df6faf4b32695650214b3967","title":"coronavirus live news us cases top 4m as who chief chides pompeo for untrue claims","story":"Brazilian president seen with supporters Belgian rise in infections largely among young adults future Tokyo Olympics must be ‘simple and safe’Norway will re-impose a 10-day quarantine requirement for people arriving from Spain from Saturday after a surge in Covid-19 cases there, while it will ease restrictions on people coming from Sweden, the government said on Friday.Residents of the European Union, European Economic Area or Schengen countries with fewer than 20 confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the last two weeks are able to enter Norway without being required to go into self-quarantine.The latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) showed coronavirus infections in Spain had risen to 30.9 per 100,000 inhabitants.India has given regulatory approval for Cipla Ltd to sell the anti-viral drug favipiravir to treat Covid-19, the drugmaker said on Friday, as coronavirus infections in the world’s third worst-hit nation show no sign of abating.The drug controller general of India granted Cipla accelerated approval to make and sell favipiravir in an effort to meet the “urgent and unmet” need for coronavirus treatment options in the country, the company said. Indian drugmakers including Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd are racing to supply generic versions of favipiravir, originally developed by Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp as Avigan for treating influenza.India reported over 49,000 fresh cases of the novel coronavirus with 740 new deaths on Friday, marking the biggest daily surge in cases, as officials in some states complained of shortages of vital drugs for those hospitalized.Cipla said it would launch favipiravir as “Ciplenza” in the first week of August, priced at 68 Indian rupees (91 cents) per 200 mg tablet.Separately on Friday, much smaller Indian drugmaker Jenburkt Pharmaceuticals Ltd said it would launch its own version of favipiravir, priced at 39 rupees per tablet.Israeli police deployed water cannon and arrested 55 people overnight at a protest in Jerusalem against the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.A few thousand people had gathered in the city for what have become frequent rallies against Benjamin Netanyahu.The prime minister, facing an ongoing corruption trial that includes a serious charge of bribery, is fighting fresh public discontent after a recent surge in Covid infections.Demonstrators have rallied near Netanyahu’s official residence on Balfour Street in recent weeks.

Not at the sight of the falls – one of the most stunning natural wonders of the world – but rather at the prospect of US tour boats with blue-ponchoed Americans.“I see it many, many times a day. I look out the window, and there it is again,” said DiMaurizio, the vice-president and general manager of the main Canadian tour company, Hornblower Niagara Cruises.His company’s boats can carry up to 700 people, but Ontario’s strict social distancing rules have only permitted them to carry six passengers at a time.The stark difference reflect radically different approaches that Canada and the US have taken to tackling the coronavirus pandemic – and their dramatically contrasting outcomes.‘It’s like night and day’: Trudeau’s and Trump’s Covid-19 responses fuel wildly different outcomesRead moreThe US side of the falls lies within New York state, an area with a population of 19.5 million, and which has seen 414,000 Covid-19 cases and 32,000 deaths.On the Canadian side, Ontario – with a population of nearly 15 million – has seen 38,000 coronavirus cases and 2,755 deaths.You can read more on the stark Covid-19 ide between Canada and the US – including on travel bans and quarantine rules, as well as healthcare – from reporter Tracey Lindeman here:Russia plans to resume some international flights from 1 August, deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova said on Friday, but the list of destinations will initially be limited to Tanzania, Turkey and the United Kingdom.International flights were grounded on 30 March after the imposition of lockdown measures to curb the spread of Covid-19, which has infected more than 800,000 people in Russia.Golikova said the falling number of coronavirus infections had allowed Russia to resume flights from airports in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Rostov-on-Don.Flights will resume between London in the United Kingdom, Turkish cities Istanbul and Ankara and the island of Zanzibar in Tanzania from next Saturday. More holiday destinations in Turkey would be added from 10 August, Golikova added.Golikova said Russia would take care to ensure that the resumption in flights “does not lead to a new appearance of imported (coronavirus) cases on Russian territory”.Russia continues to report thousands of new coronaviurs infections daily. Its nationwide tally is 800,849, the fourth-highest in the world, with 13,046 deaths.Several dozen protesters in masks gathered in front of Japan’s National Stadium in Tokyo on Friday, the day the Olympic Games should have begun, to protest against holding them next year given the danger of Covid-19.The Games were postponed in March due to the coronavirus crisis and the government is determined that they go ahead next year, but opposition is growing in the country over doubts that a big sporting event can be held safely even next year.“I believe it’s a massive mistake,” said Kai Toyama, 44, an artist who travelled from the capital’s suburbs to attend the small rally. It was irresponsible for Japan to go ahead with the Olympics, he added.“I think more people should be vocal about the fact that we shouldn’t hold the Olympics during the coronavirus,” said Toyama, who wore a long black coat adorned with the Olympic symbol and the words “declaration of no Olympic Games”.A recent poll by Kyodo News found that fewer than a quarter of respondents were in favour of holding the Games as scheduled next year, a dramatic turnaround from the excitement during Tokyo’s successful campaign to host the Olympics back in 2013.Olympic organisers have said all possible efforts will be made to ensure the 11,000 athletes expected to take part will be able to travel safely to Tokyo and compete in world class surroundings.But experts have said this will be difficult without the development and global distribution of an effective vaccine for the coronavirus.The UK foreign office has updated the list of countries and territories exempt from advice against “all but essential” international travel.The further 19 countries and territories that have been added are: Laos, Cambodia, Fiji, Samoa, Sri Lanka, Cuba, Guadeloupe, St Barthelemy, St Martin, St Maarten, Aruba, New Caledonia, Curacao, Cook Islands, British Indian Ocean Territory, Falkland Islands, St Helena, Ascension Island and Tristan da Cuna.Second coronavirus test results on Bulgaria’s prime minister, Boyko Borissov, and the head of his political team, Denitsa Zheleva – who had initially tested positive for the virus – were negative, the government press office said on Friday.The two had been in the Bulgarian team that attended the European Union summit earlier this week, a spokeswoman said.Boris Johnson, the UK’s prime minister, has said people who are opposed to vaccinations are “nuts” as he promotes an expanded programme of flu jabs that ministers hope will ease pressure on the health system if there is a second wave of coronavirus this winter.Visiting a doctors’ surgery in London on Friday, the prime minister said to staff: “There’s all these anti-vaxxers now. They are nuts, they are nuts.”Johnson added that while he was worried about a second wave of Covid-19, he believed the UK would be through the crisis by mid-2021.“Whether it came from … a bat, a pangolin or however it emerged, it was a very, very nasty thing for the human race,” he said. “And I think by the middle of next year we will be well on the way past it.”You can read the full report from our political correspondent, Peter Walker, here: The European Union has proposed measures for companies to raise funds faster as they recover from the Covid-19 crisis, leaving Britain to decide whether to follow suit.The proposals, some temporary, would cut the cost of prospectuses for companies issuing more shares and help banks offload poorly performing loans more easily, to free up balance sheets and lend more.It follows a package of quick fixes for banks that was approved in June in record time. On Friday, Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU’s financial services chief, told reporters: We would be aiming that those changes would need to be adopted and starting to apply by the end of the year.”The banking package could generate billions of euros in additional lending, but commission officials say the amendments to securities rules were aimed more at cutting red tape by saving time and human resources that could now be devoted to dealing with the pandemic.Britain, Europe’s biggest financial centre, has already left the EU, but under transition arrangements will continue observing EU rules until the end of December. Direct access for its financial markets to the EU will depend on its rules being as robust as the EU’s.“We must see whether the UK is also applying these changes,” Dombrovskis said.Given the amendments simplify and ease access to finance, “I would imagine it would be a benefit for the UK economy,” he added. Otherwise, Britain would end up with stricter requirements than the EU. Some of the reforms now being eased had been pushed for by Britain when it was an EU member.Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borissov has gone into quarantine after the head of his political office tested positive for coronavirus late on Thursday, the government press office said in a statement.Borissov, 61, whose first test for coronavirus came out negative, will stay in self-isolation until the results of a second test taken early on Friday come out, a government spokeswoman said.Bulgaria has registered a spike in coronavirus infections in the past month. On Friday, the Balkan country had 268 new cases, bringing the total to 9,853 including 329 deaths. This is Amy Walker, taking over from my colleague Nazia Parveen. I’ll be guiding you through the key global coronavirus developments throughout the day. President Cyril Ramaphosa has shut public schools in South Africa for a month, and pledged to crack down on corruption in aid and procurement spending related to the Covid-19 outbreak in the country.The announcement came a day after researchers revealed that excess mortality data suggested that South Africa’s Covid outbreak had contributed to very substantially more deaths over a 10-week period from early May than official figures suggested , and among further steep increases in the number of confirmed cases in the country.There are now more than 400,000 cases of Covid-19 in South Africa with more than 6,000 deaths.“We have taken a deliberately cautious approach to keep schools closed during a period when the country is expected to experience its greatest increase in infections,” President Ramaphosa said during a TV address to the nation on Thursday evening. “This has also been the experience in a number of other countries where schools have opened and have also had to close.”Schools were shut during a strict lockdown imposed in March and April. Ramaphosa’s address received a mixed reception. Some critics claimed that government policy is overly influenced by the concerns of key constituencies of the ruling African National Congress party, including teachers’ unions. Others highlighted the failure to investigate and convict senior ANC officials and other iniduals linked to a series of corruption scandals.The president said that 36 cases of Covid-related graft were already at an advanced stage of investigation, and that substantial fines had been paid by companies for price fixing during the outbreak.France has reported a rise in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases after more than 1,000 new infections were recorded in 24 hours.Santé Publique said there had been an rise in Covid-19 cases among the over-75s and an increase in cases in care homes. The authorities say there has also been an increase in coronavirus cases among young adults.The increases were due to people dropping their guard and not systematically employing health safety measures including keeping a 1-metre distance, they said.“Santé Publique France and the Assurance-Maladie observe a slackening of the application of barrier gestures which results in an increase in the number of contacts at risk per patient with Covid-19, and less adherence to physical distancing in particular. During the summer and holidays, it may seem artificial to greet each other at a distance, talk from a distance, wash hands regularly and wear masks in enclosed spaces, but this inidual and collective effort is crucial to prevent the virus from encroaching on our freedom and the epidemic from rebounding,” read a statement.On Friday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, held a meeting of the country’s defence council at the Élysée to discuss the rise in cases and consider new measures including whether to tighten controls French borders with Belgium and Spain and possible quarantine measures for international passengers at airports.Hong Kong’s sudden spike in coronavirus cases may have stemmed from its willingness to let seafarers skip quarantine while changing ships in the city, a leading health expert said.After its previous success tackling the disease and ending local transmission, case numbers in the densely packed finance hub increased this month, sparking fears of a new outbreak spreading out of control.The city reported 123 new infections Friday, a new daily record, bringing the total tally to 2,372 with 16 deaths. Most of the new cases were locally transmitted.Some health experts have blamed an exemption from the usual 14-day quarantine which the government granted to “essential personnel” including cross-boundary truckers, aircrew and sea crew.But officials have said the arrangement was necessary, while insisting it was a “misunderstanding” that the new wave was attributable to the exemption.After analysing virus samples from recent confirmed cases, Gabriel Leung, dean of the University of Hong Kong’s medical school, said on Thursday the virus’ resurgence most likely stemmed from such imported cases.He said the wave was “probably because of the multiple imported (cases), it could be the crew members or sailors exempted from quarantine”.“When they entered Hong Kong, there were no immediate quarantine measures or testing arrangements. You could imagine, some of the crew members, the hotel they stay in maybe is downtown,” he said.The Afghan health ministry has urged people to stay indoors and avoid gatherings for the upcoming Eid celebrations as the number of confirmed coronavirus related deaths has reached 1,225. Ahmad Jawad Osmani, the country’s acting health minister told a press conference on Thursday that hospitals were filled with Covid-19 patients.Osmai said that Afghanistan is still in the midst of the outbreak. “We are in a better position to fight with coronavirus because the percentage of people infected in Afghanistan is dropping. The number of people visiting hospitals has also decreased, but that does not mean that we will not follow medical instructions,” he added.The health ministry in the country recorded 14 new deaths from Covid-19 on Friday. In its latest update, it said the number of people who tested positive for the virus had reached 35,988, an increase of 60 on the day before.Most new deaths were reported in Kabul. The capital is the country’s worst affected area with 489 deaths and around 15,000 confirmed cases. Another death was reported in Helmand province.The United States has allocated more than $36.7 million to help Afghanistan address the Covid-19 pandemic, and expedited $90 million through the World Bank to support Afghanistan’s national health and education sectors and local government needs, the US embassy in Kabul announced Thursday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312181.1595544455!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plan to fully reopen schools at the end of august to be unveiled","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar says it would reflect badly on Ireland were it to be the only country Europe where schools did not re-open in September following the coronavirus pandemic.

It is expected the plan will be brought to Cabinet for approval early next week and published afterwards.Mr Martin is understood to have emphasised to Ms Foley and other Ministers that reopening schools is the Government’s single biggest priority in the coming weeks.Privately, a number of political sources close to Mr Martin, and also those close to the other coalition parties, believe the political consequences for the Government will be ruinous if the schools fail to open for pupils five days a week.“Nothing is more important for the Government politically,” said one high-ranking source. “Nothing.”‘On track’Dr Ronan Glynn, the State’s acting chief medical officer, said on Thursday the schools were “absolutely on track” to reopen based on how the Covid-19 infection rate had stabilised.Detailed guidelines will be issued to schools next week with templates on safe classroom layouts and protocols for a Covid-19 outbreak.Large quantities of hand sanitiser and personal protective equipment are being contracted centrally and will be distributed to schools.Teachers’ unions have signalled they will support the reopening as long as it is safe and supports are in place.Kieran Christie of the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland said his members would abide by public health guidelines as long as there are “no attempts to cut corners”.Separately, the Government has privately warned of potential liabilities arising from legal actions taken against the State by Leaving Cert students due to the introduction of the new predicted grades model this year.The warning is contained in internal briefing notes released under Freedom of Information.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Ireland is set to retrofit 500,000 homes and install 400,000 heat pumps by 2030Gas could start to leak as oceans warm, a prospect researchers said was \u0026lsquoincredibly concerning\u0026rsquoCritics say plan lacks climate safeguards such as blanket exclusion of fossil fuels"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to start"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins  Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has won a surprisingly close leadership contest against Catherine Martin, seeing off the challenge of his deputy leader by a margin of less than 50 votes. Mr Ryan won 994 of the 1,940 total valid poll, or 51.2 per cent, and Ms Martin won 946, or 48.8 per cent. The narrow margin of victory took both candidates and their supporters by surprise and will pose questions about the durability of Mr Ryan’s leadership. It also reflects isions in the party.\u0026nbspHe said it was too early to say if he would continue as leader for the full five-year term. Ms Martin said it was likely she would contest for the position again. Split The result reflected the split that emerged in the party over entering government and Mr Ryan’s style of leadership. Party sources said Ms Martin received more votes from Northern members, most of whom did not vote in the poll on government. At a press conference, Mr Ryan addressed perceptions he was malleable to other party leaders by saying: “I can play hardball too.”He said the really close result “could have gone either way. I will reflect on that.” Ms Martin pledged to support Mr Ryan’s leadership, asking people to “stick to Eamon” as the leader and to “stick” to the party.

Photograph: CollinsWhat’s in the plan . . .For businessThe Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme is going to be replaced by an Employment Wage Support Scheme. Employers whose turnover has fallen 30 per cent will receive a flat-rate subsidy of up to €203 per week per employee. The scheme has also expanded, and now workers such as seasonal staff and new start up firms operating in affected areas will be included.The Government had previously announced a €250 million restart grant, this is being more than doubled to €550 million and the upper limit for payments is being increased to €25,000 payments will also be available to those who already received a cash injection, through a top up mechanism, and some businesses like B\u0026ampBs who had been ineligible will be included.The waiver of commercial rates will be extended to September, which will cost the government €60 million. €55 million is being made available for small and micro companies, including measures to reduce rates and grants equivalent to 0 per cent in some loan products. The Future Growth Loan Scheme is being expanded from €200 million to €500 million, with the support of the European Investment Bank, with businesses up to 499 employees eligible for longer-term loans at competitive rates. The Covid-19 Credit Guarantee scheme is being expanded to €2 billion, as announced earlier this month.There is a new apprenticeship incentivisation scheme which will provide a €2,000 payment to support employers to take on new apprenticeships in 2020.There will also be subsidies of €7,500 paid to employers under a JobsPlus scheme, paid over two years to hire someone under the age of 30 who is on the live register or the pandemic unemployment payment. Firms will also be allowed to delay payment of their PAYE and VAT debts in part or in full for a set period, with no interest or penalties. There are funding packages for the seed and venture capital scheme (€10 million), another €10 million for the IDA, and €5.5 million for an online retail scheme, while the online trading voucher scheme will be expanded to €20 million. A €20 million Brexit fund for SMEs exporting and importing with the UK has been approved. For people The Pandemic Unemployment Payment will be extended to the start of April, but gradually cut, and it will close to new entrants from September 17th, 2020. It will be cut in line with people’s previous incomes, and over time payments will be brought into line with existing social welfare levels.There will be tens of thousands of upskilling and training positions across a variety of schemes, including a retrofit skills training initiative which will link up with a wider retrofitting programme. Overall, the budget for investment in skills, training and education is €200 millionThe Back to Work and Back to Education Allowances will be extended to people on the PUP. There will be new services to assist jobseekers. Including through JobClubs, JobPath and Local Employment Services.The bike to work scheme is being extended, and will include a limit of €1,500 on “ebikes”. The government’s help-to-buy scheme is being enhanced with the maximum relief available now €30,000, an increase of €10,000. The Taoiseach said he hoped this would improve affordability, and did not believe it would push up prices. The interest rate on tax debt repayments is going to be reduced to three per cent to help those struggling with these payments.For infrastructure and environmental spending€500 million will be made available to for capital works, consisting of €75 million for primary and secondary schools, €113 million for “active travel, public transport and renewables of transport infrastructure, €40 million for investments in heritage, arts and Gaeltacht projects €20 million for courts, prison and Garda projects, and € 10 million for fisheries and farm renewable energies.€15 million will be made available for peatlands rehabilitation, €100 million for a national energy efficiency retrofit programme, and €60 million for returning vacant local authorities houses to use, and for investments in water infrastructure. There will be €10 millio for town and village renewal.Capital expenditure is being increased by €1 billion for next year, to €9.1 billion. For the economyAs flagged this morning, spending on non-alcoholic beverages, food or accommodation of up to € 625 will be rewarded with a tax credit of €125. The Taoiseach said the level of spending to begin the tax payback would be just €25, and it will be administered via an app.There will be €10 million provided in a restart fund for the tourism sector and a €10 million performance support scheme for the culture sector to assist in planning for events during Covid-19.One of the major unflagged points is a new scheme that will allow firms that were previously profitable carry back trading losses early, leading to an immediate refund of some or all of their corporation tax.A new income tax relief will also be introduced for the self-employed who were profitable in 2019 but are now facing Covid-related losses.There will be a six month reduction in the standard rate of VAT, from 23 per cent to 21 per cent, effective from the beginning of September, at a cost of €440 million. This is a major effort to stimulate spending, and one of the most significant parts of the package. There will be investments in Covid-specific life sciences products to the tune of €25 million, and €10 million is going to be made available through the first phase of a Green Enterprise fund."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312660.1595588965!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"retailers can decide themselves how to use vat reduction varadkar says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar has defended the choices made  to revive the economy compared to decisions in the North where VAT rates had been reduced to help the hospitality and tourism sector. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Retailers can decide for themselves how they use the VAT reduction announced in the July stimulus, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said.The Government announced on Thursday that there would be a six month fall in the higher VAT rate of 23 per cent to 21 per cent, beginning on September 1st and running until February at a cost of €440 million.It is the single biggest cash stimulus ever for the economy – with business group Ibec estimating that it represents about 10 per cent of domestic demand in the second half of the year – and follows the example of other countries, notably the UK.Speaking on Friday, Mr Varadkar said retailers will decide for themselves whether or not they are going to pass on the VAT cut to customers and reduce their prices by two per cent. “Some might, some might not. It is a decision for themselves depending on their circumstances,” he told RTÉ’s Today with Sarah McInerney’s show.“This is something that is being done to boost business, to boost employment, to encourage spending and you may have retailers who take the decision that the difference that two per cent would make could be the difference between them keeping on an employee or not.“From my point of view, if I was going into a clothes shop today to buy a T-shirt or a suit or shoes, rather than a two per cent reduction in the cost of that I would rather keep on the staff member.”Asked by Ms McInerney if there were mixed messages being put out by Government as she said Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe had said the VAT rate should be used to pass the reductions on to consumers, Mr Varadkar said there was no mixed message around the objective, which was to sustain employment. The retailer could make the decision, he said.Mr Varadkar defended the choices made in the Republic to revive the economy compared to decisions in Northern Ireland where VAT rates had been reduced to help the hospitality and tourism sector.“Of course they (the hospitality and tourism sector) would like to have it both ways, they would like to have the best from the North and the best from the Republic of Ireland. But that is not how the world works. We had to make a choice. And when I asked people in restaurants and hotels which one is more important to you, the wage subsidy scheme or the VAT reduction of a few percent, they all said the first one.”Mr Varadkar pointed out that the wage subsidy scheme will end in October in the North. “I think that is the wrong decision especially with Brexit coming,” he said.Government spending is now running some €16 billion ahead of what was expected before the pandemic hit, a situation officials conceded was not sustainable in the long term. Nonetheless, senior sources also said the October budget was likely to feature additional stimulus measures.Tax rebateA “staycation” tax voucher worth €125 to encourage off-season holidays in Ireland was also unveiled yesterday. Mr Varadkar defended this tax rebate element in the which he said is aimed at getting people to spend, “to liberate their savings” and get more people back to work. He said that there has been a “huge increase in the amount of money that people are saving at the moment” and rejected a suggestion by Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman Pearse Doherty that the rebate excludes one million people.“Anyone who pays income tax or USC can benefit from this, so if you spend any where between €25 and €625 on a weekend away or in a local restaurant or local hotel, using an app you can take a photograph of the receipt, send it on to the Revenue and you’ll get a tax rebate in the next tax year,” he told Sarah McInerney.“It is designed to get people to spend . . . It’s designed to get jobs back, that’s the whole point. Sometimes you get a voucher for €100 – you go to restaurant or shop maybe you spend €30 or €40 more, but when you get 20 per cent tax back, you might actually make a trip you wouldn’t have made before and that’s bringing many hundreds of euros into the economy. So it’s designed to liberate those savings.”Mr Varadkar said that administering a voucher was not straight forward. “We do know everyone who pays income tax and USC in the country, we’ve a number for them, we know where they live, we actually don’t have a list in Ireland of every man, woman and child and where they live.”When asked about the possibility of using Personal Public Service (PPS) numbers, the Tánaiste said “there are absolutely huge numbers of duplicate PPS numbers and there are PPS numbers of people who don’t live in the country any more. So we could end up sending vouchers to people who lived in Ireland for six months years ago”.“I think if you went for a voucher system you’d find yourself with something chaotic quite soon. Take for example the electoral register, everyone knows how inaccurate that is, and it doesn’t include children. So the Sinn Féin idea, like a lot of what they put forward hasn’t been properly thought through.”Mr Varadkar said that the scheme is targeted at people who have lost their job and that it wasn’t about “the person sitting in the restaurant, it’s about the person who used to work in the restaurant . . . so that more of those 300,000 people who are on the pandemic unemployment payment can get back to work. At its peak over 600,000 were on that payment, it’s down around 300,000 now, we think it will fall below 300,000 in the next couple of weeks, we’d like to get as many of those people back to their old jobs as possible.“I think hospitality businesses and restaurants will be clever about it - this is an agile and innovative industry and I think they’ll arrange packages around it.”Other measuresOther measures announced on Thursday include the pandemic unemployment payment being extended until next April, but the rates will be cut from September and it will also be closed to new applicants from then.The temporary wage subsidy scheme is also being extended to March next year, but will be recast as a new scheme from September, with officials said to be working on a new permanent scheme which would see State support for temporarily laid-off workers. The extension of the scheme to April will involve lower payment rates to employers, but newly hired staff including seasonal workers will qualify and the total cost will be €1.9 billion.The bike to work scheme is being extended, while there will be significant investment in cycling and walking facilities, €10 million for the arts and €10 million for tourism. A range of new training and employment grants are included for iniduals and businesses, as well as incentives to take on apprentices.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Vietnam is important destination in Asia for illegal wildlife products such as pangolin scalesBeijing condemns \u0026lsquooutrageous move that will sabotage US-China relations\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoWhen they come, they take over ... the outside world needs to know what is happening\u0026rsquoPM Jacinda Ardern was notified by opposition leader of immigration minister\u0026rsquos affairMany cities and states locking down again as new infection figures hit record highsChina warns it will deliver \u0026lsquoresolute response\u0026rsquo to any move by UK to sanction officialsDozens missing as overflowing Brahmaputra River damage crops and triggers mudslidesMore than 150 people have died or are missing in flooding and landslidesTwo other teenagers who ate meat from same infected animal being treated with antibioticsAlmost 4cm-long nematode roundworm is thought to have come from raw fishThousands displaced after heavy rains trigger flash floodingMove after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312544.1595571019!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus us cases pass 4m as australia s victoria state to send in army","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMilly Brown, assistant in nursing conducts a Covid-19 swab test as large crowds queue at a Bondi Beach drive-through testing clinic in Sydney, Australia on Wednesday. Photograph: Lisa MareeGetty  More than 15.4 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded worldwide with more than 632,00 deaths, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.The World Health Organisation (WHO) is seeing intense transmission of the coronavirus in relatively few countries, its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Thursday. “We continue to see intense transmission in a relatively small group of countries,” he told a virtual briefing in Geneva. “Two-thirds of all cases are from 10 countries. Almost half of all cases reported so far are from just three countries.”Mr Ghebreyesus said reported comments by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo questioning his independence were untrue and would not distract the organisation from its work in fighting the coronavirus. Mr Ghebreyesus has come under criticism, especially from US president Donald Trump and Pompeo, who have accused him of being pro-China.The following is a summary of the latest developments on the virus around the world:US health officials issued guidelines for reopening schools as districts across the country weigh whether to bring kids back amid the coronavirus pandemic, a move that follows calls by Mr Trump for classrooms to resume in-person instruction this fall. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) laid out an argument on Thursday for bringing students back to campuses, citing the developmental harm that could be caused to children from missed education. The CDC said in a statement titled The Importance of Reopening America’s Schools This Fall that while parents, teachers and school officials are concerned about the risk of transmitting the coronavirus in classrooms, the “best available evidence indicates if children become infected, they are far less likely to suffer severe symptoms.” The CDC also said death rates from the virus among children are much lower than among adults.AustraliaAustralia’s Victoria state will send in the army to question people who have tested positive for Covid-19 as it battles to control an outbreak that claimed a record number of lives on Friday. Australia’s second most populous state of Victoria said on Friday six people died from the coronavirus in the last 24 hours, the highest daily toll since the pandemic began. Three people in their 80s and three in their 90s died from the virus overnight, Premier Daniel Andrews told a media briefing in Melbourne. Victoria reported five deaths a day earlier. The state recorded 300 new infections compared with 403 cases a day earlier.AmericasBrazil reported 59,961 cases, its second highest on record, for a total of 2,287,475. The nation, with the worst outbreak after the US, recorded another 1,311 deaths for a total of 84,082. Last week the WHO said Brazil’s outbreak had hit a plateau, and on Monday the nation reported 20,257 cases and 632 deaths. Mexico’s cases rose by a daily record of 8,438, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Deaths climbed by 718, the data show, although Mexico’s government had yet to release its official daily figures. Despite the record rise in cases, health officials have maintained that the spread of the virus is slowing in much of the country. Yet Mexico overtook Italy last week to have the world’s fourth-most virus deaths. Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Thursday he had lost some relatives to the novel coronavirus.

New cases had slowed to a trickle in June, before a nationwide lockdown was lifted, but since then more than 280 clusters have been detected, with wealthy Catalonia the worst affected, leaving hotels largely empty and bars shutting down. Health ministry data showed 2,615 new cases across Spain on Thursday, compared with a daily average of just 132 in June. In Catalonia, nearly 8,000 cases were diagnosed in the last 14 days - almost half of the 16,410 detected throughout the country - despite guidelines for residents of regional capital Barcelona to stay at home.Africa and Middle EastUganda recorded its first death from the new coronavirus, making it one of the last nations in Africa to report a fatality since the pandemic reached it.The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in South Africa doubled over the past 17 days to surpass 400,000. More than 13,000 cases were reported for a second consecutive day on Thursday, bringing the cumulative total to 408,052 -- the world’s fifth-highest. The government has forecast that the country is expected to reach its peak-infection rate in the coming weeks.

Yemen, already suffering from a five-year war that has caused the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, has proved uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic, according to data published by the medical charity MedGlobal on Thursday. Yemen’s official total number of cases is 1,610, with 446 deaths, so the high number of healthcare worker casualties outlined by the report suggests the true caseload and mortality figure is far higher. For comparison, in badly hit Italy, where 245,0362 people have caught the virus, 35,073 people have died, including about 100 doctors. Yemen currently has a 27 per cent mortality rate from the disease - more than five times the global average. default In a country where half of all medical facilities are out of action, and aid funding shortfalls are exacerbating the existing malnutrition and cholera crises, the loss of just one medical professional has a devastating exponential effect.

Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Without urgent funds and a clear timeline for reopening, he said, theatre owners will be forced to put the buildings up for sale.Lord Lloyd-Webber owns six theatres including the London Palladium, and said his company will not “be able to survive in the current form beyond January and February next year” unless Covid restrictions are eased.He said: “There are major buyers circling around who are not British and would like to own West End theatres.So it might not just be Chinese phone networks the Government has to worry about.”On Thursday, Lord Lloyd-Webber staged a performance (pictured below) at the London Palladium before an audience of 640 people - 30 per cent of its usual capacity - in the first mass-attended live indoor theatre even since lockdown.The show featured Beverly Knight, the singer and actress, and was part of Lord Lloyd-Webber’s ongoing trials of Covid-compliant performances.He has spent more than £150,000 on measures at the Palladium including temperature checks at the main entrance, one-way signage and self-sanitising door handles.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"harry meghan sue photographers los angeles alleged pictures","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are suing paparazzi for invasion of privacy after drones were allegedly used to take pictures of their son Archie at the house where they are staying in Los Angeles.In a 10-page legal complaint filed in the Superior Court of the State of California the couple said they were victims of harassment that had crossed a red line for any parent.The court document said: This action arises out of the relentless and quite frankly shocking efforts of the tabloid media to profit from serial intrusions of the privacy of a 14-month-old child in his own home.And the desire and responsibility of any parent to do what is necessary to protect their children from this manufactured feeding frenzy.No paparazzi were named in the complaint with defendants listed as John Doe 1 - 100.The complaint said drones have been flown as little as 20ft above the house three times a day.Helicopters have flown over as early as 5.30am and as late as 7pm waking neighbours and their son day after day, it said.Some photographers had also cut holes in a mesh fence erected around the property, according to the complaint.The Sussexes said the issue came to a head when they discovered that a photograph of Archie, purportedly taken on a family outing in Malibu, was being offered for sale to media outlets.They said the photograph was actually taken while they were in the garden of the house they are staying in, which would be illegal, as well as disgusting and wrong.Archie has not been in public, much less in Malibu, since the family arrived here, the complaint said.According to the complaint the case was part of an effort by the couple to discover who had taken that photograph of their son.The couple said they had a right to be left alone in the privacy of their own home and would not allow the tabloids to break the law by taking such photographs.The Sussexes are being represented by lawyer Michael Kump, who has previously acted for Kim Kardashian West.In the complaint it was detailed how the couple had moved to North America part-time to escape the incessant UK tabloid fabrications and for the first six weeks lived unmolested in North Saanich, Canada before paparazzi descended.Afterwards, they moved to Los Angeles, residing in a safer gated community at the generosity of a friend, but were again subjected to the paparazzi\u0027s insatiable appetite for harassing and intruding.The complaint said the Sussexes seek no special treatment and simply want to continue the public impact work that is so important to them while having the private life to which any family or inidual has the right.It said: The plaintiffs have done everything in their power to stay out of the limelight, except in connection with their work, which they freely admit is newsworthy.But the photos at issue are not news. They are not in the public interest. They are harassment.In a statement Mr Kump said: Every inidual and family member in California is guaranteed by law the right to privacy in their home.No drones, helicopters or telephoto lenses can take away that right.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are filing this lawsuit to protect their young son\u0027s right to privacy in their home without intrusion by photographers, and to uncover and stop those who seek to profit from these illegal actions.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz english town now has highest coronavirus","story":"Following the week that the Queen\u0027s granddaughter, Princess Beatrice, secretly tied the knot, it\u0027s time test your knowledge on the last seven days of current affairs. It\u0027s been a promising week in Britain\u0027s search for a coronavirus vaccine, but which British university is leading the way with the success of recent human trials? In the world of sport, Dom Sibley reached his second test century, but how long did it take him to register his 100 runs against the West Indies? If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters closely you will have come across all of the answers to this week\u0027s quiz.

Back in March, a studio making the decision to cancel its biggest film’s theatrical release due to a global pandemic was unprecedented and a huge surprise.In four months, these delays have distressingly become the norm.With cinemas across the world either closed or open with health and safety restrictions because of Covid-19, distributors are having to rethink film release strategies in a big way. While some – namely Paramount – decided to immediately delay key 2020 releases by an entire year, others were more hopeful that they would be able to release one of the first new films after cinemas reopened.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt hasn’t exactly panned out this way. Disney’s live-action remake of Mulan and new Christopher Nolan film Tenet, for example, twice had their release dates shifted by a matter of weeks. It has now been announced that each film has been removed from release schedules indefinitely.Other high-profile films that had their release dates shifted from the summer to the winter have now been pushed back to next summer meaning that, in some cases, audiences will have to wait more than a year to see them.Charlize Theron – one of Hollywood’s most astonishing action starsWhy is therapy on TV so far-fetched?One Direction songs, ranked worst to bestIt’s quite hard to keep up with every delay, so we have compiled a comprehensive list of all the films with their original release dates, and – where it has been announced – when you can now expect to see them in cinemas.NB: This list does not include the films that will be released on VOD or streaming services.No Time to DieThe Woman in the WindowFast and Furious 9In the HeightsMinions: The Rise of GruBill and Ted Face the MusicLast Night in SohoThe Many Saints of NewarkSpiral: From the Book of SawRaya and the Last DragonShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten RingsNo Time to Die\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspFast and Furious\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Garmin facilitates that with tools that allow them to be automatically pushed – so long as the online service that syncs new activities is working.That service has been offline for more than a day, leading the number of exercises uploaded to fall.Strava\u0027s status page collates the number of activities that are being uploaded over time, and shows a drop that begins early on 23 July, when the problems began.The company\u0027s graphs do not show the absolute number of uploads, but it is clear that the number of activites going up on the site has roughly halved as a result of the Garmin problems.The number of uploads coming through the Garmin Connect platform has dropped off entirely, as would be expected. The data appears to confirm that the company is being hit by a total outage, and that nobody is able to get through to Garmin\u0027s servers.Strangely, the daily graph shows a brief increase in the number of uploads overnight UK time. It is not clear whether that is an indication that Garmin\u0027s Connect service briefly came back online, or is just a quirk of the graph.Garmin is yet to comment on the nature of the outage, or when the platform may be back online.We are currently experiencing an outage that affects Garmin Connect, and as a result, the Garmin Connect website and mobile app are down at this time, it wrote in an update on its Twitter accounts.This outage also affects our call centres, and we are currently unable to receive any calls, emails or online chats.

The pop star collaborated with a number of her “musical heroes” for the record, including her frequent songwriting partner and co-producer Jack Antonoff, plus The National’s Aaron Dessner, and Bon Iver. Upon the album’s release, Swift shared a prologue of sorts explaining her thoughts and feelings surrounding the album. The prologue will also feature in packaging for CD and vinyl versions of Folklore.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRead the prologue in full below:“It started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity.Alanis Morissette’s Such Pretty Forks in the Road is a career bestTaylor Swift fans think Karlie Kloss dropped a Folklore Easter Egg “Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of “let’s run away” and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate.“Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I’ve never met, people I’ve known, or those I wish I hadn’t. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn’t his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out.“A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and fiction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone’s secrets written in the sky for all to behold.“In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I’ve told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve.“Now it’s up to you to pass them down.”Swift’s album has received critical claim in early reviews. The Independent gave it four stars and called it a “near-perfect album”, praising Swift’s songwriting as “exquisite, piano-based poetry”.Read the full review here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Textile, clothing and shoe stores showed the sharpest decline in total sales, at negative 34.9 per cent.“The retail sector bounced back as the reopening of shops released pent-up demand for some retailers,” Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics.UK economy has recovered around half of its coronavirus hitHow did the Chinese economy bounce back from the coronavirus crisis?China leads coronavirus recovery as economy returns to growthIt’s time to put the most persistent lie about Trump’s economy to bedCan we trust the predictions for Britain’s economy?“But the recovery is being felt unevenly across the sector, with clothing retailers remaining under significant pressure.“Some consumers searching to break the monotony of being at home headed for the high street, but numbers remained considerably lower than pre-Covid levels,” he added.Online retailers have fared better than high street shops during lockdown, with online sales continuing to go “from strength to strength”, said the ONS. Although the proportion of online spending dropped to 31.8 per cent in June compared to a record 33.3 per cent reported in May, it remains a “considerable increase” from the 20 per cent reported in February.Household goods stores were the only store type to see an increase in sales since the start of the pandemic, reported ONS, with online sales increasing by 103.2 per cent. Household goods stores also saw the smallest decline in store sales compare to other types of non-food stores.“We see increased sales in electrical household appliances and hardware stores, with feedback from retailers suffusing that people focused on home improvements during lockdown, which helped boost their sales,” said the ONS report.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Mr Erdogan was among those attending the high-profile Friday prayer service. The head of Turkey\u0027s religious affairs ministry, Ali Erbas, took the pulpit to deliver a sermon. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat could be more crestfallen than a mosque, the minarets of which are silent, the garden of which is deserted, the dome of which is mute, and the garden of which is lonely? he said. Due to the hostility to Islam that rises each passing day, there are mosques in various parts of the world today that are attacked, closed by force, and even bombed and destroyed, he said. Hundreds of millions of Muslims are facing oppression...We as believers who regard the meaning of Hagia Sophia as a lofty cause and sacred entrustment need to work to ensure that compassion, tolerance, peace, tranquility, and benevolence prevail all around the world.Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia had been officially a museum until two weeks ago, when Mr Erdogan redesignated it a Muslim house of worship following a court decision. The move was controversial, potentially damaging an institution that was seen as an symbol of interfaith harmony between Muslims and Christians and a nod to the secular legacy of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey. But the move proved popular among supporters of Mr Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party as well as strident Turkish nationalists. Hundreds of pious Turks could be seen rushing towards the Hagia Sophia to take part in Friday’s ceremony, some chanting “God is great.”The enduring fight for the Hagia SophiaIstanbul’s iconic Hagia Sophia to be turned back into mosqueThe debate over the future of Hagia Sophia explains modern TurkeyErdogan recites Islamic prayer at Hagia Sophia triggering outcry Turkish media reported thousands of worshippers arriving from around the country to witness the prayers, with officials beseeching potential visitors to stay away from the area to avoid overcrowding around the leafy square and ancient quarters near the Hagia Sophia amid the coronavirus pandemic. Turkey continues to report hundreds of new infections daily, adding to a total caseload approaching a quarter of a million. The Hagia Sophia, considered among the most cherished masterpieces of Byzantine era architecture, was converted into a mosque following the 16th century Ottoman conquest of the city that was then Constantinople. Its status as a museum has long irked pious Turks alienated by the country’s 20th Century secularist governments.  “Today is the day when this imposition and this pressure has ended,” pro-government columnist Ibrahim Karagu wrote in the daily newspaper Yeni Safak. “The victory is ours and we are a nation which is used to having victories. The parenthesis of the last century when we were doomed with defeats is closed.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, of the Republican People’s Party (CHP), said that he was not invited. Kemal Kılıçdaroglu, chairman of the CHP, rejected an invitation to attend the ceremony.Turkish officials have said the Hagia Sophia, a major tourism draw, would continue to be open to visitors of all faiths, and that entrance fees would be lifted. For prayer services, Turkish religious authorities have covered up Christian religious icons showing human imagery considered idolatrous in the Sunni sect of Islam. There are, however, plans to allow them to be visible except for during five daily prayer times. Turquoise prayer rugs have also been installed as part of an ongoing renovation.  Some historical preservationists have expressed concern. “It appears that the authorities have chosen to install a (presumably retractable) curtain mechanism to conceal the mosaics of Virgin and Child on the apse, and the Archangel Gabriel,” wrote Washington-based Turkey scholar Tugba Tanyeri-Erdemir, voicing concern about the mere two-week period used to prepare the building for prayers.“The choice of materials for the curtain is crucial. Is the fabric concealing Hagia Sophia\u0027s mosaics fire retardant? Is it evaluated for pest control and dust accumulation?” she wrote on Twitter. “When we are dealing with ancient buildings we need to carefully assess all risk factors.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Vladimir Putin has awarded the rank of major general to Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov – a man who has been linked to the killing, torture and disappearance of hundreds.   Mr Kadyrov, who published the new honour on his social media pages on Thursday, said the Russian president had called him personally to read out the executive order.“It is a high distinction that I value highly,” he wrote. “I’m the president’s loyal solider, and ready to carry out any order on any continent he wishes.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe move comes less than three days after the US State Department announced the blacklisting the controversial strongman and his family. On Monday, secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the sanctions were the result of “numerous gross violations of human rights dating back more than a decade”.Thursday’s development appeared to be a direct response to the US snub, and was trailed two days ago when foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova first responded to the US move. “It will be difficult to respond reciprocally, but we will think up something,” she said.  Mr Kadyrov’s own response fell much in line with his brand. In a message on Telegram – his Instagram, and Facebook accounts have been suspended – he posted a picture of himself brandishing two guns. “Pompeo, we accept the fight!” the caption read. “What comes next will be more interesting.” Since assuming power from his assassinated father in 2004, the tiger-loving strongman has ruled Chechnya as a personal fiefdom. He enjoys autonomy unrivalled among any other regional leader – the result of a grand security bargain to keep order following two bloody wars with Moscow. Chechen leader denies gay massacre saying ‘such people do not exist’The strongman has used the deal to deliver personal riches and a regime of terror, with critics frequently disappearing in mysterious circumstances. Mr Kadyrov is understood to have supported several waves of repressions of LGBT+ people beginning in 2017. At least three men have died, with dozens missing, and hundreds more reporting torture. Russian authorities have refused to investigate the evidence, or open a criminal case. Igor Kochetkov, whose Russian LGBT Network led the frontline emergency effort to evacuate at-risk citizens, said the honour underlined the Kremlin’s attitude to human rights abuse. “The authorities are showing they don’t want to investigate Kadyrov’s crimes,” Mr Kochetkov told The Independent. “The award of military titles and honours tells him everything he needs to know.”  No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Health officials have strongly urged the public not to buy up surgical masks, which are vital for frontline health workers to protect themselves while treating patients.Instead, Brits have been advised to try making their own at home version.Homemade masks wont offer the same protection as medical-grade masks, but experts say they still work to some level.One of the simplest ways to make one at home is to use paper you already have at home - just take two layers of kitchen roll and one tissue cut in half.You then cover each end with masking tape, punch two holes in and thread elastic or a hair tie through to fit around your ears.If you want to stfen it so that it is more secure you can add some wire into the ends before taping them up.Another method involves using a T-shirt without the need for any sewing or stitching.A YouTube tutorial by Runa Ray explains that for the t-shirt method, you need to cut out a in by in rectangle from the material.Then fold it in half and measure in on either side before making an equal number of cuts along the edges with scissors.Then turn the fabric inside out and knot each of the tails, but leave the four outer edges.Cut two more strips of material and tie them to the ends - these are the straps that will go around your ears.Some people have also used a vacuum cleaner bag to create a face mask, which is a bit more complicated - and only worksyou have a spare, clean bag to hand.The Government has also released \" href\"https:www.gov.uk government publications how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"instructions on how to make a face mask from a T-shirt.You dont have to make your own homemade face mask to keep yourself safe. A face covering can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.It should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. Before putting your face mask on, wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and repeat after taking it off. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose. Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched.You should wash a face covering regularly - it can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent.The Government says that face coverings should not be used by children under the age of three or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly.For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.Children should also only wear a face mask under the supervision of an adult.People with disabilites, breathing dficulties and children are exempt from wearing face masks in stores and on public transport. These people have been asked to download an exemption card from the TfL website so that they can show staff when asked about wearing a face covering.Experts are still pretty ided on their effectiveness outside of a medical setting.Wearing a mask can act as a physical barrier to prevent infecting othersyou are sick by blocking the droplets that come out when you cough or sneeze.The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies that is advising the government said the evidence that masks slow the spread is marginal but positive.But some experts argue that people can accidentally infect themselves when taking a mask off or they can lead to complacency with other measures such as hand-washing.As soon as you touch the mask having put it on it becomes redundant, some say.New evidence from Hong Kong about face masks has been shared confidentially with the World Health Organisation.The data hasnt been made public yet but it reportedly suggests that the protective gear was effective in slowing the spread in Asian countries.Professor Susan Michie, of University College London, said there is not good evidence to suggest wearing masks will cut transmissions.She said: They do not protect against the virus getting into the eyes - only close fitting goggles do this.People may not fit the masks properly or take them on and off. Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, reviewed  studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use.Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly — which is not something the general public has been trained in.She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.Face masks were made mandatory for people to wear on public transport from June  and people will be forced to wear masks in shops from July .On July , Matt Hancock confirmed that from July  it would be mandatory for people in England to wear face masks in shops.Anyone spotted flouting the new rules could be hit with a £ fine. Shopkeepers have been asked to implement the new rules in their stores.Passengers on public transport have already been told to wear masks when travelling, with commuters refused travelthey arent wearing oneTransport Secretary Grant Shapps has urged people to only wear face coverings - such as a scarf, piece of cloth or mask - and not surgical masks which should be reserved for health staff.Commuters should expect to see signs at stations and transport hubs outlining the new rules.Speaking on May , the UK Governments chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said wearing face masks had a marginal but positive impact on the spread of infection.Where masks may have a role is where distancing isnt possible, where there might be undue crowding, he added.But Sir Patrick says wearing a mask should not replace social distancing and hand washing - which are both vital.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Shocking new statistics show people with epilepsy are the worst affected disability group in education and employment - more than those with severe disfigurements and heart problems. Figures from the Office for National Statisticsshow that Brits are more likely to have a degree than to have no qualications at all – but those with epilepsy are the least likely to have a degree and the most likely to have no qualications out of all disability types.But although more than half of Brits with the condition dont have seizures , over a quarter have no qualications and the majority remain unemployed. Louise Cousins, a spokesperson for Epilepsy Action, says children with epilepsy are likely to miss a lot of time in the classroom because of seizures, recovery time, and medical appointments. It’s shocking that so many people with epilepsy struggle to gain qualications, she tells Sun Online. Sadly, though, it is not surprising. Our current education system does not meet the needs of many children with epilepsy. This has a knock-on impact on their lives and future prospects.Seizures and anti-epileptic drugs can make kids extremely tired and create problems with concentration and memory – though these dficulties often go unrecognised and unsupported in school.Hannah, now , from Swansea, said at school she was made to feel lazy, stupid, and clumsy because of her epilepsy. She believes the low qualication rate for people with the condition is due to the students lack of confidence. Hannah experienced her first seizure when she was just six years old.What I remember most about school is being told off because I couldn’t remember what we were doing in a particular subject after a bad night of seizures, Hannah says. Your memory just doesnt stick.You lose confidence. You want to do well but then you get knocked down.Hannah skipped classes as she felt unsupported.I learnt how to play truant, she says. Especially when I got older.Hannah left school with no qualications at the age of , claiming her GCSEs had been an absolute failure.Hannah now stresses how important it is that children with epilepsy get the support they need in school. When you’re that young and not getting the support, it affects friendships and what the teachers might think of you, she says. Ana Patterson, , from Twickenham, thinks that the low qualication rate among people with epilepsy could be because kids with epilepsy in school can feel like an outsider.Ana was diagnosed at -years-old with photosensitive epilepsy and experiences tonic-clonic seizures – the typical movie kind of seizure where you go unconscious and start shaking, she says. I dont think staff or teachers really know how to deal with epilepsy. I dont blame them too much because epilepsy is a disorder that is so dferent in each inidual so I think some of that problem comes from the lack of communication between the hospital and school.But I often felt like a liability and that people werent always sure what to do.Ana says her school were often too quick to call the ambulance when they didnt need to as in her case of epilepsy, an ambulance only needs to be calledthe seizure lasts for five minutes or longer or she hurts herself.I felt aseveryone was tiptoeing around me, and this lack of understanding made me feel like an outsider, Ana says.I think we need to recognise epilepsy in education and schools as these children need to grow up and feel accepted.They need to feel like there are people looking out for them but that they can be just as normal as the next people, their classmate, who is neurotypical and fine.But the education system is not the only area where people with epilepsy face particular challenges.The same disparities are sadly mirrored in the workplace where  per cent of working age adults in the UK with epilepsy are out of work – compared to the national unemployment figure of  per cent.Philip Lee, chief executive at Epilepsy Action, says that epilepsy is still a stigmatised condition in the workplace.These figures are very worrying, yet they only skim the surface, he adds.From the initial application and job interview process to the day-to-day experience of working, many people with epilepsy encounter clear barriers and discrimination. Hannah re-sat her GCSEs in her twenties and went on to study for a degree in volcanology with the Open University.But she remains out of work and still feels discriminated against because of her condition.I feel like Im on the scrapheap, she said. Even though I know I can contribute to this society.As soon as I say that I have epilepsy, which is reasonably controlled because I have a VNS implant , employers will just say, Oh, well thank you but we’re not interested, and that’s it. Its a neurological condition where sudden bursts of electrical activity in the brain cause symptoms including seizures, unusual behaviour, and sometimes loss of awareness. Epilepsy can sometimes run in families or begin after head injuries, but its precise causes arent always clear.Medication can be taken to manage seizures, but its often a lelong condition. Most children with epilepsy can go to mainstream schools, take part in sports, and get a job when theyre older. But certain activities like swimming, driving or certain jobs may be more dangerous for people with epilepsy.Or they will say, Yes we can try you for three months, and then after three months they will come up with an excuse and say, Oh actually, we’re closing down or, We don’t need you anymore.Two weeks later you will see the same job you’ve just been doing for the last three months advertised again. You just lose hope in the end.Sophie Wild, who is currently studying politics and human rights at Leeds Beckett University, always felt supported in education.Yet the -year-old, from Lancashire, has already felt discrimination in the workplace due to her condition.Sophie worked in a chain fashion shop part-time while studying, but ran into problems when she changed stores.My new manager gave me loads of grief about my absences from when I was at the other store and he said that I was going to get investigated for having too many absences, Sophie says. One time I rang in sick and he was on the phone to me for  minutes giving me grief about my absences from when I didn’t even work there and from when I was in hospital and had a two-week sick note. He just wasn’t listening to me and I was trying to explain to him that I have days where I can’t get out of bed and he was just being really dismissive of it.I was upset, I was crying on the phone and he was still going on at me so I just thought I’d rather quit my job than make myself ill.Sophie said that because epilepsy is an invisible disability, she doesnt feel that she faces day-to-day discrimination.But she admits she feels nervous telling people she has the condition, particularly employers.I think it makes people nervous –I tell someone they’re always really shocked.I feel likeI applied for a job and they knew that I have epilepsy they might not want the burden of someone having a seizure in the workplace or being off. I feel like it makes people scared.Schools are required by law to make reasonable adjustments to help children with epilepsy.These could include allowing extra time, repeating things already taught, regularly checking that pupils have understood lessons, and allowing extra time in exams.With the right support from medical professionals and school, children with epilepsy can flourish in education and reach their full potential, a spokesperson from Epilepsy Action told Sun Online.Under the Equality Act, people with epilepsy are legally protected from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society.Lee calls on employers to take simple steps to help support people with epilepsy.Increased knowledge and a change in attitudes are the only ways we can start to close this inequality gap. Employers should encourage transparency from the outset and make it their business to learn more about epilepsy. It’s only then that they can improve workplace culture and create a level, more inclusive, playing field to help people with epilepsy pursue the career they want.”A government spokesperson said: The safety, wellbeing and outcomes of children with complex needs - including those with epilepsy - is a priority for this Government. Schools must follow our statutory advice on supporting pupils with medical conditions so that they have full access to education, and can enjoy the same opportunities at school as any other child.Throughout the pandemic we have supported families of children with SEND, kept schools open for children with education, health and care plans where appropriate, and signposted to high quality online learning resources.We now spend a record £billion a year to support people with disabilities and later this year well launch a national strategy to set out how we can better support them to have equal access to all spheres of le.Epilepsy support and resources can be found at epilepsy.org.ukOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Quick-witted, smart, self-deprecating, incredibly likeable and a bit odd-looking. A man who gives hope to fans, both through his career and marriage to Abbey Clancy.Then a double calamity struck. Euro  was cancelled and instead of ­canning the project the BBC pressed on with SOS, shackling it with a hostage-to-fortune title and all sorts of baggage and “other stuff” the show could have done ­without as well.Aside from a garden centre set and enormous table, around which Churchill could’ve signed the Yalta agreement, the baggage came in human form: Crouchy’s former team-mates, The Horne Section studio band, a guest comedian and, of course, Maya, who provided my series highlight when she got dangerously side-tracked by the host’s leisure and tourism qualication.“I don’t want to sound silly or anything,” said Maya, carefully setting her own trap, “But what is a GVNQ ”“It’s a GNVQ.” Obviously.As awkwardly as hosts and guests have all gelled, though, the thing that’s really torpedoed this show has been the other stuff. Those outside broadcasts and studio features that were meant to fill the ­football gap, but didn’t.Two regulars were a chino-clad irritant called Fast Dad, who competed against the host to win football memorabilia for a viewer and “Peter’s Extreme Retirement”, which included all the ideas Alan ­Partridge would’ve thought a bit naff, like water-skiing with Joe Cole.The game not even Crouchy’s GNVQ could help him understand, though, was a VAR-related pun called Very Accurate Rhythm.On Saturday it involved Mo Gilligan playing keepie-uppie to The Horne ­Section’s version of Hit Me Baby One More Time. In previous weeks, however, it was Tinie Tempah and Katherine Ryan having a go at swingball and Jimmy Carr playing Mel C at table tennis.There’s a scoreboard as well, yet no sense of what the hell’s going on here, other than the fact that not a single ­person at the BBC knows how to produce light entertainment.If they did, one of them would have given Peter Crouch the two words of prime-time advice he desperately needed to hear. Don’t. Swear.They didn’t, though. Crouchy and his mates swore like he was presenting a late-night E show and so ended up with an E-sized audience of about one ­million. That’s the reason you never see masters of the light entertainment art, Ant  Dec, dropping the F-bomb.In its youth-driven madness, the BBC might think this is a good thing but it alienates the people who actually pay their wages and has direct consequences for Crouch who, before this started, I thought, could have become a ­Saturday night staple. Now  Mystery guest round on A Question Of Sport, tops. That’s how he’s been coping without the football, Maya.And ex-Celtic manager John Barnes enlivening ITV’s Stephen Lawrence: Has Britain Changed  debate by telling the audience it needed to “elevate people like me and people like Barack Obama”, asthe former US President had ever worked with anyone of the magnitude of Jackie McNamara and Regi Blinker.You’re far too modest, John.Celebrity Snoop Dogs, Kevin McCloud: “It’s the much-loved Martine McCutcheon.” The One Show, Amol Rajan: “Today’s first guest is a man of many talents, Nick Knowles.”Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer, Maya Jama to the host: “God loves a trier.”Loves  He’s sent down a plague of locusts for less than SOS.ANYONE who watched last night’s episode of the landmark BBC series Once Upon A Time In Iraq is unlikely to forget it in a hurry.The story of the  invasion is grimly familiar, but what sets this show apart are the testimonies from its eyewitnesses.None of them wastes words. All of them are mesmerising.Two, though, still managed to stand out from the others.The first was a darkly funny Iraqi called Waleed Nesy who, before he became a journalist’s translator, was pro-war and fronted Baghdad’s only state-approved heavy metal band which, I’m desperately hoping, were called Black Sabba’ath.The other was ferociously bright US army officer Lieutenant-Colonel Nate Sassaman, “a charismatic leader of men” who was hoping to bring peace, democracy and lots of other empty promises to the country until he entered his first local medical centre and: “I’m telling you, the woman running it  She was as hard as a woodpecker’s lips.”Both were damaged by the catastrophe that unfolded and, in the case of Sassaman, helped cause, but they somehow retained their humanity, honesty and sense of humour, which made their testimony all the more astonishing.Like all great war documentaries, Once Upon A Time In Iraq was also prepared to let silence tell the story when the brutality or stupidity became too overwhelming.They made an exception for Waleed, though, when, six weeks into the invasion, President George W Bush boldly declared: “Mission accomplished.”“Mission accomplished  Oh yeah  . . . SERIOUSLY ”Three more episodes will tell you very graphically how well that worked out and they’re as good as anything you’ve watched all year.INCIDENTALLY, I’m grateful to This Morning hosts Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes for revealing blind Celebrity MasterChef contestant Amar Lat measured liquids with “talking jugs”.Which, by a million-to-one coincidence, was also ITV’s original working title for Loose Women.My Strange Addiction: “Eating mattresses can lead to liver damage, intestinal blockage and even death.”But on the plus side, it won’t leave you bed-ridden.Emile Heskey: “When your back’s against the wall, it’s easy to lie down.”Jeff Stelling: “This game will be over when the referee blows the final whistle.”And Chris Kamara: “Three points is another point on the board.”BY the way,you haven’t ever seen Chernobyl, one of the greatest TV dramas ever made, Friday, pm, Sky Atlantic, is your chance.No further excuses will be accepted.WITH no little air of self-congratulation, last week, Celebrity MasterChef welcomed its first ever blind contestant, “travel presenter” Amar Lat, who arrived with a helper and his own super power.“I’ve started to hear the food talking to me,” he explained. “It’s almost like it’s communicating to me and it’s saying . . .”“Don’t worry, Amar. The BBC won’t chuck you out first. It’d look bad.”As good fortune would have it, he didn’t need to worry too much as it was the worst line-up of the series and included Gethin Jones, playing to the camera, rapper Lady Leshurr, whose speciality seemed to be “in-flight meals” and Alan Partridge star Felicity “Lynn Benfield” Montagu, who served up a salad for the guest judges that looked like a Haitian voodoo rattle.The real fall guy, though, appeared to be Jeff Brazier who, at the first challenge, was tugging away at a string of garlic for a good ten seconds before he twigged. “Ah. It’s a decoration. It’s made of polystyrene.”Those people who cry at absolutely everything, of course, were quick to let everyone  know Amar’s eventual progression to the semi-final made them “cry”.I thought the highlight of the week, however, came at the end of the pair’s dessert challenge when the judges’ comments led Amar to ask: “Are you two fat ” and Gregg Wallace replied: “Are you familiar with Jean-Claude Van Damme ”“Yes.”Then get someone to talk you through his voiceover on Minions: The Rise Of Gru.The resemblance is uncanny.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We knew it cracked down on all domestic opposition. We knew of the way in which they were undercutting the economies of the West.But not until the spread of the Wuhan virus did so many people come to realise how untrustworthy the Chinese leadership is.Now, every day brings more bad news about China. It isn’t because China is doing any-thing new. It is because China has caught the world’s attention.Not in a good way.Just consider the events of recent days.The Chinese government’s mistreatment of its Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang has been known about for years.The Muslim minority group, who regard themselves as closer to Central Asian countries — their language is related to Turkish — have long been in the government’s sights.Armed guardsFor years the Chinese Communist Party has had Xinjiang under its version of special measures.Claiming the one-time independent state, which borders eight countries, constitutes a special security risk, the communists have had the people there under mass surveillance.Even before the recent mass imprisonment, they have had them subjected to forced labour.In recent years they have subjected the entire population to compulsory birth control to try to reduce the size of the population.But for years the world’s attention was not focused on this.We all had troubles of our own to look to.So the Chinese authorities got away with putting perhaps as many as one million Uighur people in what are basically concentration camps — places where these people are meant to be “re-educated” and otherwise “corrected”.Now, drone footage has surfaced which shows shackled, blindfolded prisoners in the province being marched on to trains by rows of armed guards.The scenes are awful.As our Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, rightly said at the weekend, they are “reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time”.He is right.Yet when the Chinese Ambassador to our country was asked about this at the weekend, he pretended to have no idea what the footage was.He even tried to ert attention by asking his inter- viewer whether he had ever himself been to the charming province in question.But we are not as easily distracted by China as we used to be. Every day brings fresh causes.First, we had China’s appalling behaviour in Hong Kong, breaking its agreements with the UK and cracking down on the local population.Then last week came our Government’s decision to remove Chinese firm Huawei from any involvement in Britain’s G network.Huawei is basically a Chinese government agency and it would have been a serious security breach to allow it to control all our internet communications. Or to develop a back door for looking into them.Then a number of senior Conservatives warned that social media app TikTok is “as much of a threat” to Britain as Huawei.That may sound funny to parents whose children are addicted to it.For most of us, the app is just a source of amusement or bemusement.Depending on your age.But whatever your reaction to it, a growing number of people believe Chinese tech-nologies like TikTok are not safe. Because TikTok’s parent company is ByteDance, a Chinese firm founded in .Of course, the company claims to be independent, as all such firms do, but in China major firms are not independent as they are in Britain or other free societies.Critics insist TikTok could easily be used by hostile forces to harvest information from, and otherwise target, all those who use it.Of course, all of this has brought a degree of sabre-rattling from Beijing.China’s leaders have got used to telling everyone  what to do.As they spread their financial wings in recent decades, countries like ours were very keen to enjoy the benefits.Universities in the UK repeatedly took money from China. Money with strings attached.But money that some of our greedier universities thought was free. Only later learning otherwise.Naturally, the turnaround of recent months has been badly received in Beijing.Its ambassadors and state media have spent recent days pretending it is Britain that is the untrustworthy partner.They are wrong.We are not inconsistent or unfair. We are simply a country that has begun to wake up to a threat.Like the rest of the world. And not a moment too soon.Jaguar Land Rover builds cars for them under a joint venture with Chery Automobile. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has , employees in China across several manufacturing sites, as well as an innovation centre and a ­campus.So as tensions ramp up after the decision to remove Huawei from the UK’s G network, Britain should remember it, too, has aces to play. Most notably tech and skills.To learn about these is why so many Chinese students come to our universities. It is the same reason why state-owned China General Nuclear Power is a one-third partner in the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.It will have a front-row seat to the latest tech as China prepares to build around  reactors of its own.Saying no to Chinese firms is not to be taken lightly.There are around , Chinese companies that do business in the UK.

Weve already managed to secure  million doses of future supply of the Oxford vaccine.My best estimates are thatthis continues to run with the success that we have had so far, it would not be unreasonable to think that we will be getting some doses of that vaccine this side of Christmas. The UK has also signed deals for options on two other vaccines. When you get to the point where youve got a vaccine concept thats reasonable, then the success rate is typically about ten per cent. And what that tells you is that, to be sure that youre going to get a vaccine, you need multiple shots on goal. You’ve got to back more than one horse, and the UK Government is doing that. We are expecting to host five or six big vaccine trials in the UK in the autumn and yesterday we launched a website to allow the public to register their interest to take part in the trial. We are hoping to have , people per trial, so up to , participants. We’re not looking just for -year-olds, but people from a range of backgrounds and comorbidities. Im a glass half full man. Im cautiously optimistic that by late spring next year there will be several vaccines that will have made it. My confidence is increasing week by week with the news that comes through.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He seems fine.” Seriously Let’s hope this was just an attempt at media distraction and that, behind the scenes, he and other influential friends are telling Kanye the truth he so badly needs to hear — that he needs serious, prolonged treatment for his mental health, and fast.And , like so many famous people, he’s surrounded by “yes men” who put profits before their clients’ health, then they too need to support his we and family in their bid to get him treatment.It won’t save his presidential chances, but it might just save his le.JOHNNY Depp reportedly referred to Magic Mike star Channing Tatum as “potato-head”.A hot potato though, right SHOW me the boy of seven and I’ll show you the man.Fellow pupils who attended the private Durham School with Dominic Cummings describe him as isive, argumentative and “contemptuous” of his peers, with a look on his face that suggested: “I know better, I’m tolerating you.”A description that will no doubt sound familiar to the entire Cabinet.

And so, consequently, we have gravitated towards the nostalgic food brands that remind us of that time.Though it has to be said that The Bloke’s Heinz Mushroom And Bacon Toast Topper he purchased back in  is a step too far and remains untouched.He was stopped by Border Force teams.Either that or, just like the rest of us, he hired it for an hour and, a few minutes in, drted aimlessly after becoming paralysed with boredom.ONLINE dating frauds have soared by  per cent as con artists exploit loneliness in lockdown then ask to borrow money.The most vulnerable targets were women aged  to .With this in mind, here is my cut-out-and-keep guide to hopefully minimise the chances of this happening to you. If he tells you he’s a spy then he almost certainly isn’t.If he says he’s an airline pilot, only believe it when you see him sitting in a cockpit in full unorm.If he claims all his money is “stuck in Panama”, he’s penniless and after your cash.And finally,he goes incommunicado for several days and claims his phone broke, he’s probably been away with his we and four kids.You have been warned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As long as they are working from home, they are contributing to this country’s problems in three separate ways. The first, and in some ways the most obvious, is that the services they provide are not as good as they should be. I remember fondly that when I was Immigration minister ten years ago, the Passport Service, which in its time had been a national disgrace, won awards for being a model public service.It was quick, flexible and customer friendly.All that has been thrown away under lockdown.There are no appointments in person any more, and I have seen reports that some passports are taking  days to be issued. More than a million passports have expired since March, soyou want to venture abroad next month you may have to be very lucky.If travelling is dficult, driving is not much easier.Anyonewho needs to renew a driving licence is stuck in a long and growing queue.At the other end of the age range, taking your driving test means waiting weeks or months. None of this is good enough in a country aching to get back to normal.The second reason why civil servants should be back at their desks as long as it is safe is that they are often the economic heartbeat of parts of our big cities.Whitehall in London is the most obvious example, but in other cities the public sector is also hugely important for economic activity.Shops, pubs and sandwich bars are open again buttheir customers are miles away they may as well shut their doors once more.As the unlocking has progressed, every MP has been lobbied hard by the sectors who have felt left behind.Gradually the second wave businesses — the nail bars and gyms — are getting their way. But so many of them rely on their location to succeed, and that location works because there are people whose offices are nearby.Empty offices are a death knell for nearby businesses. Footfall is key.The third reason is the most subtle, but perhaps the most important. It is that Government offices need to set an example to the rest of the country.If a private sector employee is wondering whether toto the office, and a neighbour who works for the Government is cheerfully planning to work from home indefinitely, the obvious question arises: “Why should I start commuting again ”Partly for reasons of safety and partly for reasons of convenience, many people have found working from home suits them.This is especially true over the summer, whenyou have a garden it is better to be there two minutes after you stop work than in a sweaty train.What this has come to mean, though, is second-class public services and the throttling of business.It is time for the civil service to set an example.It has had months to make its offices safe, and we have seen the ingenuity of pubs, restaurants and bars in doing the same in much less time, and sometimes with a clientele that will be much less disciplined.So safe offices should now be filling up again, with workers ending those backlogs and restoring the vitality to our cities.Above all they should be sending the signal that Britain can take big steps back towards normal le.A day in the office will mean our streets and shops come back to le.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than , babies are thought to lack legal status because parents couldn’t register their births. And hotly anticipated family holidays have had to be cancelled because of worries over passport delays.Yesterday, Boris Johnson and his cabinet met in person for the first time in months to set an example that it’s safe to go back to work. But civil servants are still nowhere to be seen.They need to get all hands back on deck and be thankful that, unlike countless others, they still have jobs to go back to.PUBS and restaurants might be open again, but their problems are far from over.As head of the National Time Out campaign Jonathan Downey explains, hundreds of small businesses are closing their doors for the last time just as punters cautiously start to .Why  Because despite being forbidden from making money during lockdown, publicans and bar owners are now expected to cough up their rental payments — ­in full — to their landlords.We know there’s no quick fix. And Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already been incredibly generous to the hospitality industry.But pub, restaurant and cafe owners are the beating heart of this country.They provide work for thousands and keep millions more cheerful.If they put their heads together, surely banks, landlords and the Government can find a way to give these powerhouse employers a break while they get back on their feet.A DAMNING report makes it crystal clear that Russia is a real, hostile and active threat to Britain and its interests.The long-awaited document stretches to -odd pages, but the bottom line is this: The UK underestimated the threat from the Kremlin, and is still playing catch-up.From now on, our Government must be twice as vigilant in defending Brits from both shameless cyber attacks and insidious influence campaigns.A rogue state which murders Brits on British soil has no place in this country.NEWS that eight in ten of us plan to holiday in the UK this year is music to our ears.It looks likely the estimated £billion boost for the economy will be injected straight into rural areas and coastal towns — the places that need it most.Fingers crossed the lovely weather holds!GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You must vote Leave in that referendum.”I said to him: “Excuse me, sorry for asking, but are you a Russian ”He looked aghast and said: “Nyet! Why would you think that ”And I said: “Because you speak funny, you have borscht on your tie and you’re glowing, in a radioactive manner, slightly.”He went off around the pub saying the same thing to everyone . Later, I saw him with a bottle of vodka in one hand doing that dance where you crouch down and kick your legs out and shout “ha!” every so often. I wandered up. “Are you SURE you’re not a Russian ”There’s vodka dribbling down his chin and he smells of piroshki dumplings and isotopes. “Nyet! I am Englyishman. My name is Jyohn Smeeth.Definitely not Russian, definitely not KGB, my frent.”“Oh, OK,” I said, “No worries, good night.”“Dosvedanya, toich,” he replied.OK, that didn’t quite happen. But the remainers have got it into their heads that something like it did. We all voted Leave because the Russians interfered in our referendum. Meddled with our democratic process. Which is why we should stop leaving and have another vote.The allegation is that the Russkies tried to persuade us to vote leave by spreading  news around.What  news was that  That the European Union is an authoritarian bureaucracy run by pygmies from Luxembourg  That the EU wanted ever-closer political control over our country That we spent enormous sums of money keeping gibbering oafs like Jean Claude Juncker in office, while subsidising the useless states of Europe I don’t knowspecial agents Ivan and Dmitri were putting that stuff around, but I was well aware of the fact long beforethey were.Is there anything anyone can point to which suggests that the Russkies had an effect  There’s an allegation that they tried to ensure that the Scots voted for independence from the UK. And we should all vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the  election. Not hugely successful meddling operations, then, were they The thing about the alleged Brexit meddling is that it plays into the same narrative the remainers have been peddling for four years. We were all thick, us leavers. We voted Leave because we were DUPED. First by Boris and Nigel Farage. And now by the devilish Russians. Too dense to understand we were being conned, we voted Leave.Looking at the EU today, I’ve never been happier that we voted to get the hell out, incidentally.I have no doubt the Russians meddle in our affairs. I very much hope our own cyber spies are doing the same thing to them. I know the CIA is up to all sorts of tricks.Russia is not a very pleasant country right now and we should complain when it crosses the line — which it does, every month or so. But the idea that it had a decisive effect in our Brexit referendum is an insult to all those of us who thought long and hard and then voted Leave.The remainers can’t get over that we did so. They cannot bear to be defied. Tough. It wasn’t the Russians wot won it. It was us, the ordinary people of this fine country.And we’re still very glad we did.COVID has been good for some people. A lot of better- off people have been able to save loads of money, for example. And they don’t come much better off than the boss of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.Jeff has seen his income rise by a very agreeable £billion. That’s kind of enough money to buy France. So how about this, Jeffrey How about you get your company to pay the right amount of income tax in countries where you make so much money, such as the UK Last year Amazon did £billion worth of business in the UK – and paid £million in tax. That’s a tax rate, then, of two per cent.Not right, is it GOB on a very strange stick Janet Street Porter has been screeching about men. Again.She was having a go at Prince Andrew. Well, fair enough. The bloke is neither use nor ornament. And may soon be up to his neck in legal problems.I agree with the first part of what the toothy old harridan had to say. “Prince Andrew has no skills, no mates and no redeeming features.”Yup, largely agree, pet. But then she went on: “And so many modern middle-agedblokes are like that. That’s why women have drinks parties with their mates on Zoom, binge watch Netflix . . . and only laugh when they’re talking to gay men or their girlfriends.”She ended up by saying that men were becoming “redundant”.Can you imagine the outrageI had a go at a spectacularly useless woman – Janet Street Porter, for example.And then said most women were like her and that women in general are becoming redundant Ooh, there’d be howls of outrage.A LECTURER who said Jewish people had high intelligence has been sacked.Stephen Lamonby also said that Germans were good at engineering. For this – expelled. No job any more.Here’s the thing. Jewish people make up . per cent of the world’s population. And  per cent of Nobel Prize winners, like Bob Dylan, pictured.Countless studies have been done which show that Ashkenazi Jews have what one researcher, called, “the primo gene”. A high intellect. And Germans – well, they have been good at engineering, haven’t they Engineering Daily ranked countries in order of their prow-ess in the field. Germany came top. The magazine said: “Germany has long stood the test of time to emerge as a champion in the engineering field, reputed for its technical universities, internships and perhaps a culture and an economy that rewards engineering skills with both prestige and career growth.”Telling the truth, then, can now cost you your job. This moronic terror of the truth now infests most of our institutions. It has to stop.DAVID and Mary Sheldon took their newborn baby boy to the register office.And then got very upset. The registrar complained about their choice of name for the kid. Said it might cause him problems getting a job, later on.The Sheldons were very angry, but eventually got their way. The name they chose for their son  Lucer. Yep, that’s right, the Prince of Darkness. The parents said Lucer meant “bringer of light”.And while technically they might be right, it also means “that nasty, scaly, red b who lives in Hell”.A spokesman for Satan said yesterday: “I’m delighted by the Sheldons’ choice of name for their child. Lucer is a much maligned and misunderstood entity.“We will keep a close eye on the little mite and ensure that one day he rules the world, ha ha ha ha ha . . . ”I WAS sitting in a restaurant up here on Teesside. First meal out since lockdown. Large bloke comes in wearing a face mask. Uses the hand sanitiser by the door.Sits down, very carefully keeping his distance from everyone . He orders a double chicken parmo.For those of you not from Teesside, here’s what a parmo, pictured, is. A breast of chicken hammered flat. Then coated in bread- crumbs and deep fried. Then smothered in creamy bechamel sauce. And then with loads of Red Leicester on top of that.You eat it with chips and it’s , calories. He ordered a DOUBLE.You could almost hear his heart saying to him: “Look mate. Speaking on behalf of all of your bodily organs. We’d much rather you got Covid than ate that.“I think we can cope with Covid. But that thing is going to finish you off.”SPAIN has seen a big rise in Covid cases. Yup, amigo, it’s the dreaded “second spike” we’ve all been worried about.But people from the UK can still travel to Spain unhindered. And Spaniards can travel here without restriction.The Government says it will look at inidual countries and,need be, take them off the “air-bridge” list. Here’s my suggestion, Boris. Do it NOW.Quarantine for everyone arriving from Spain. Don’t make the same mistake you made in March. Back then there were NO restrictions on people from Covid hotspots – .million people arrived here up until lockdown.And that’s why we have one of the worst virus death rates in the world. Be quicker off the mark, Boris. Keep us safe.THE BBC will not rest until all the statues of Winston Churchill are torn down and his memory besmirched.Earlier this week the corporation broadcast a semi-literate tirade of abuse about Churchill’s “racism” and supposed brutality towards Indians.It was by a woman called Yogita Limaye.

But the pandemic worsened and HMS Bubble restrictions were imposed.They have enjoyed being side by side again and exercised together with only a handful of staff disturbing their peace.But the Queen has continued to work and received her red boxes containing official documents from the Government.And royal sources have described how her spirits were buoyed by last week’s wedding of her granddaughter Beatrice, , and property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, , which was the kind of close-knit affair the monarch has always enjoyed.  It was the first time she had seen members of her family since March. Now aides are hastily trying to arrange more family reunions when the Duke and the Queen extend their time together for their annual summer stay at Balmoral in Scotland next month.With Harry and Meghan in LA and Andrew facing questions over Epstein, sources revealed the Queen has also taken great pride in William and Kate spearheading the fam- ily’s res- ponse to the Covid crisis.The “Iron Duke” — who spent four nights in hospital over Christmas as a precautionary measure for what Palace officials called a “pre-existing condition” — is delighted to be leading from the front.Invigorated by isolation, he looked back to his best in photos at Beatrice and Edo’s surprise wedding at All Saints Chapel in Windsor Great Park.Then he briefly stepped out of retirement on Wednesday to hand over his role as Commander-in-Chief of The Rles regiment to the Duchess of Cornwall.And he surprised everyone by walking down four steps and making a wisecrack to LCpl Colin Streetin.He asked the soldierhe was keeping fit and they both had a chuckle when bugler Colin replied: “Are you trying to say I am fat ” It is the sort of cheeky humour that Philip has become associated with during his many decades of public service.The duke was a dashing naval captain when he met the young Princess Elizabeth before the Second World War.They traded letters during the conflict and smitten Philip kept a photo of the future Queen.Philip and Elizabeth married in November  at Westminster Abbey. The duke gave up his Navy career when Elizabeth was crowned in .At her coronation, he pledged to “become your liege man of le and limb”. But he reportedly struggled to play second fiddle and was accused of affairs during their fledgling marriage, which have never been proven.A storyline In TV drama The Crown, featuring Philip having a fling with a Russian ballet dancer, was dismissed as fiction.At the couple’s th wedding anniversary in , the Queen said: “He has, quite simply, been my strength and my stay all these years.”After the duke retired three years ago, having clocked up , solo engagements since , the Queen spent weekdays at Buckingham Palace with a heavy workload before spending weekends on her own at Windsor Castle.Insiders say the duke was happy reading, painting and staying active and regularly spoke with the Queen on the telephone. Dickie Arbiter, former Buckingham Palace spokesman, said: “They get on very well. He has been at Sandringham becausehe stays in London and Windsor there is not a lot for him to do.”But after their Balmoral break they will have spent seven months by each other’s side — and aides are now working to keep them together.Traditionally at their Scottish home the Queen and Prince Philip have been hands-on and famously in charge of a family barbecue.The couple also welcome friends and family to the estate, although this year meetings will take place outdoors.They will travel together with a new HMS Bubble of up to  loyal staff.And no doubt the Queen and Prince Philip will be looking forward to spending as much time together as they can.Her Majesty and Prince Philip looked delighted and relaxed when photographed a socially-distanced gap from Beatrice and Edo last Friday.Their surprise wedding was only the second occasion the Queen had mixed with people outside her HMS Bubble.It signalled a carefully arranged end to her four-month-long isolation at Windsor Castle.The intimate and private ceremony had between  and  guests, allowing the Queen to see her family for the first time since March.Without the pomp and fanfare of previous royal weddings, which had taken months and years to arrange, there was very little stress involved.Instead, the Queen and duke, aided by staff, made themselves look immaculate and were chauffeur-driven the three miles to All Saints Chapel.Spending only  minutes at the Covid-secure ceremony meant they had enough time to see their granddaughter marry and greet sorely-missed family, including scandal-hit Prince Andrew.Beatrice and Edo also cheered the Queen by picking a date and chapel where she could attend before heading off to Balmoral next month.If the wedding had been much later then preparations for the August trip to the Scottish Highlands would be in full swing.And it meant she could still be back at Windsor Castle in time to hand a knighthood to Captain Tom Moore.Aides believe it was an easing back into engagements and social le for the Queen and duke.Plans are now under way to attempt more family reunions at Balmoral.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also warned that prices could go uppromotions were curbed.He added: These promotions, help make food cheaper that’s an imp thing at the moment. The government’s figures show that the average family will spend £ more on their shoppingthere are no promotional discounts. Is that something we really want to do at the moment when people are so hard pressed John OConnell, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, added: Hard-pressed hungry shoppers don’t need Boris piling on the pounds to their weekly food bill. Ministers are telling taxpayers to eat out to help out the economy, but also want to abolish the kind of price promotions which keep costs down and make everyday food affordable for millions. If it wants people to be out shopping, providing for their families and keeping the economy afloat, the government needs to stop this silly supermarket snobbery. Boris is said to have been persuaded by medical and nutritional advisers that tackling obesity is  per cent diet and  per cent exercise.  The radical plans contrast with the PM’s previous opposition to nanny state interventions but in May he said he had undergone a “damascene conversion” following his own brush with death after catching coronavirus, which disproportionately affects overweight men.He said he the coronavirus pandemic had convinced him that urgent action was needed to tackle Britain’s obesity crisis.But The Sun revealed last week that he had drawn a red line at fresh sugar taxes as he does not want to people to feel “bullied” into eating healthier.Instead he and Health Secretary Matt Hancock hope a ban on online adverts and pre-pm TV ads will change people’s shopping and eating habits. Sources said the obesity strategy will be about “helping people make better choices”.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I remember him often saying f****** ugly c***, you fat whore... but god I f****** love you - and things like this.She said her sisters relationship with the actor was tumultuous from the start and noticed signs of physical abuse - including cuts and bruises on Heard early on.Whitney claimed she tried to intervene and told Heard to leave Depp but felt sick when she discovered the had got engaged in September .She said: I told her it was a bad idea, begged her not to go through with it and said that she should end it because it wasnt going to get better.I asked her, why are you putting up with this  and told her that him putting a ring on her finger was not going to stop him hitting her.Whitney claimed she confronted Depp about allegedly hitting Heard for the first time in  - asking why did you f**king have to hit her She added: Sometimes he would flat out deny it or downplay it by saying No, I just pushed her, I didnt hit her.Other times, he would acknowledge that he had hit her but would try to justy it, by claiming she hit him first or she called me a p***y and would say, sis, I just lost control.Whitney lived two doors down from Depp and Amber on the top floor of the plush Eastern Columbia Building in Downtown Los Angeles.But she was booted out of the rent-free apartment after she claimed she was wrongly accused of selling photos of her sister and Depps wedding.When she ed to Heards home in December  after time apart, she claimed she saw blonde hair and blood stuck to a splinter on the bed frame.She added: I remember imagining what kind of force it would take to do that because it was such a heavy and solid frame.Whitney also claimed Depp would get upset about outfits Heard wanted to wear to glitzy events and was incredibly jealous and possessive and threatened by her former partners and co-stars.She told the court about one fight in  when her and Heard left Depp in Brazil so she could do a screen test for Aquaman.Whitney said: I remember his assistant, Nathan Holmes, and I joking about the fact we hoped she didnt get the role because Johnny would go crazy when he saw a picture of Jason Momoa, her co-star.She also told the court Depp was fond of a trick she taught him using a tampon applicator to snort cocaine.The sister also claimed Depp almost pushed her down the stairs as he punched the actress multiple times in a rage at his LA home in .Whitney said: I remember being worried that I was near the edge of the top of the stairs. When he got to the top of the stairs, he was pulling me backwards so he could get to Amber. I remember being scared because I was worried that I would fall backwards and fall down the stairs.Johnny reached out to shove me out of the way to lunge at Amber – reaching out to try hit Amber – and instead struck me, hitting me in the arm. Amber suddenly lurched forward and hit him and said, don’t hit my sister. I didn’t see exactly how Amber hit him but it didn’t seem especially hard it was just enough for him to lose momentum.She was just trying to protect me and I think it probably stopped me from being pushed down the stairs. There was a struggle with me stuck in the middle of it, and he really went for Amber. Somehow I was pushed out of the way so I wasn’t between them, but I was standing right there next to them when Johnny grabbed her by the hair with one hand and I saw him punch her really hard in the head with his other hand multiple times.Heard sensationally claimed in court this week Depp shoved ex-girlfriend Kate Moss down the stairs and feared the actor would do the same to her sister.She then admitted to the High Court she punched Depp during the very violent row on the stairs of their home.Depp is suing The Sun for referring to him as a we-beater in a  article.

One in eight oppose the idea of them being compulsory inside. The public will have to wear face coverings from Friday in all shops and supermarkets in England. Ministers announced that the rules also apply to post offices, banks, railway stations and airports. But other venues such as restaurants and pubs will be exempt as long as it is not for takeaways. Hairdressers, dentists, cinemas and the vets are among the other places where the regulations will not apply. The OnePoll study of , people for the Daily Mirror has found that roughly two-thirds support the new laws – while just one in seven is against. While most people think wearing face coverings in shops should be mandatory, one in four says it should be voluntary. The new law is prompting a change in people’s behaviour with half saying they will now wear a face mask in shops when they would previously not have done so. Over a third say they would have worn a mask when shopping anyway, while one in  say they would stop shopping to avoid wearing one. And a rebellious one in  claim they will try to shop without one.

Face coverings are mandatory by law from today in Englandaposs shops, supermarkets, takeaways, transport hubs, post offices, banks and indoor shopping centres, to slow the spread of coronavirus. But people with conditions like breathing dficulties, anxiety disorders or autism are exempt - as are children under . Care minister Helen Whately said: We don’t want to see members of the public accosted for not wearing a face mask. You can download the template for the exemption card or get a PDF to show on your phone here.  The main template says I am exempt from wearing a face covering and can be worn by disabled people as a badge or shown on their phone. Another template is designed to help lip-readers, who are allowed to ask people to remove their face covering under the law. It says: Please remove your face covering so I can understand you better.The government exemption card comes after charities already produced unofficial ones to help disabled people show why they were not covering their nose and mouth. The government had faced criticism for failing to produce an official card. James OaposRourke, , from Chingford, whose brother Tony, , has severe learning disability, said the cards were great but said yesterday there was no official version. He warned his brother would be subjected to abuse and prejudice, adding: For those who cannot or will not because of their disability, then weaposre just painting a big target on them. James Taylor of disability charity Scope added yesterday: In recent weeks, we’ve heard from disabled people who’ve been challenged over not wearing a face covering while using public transport, causing much distress and anxiety.“The government must make it really clear to everyone that disabled people who cannot safely wear face coverings are exempt. “Disabled people and their needs have been routinely forgotten throughout this crisis. If disabled people’s needs are ignored, society risks turning the clock back on equality.” Richard Kramer, Chief Executive of disability charity Sense said today: We are hearing lots of reports of disabled people being challenged for not covering up. These experiences cause distress and anxiety, and lead many disabled people to feel they have to stay at home, where they become isolated. We welcome the introduction of ‘exemption cards’, but this must be aligned with a messaging campaign from the Government.Despite the exemption card, the government has emphasised it is not compulsory - and exempt people donapost need one to avoid a £ fine. Ms Whately told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: We’re not expecting people to carry proof that they are exempt. We’re expecting people to be reasonable about this.  The governmentaposs website adds: Some people may feel more comfortable showing something that says they do not have to wear a face covering. This could be in the form of an exemption card, badge or even a home-made sign. This is a personal choice, and is not necessary in law. Anyone with a justiable reason not to wear a mask due to health or disability is allowed not to wear one under the new law.  But the wide range of exemptions has also led to warnings the law will be impossible to enforce against people who do actually break the law. Police can fine lawbreakers £ or use reasonable force to remove them from shops. But the College of Policing has said officers should only be required as a last resort.

But Baroness Doreen Lawrence – who became a Labour Peer in  – announces she is leaving the foundation she set up in his memory to focus on creating a national Stephen Lawrence Day. Here, she outlines plans to make April  a global event through her new Stephen Lawrence Day Foundation. She also talks about Black Lives Matter and the disproportionate number of Covid- deaths among black, Asian and other ethnic minorities. Stephen, , was murdered in a racist attack in Eltham, South-East London, on April  .  The Stephen Lawrence Trust was my le. Every day for years, I was in my little office trying to turn Stephen’s legacy into opportunities and chances for other disadvantaged young people. We supported young people in architecture who wouldn’t have stood a chance and we opened our doors to creative and professional people who needed somewhere to learn their craft and get ahead. But then two important things happened. The first was entering the House of Lords, which was something I had never thought of. But the welcome I got from the peers was amazing. I realised my fight for justice was generating such levels of respect, his name was just getting bigger. It was not only being taught in schools nationwide but also being actively celebrated in the heart of Parliament, by senior people who genuinely cared about equality. I had less and less involvement with the Trust after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge came to visit us at my request a few years ago but I was making progress in the House of Lords in other ways. The next big thing to happen was when then Prime Minister, Theresa May, told me she agreed my request for a Stephen Lawrence Day. The day she made the official announcement in St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square was one of the proudest days of my le. For Stephen and for others like him. Before him and since him. Innocent lives whose loss is now being recognised fully and properly. I realised I wanted to bring all the forces of good together, all the support I had received over  years into a day for all marginalised people who have suffered disadvantage or prejudice. The Day itself will be a culmination and celebration of activities and programmes that will run across the year. I wanted those forces of good to stand proud on a day which says: “Are we going back to the bad old days when it took a fight to get justice for a boy killed for doing nothing wrong ” No. We are not. And I realised I wanted to be hands-on in achieving this important national day – which defies anyone who still thinks, “What’s all the fuss about some black teenager being killed years and years ago ” I want such people to feel so out of step with their own country – as it celebrates a le like Stephen’s cut short by racist violence – that they know they are isolated in a tiny minority. Because the rest of the country is on our side, on the side of justice. So I decided to leave the Trust and start a standalone body specically aimed at making Stephen Lawrence Day a highlight of the year. A day for everyone with a cause which deserves justice. And a day of celebration of what we have achieved – across that year, until that year – and what we are going to achieve in the future. People kept asking me to say something about the Black Lives Matter movement and the protests after George Floyd was murdered by police in America. But I’ve always believed in action rather than words so I was busy building a new organisation which will say loudly and clearly on a UK national day for everyone that black lives matter. Black lives always matter, of course, and we’ll hold events, activities and build relationships which will shout this loudly across the whole year, every year.  That will be more effective than a few quotes from me stating the obvious that I detest and deplore the waste of innocent black lives… of any young le, any injustice. The BLM cause was well supported in the UK after George’s murder when thousands defied lockdown to take to the streets. I applauded their motives. They care and they are right to care. They put their lives at risk for what they believed in by going out marching. This country has been blighted by racism over the years and they were right to highlight the fact that the creativity and experience of black people has helped to build this country into what it is today. But marching and protesting is not for all of us and many people could not take those risks during a pandemic. As we know, black, Asian and ethnic minorities are especially at risk and lives have been lost. Next April, Stephen Lawrence Day will allow thousands of people, from the very young to the very old, families and friends to show the world that black lives matter by attending our national events. And this won’t be an improvised protest it will be an official Day, a nationwide expression against injustice and cruelty a celebration of tolerance and ersity. It will be a day for all disadvantaged sections of society, for everyone who has suffered prejudice or injustice.

While some have been wearing masks for several weeks now, it will be a new experience for others - and many people have questions about them. Weaposve spoken to two experts to learn more about some of the things people are concerned about, including how they work, what type of mask they should buy and how to wear them. Theyaposve also revealed the common mistakes people make when wearing masks, and explain why home made masks can only be worn for four hours. GP Dr Dawn Harper told : Whilst we are all enjoying the easing of lockdown, we must be mindful that the virus is still very much around. We are getting new cases every day and sadly people are still losing their lives to this hideous disease, so we need to do everything we can to protect ourselves and those around us. Infectious disease consultant Carolyn Hemsley adds that itaposs vital for us to wear masks to protect people we come into contact with while out and about. She tells : Face coverings and masks have a very important public health role and are crucial to our ability to fight the spread of SARS-CoV. They reduce the spread of this virus.  Do masks work and how do they work Carolyn Hemsley explains: SARS-CoV- is present in the respiratory secretions of the infected inidual. When that inidual coughs they expel respiratory droplets carrying the virus into the local environment. The infection is transmitted when these droplets come into contact with the mouth or nasal and respiratory passages of a susceptible inidual close by. The droplets containing virus also fall to the ground contaminating surfaces that can then be picked up by a susceptible inidual who touches the contaminated surface and then touches their nose or mouth transmitting the virus that way. Wearing a mask has two very useful roles. It protects one’s mouth and respiratory passages preventing the virus from reaching them and it also crucially reduces the spread of respiratory droplets from an infected inidual. Not all masks are the same. The amount of protection given by any particular face covering or mask is linked to type of fabric it is made from and that fabric’s ability to block or capture micro particles and droplets. The most efficacious masks are close fitting, water resistant and block % of droplets. In a healthcare setting we use surgical face masks and very close fitting masks such as FFP masks to protect the wearer but these should really be for one use only they are not washable or reusable. In public places most people wear reusable cloth face coverings. These have less protection for the wearer but have the benefit of reducing droplet spread and sustainability.  However, PPE, such as Wise Protec, has been proven to destroy .% of the virus in just a few minutes of contact.Do homemade masks work Many people have been making their own masks, so we asked Carolynthey are effective enough to wear when out and about. She said: Homemade mask are very valuable in reducing the spread of droplets from an infected wearer. Depending on the fabric it will also have ying ability to protect the wearer.All masks will protect people around the wearer to some degree as they reduce amount of respiratory droplets expelled and available to contaminate of the local environment. Masks that are water resistant and are efficient are blocking droplets also have the ability to protect the wearer. How much is the risk reducedyou are wearing a mask  This is really dficult to answer with any certainty, nothing is % perfect and certainly nothing works without the addition of hand washing or use of hand sanitiser. People mustn’t forget to clean their hands. There is little point of protecting your face with a mask only to contaminate it with your dirty hands as you adjust or remove itWho do face masks actually protect  Dr Harper explains: As more people are going out practicing social distancing at metres may become impractical. Wearing a face covering will protect others, should you be out and unwittingly shedding the virus - we know that people can be shedding virus for a couple of days before they develop symptoms and lots of people have the virus without displaying any symptoms, so just because you feel well does not mean you are not a risk to others.   Wearing a face mask with a CE mark also conveys some protection to the wearer The less we spread the virus between ourselves, the fewer people will be infected so it is of paramount importance that everyone adheres to the rules and does their bit to protect themselves and others. In order to make sure they are effective - how should you wear a mask She explains: Find yourself a mask that is comfortable to wear. Fabric masks are often softer and easier to wear.

But two days later, she was served with an eviction notice – dated for after the Government eviction ban ends on August . The housing charity Shelter is warning of “a wave of homelessness” from that date and says , renters may be at risk of ‘Covid-eviction’ when the Government ban ends. Despite warnings from housing charities, Parliament went home for the summer this week without resolving the issue. By the time MPson September , the eviction suspension order will have expired by nine days – leaving some families facing winter on the streets. “I honestly don’t know what we are going to do,” Jeanny, , says. “One of my children has autism so really struggles with change. The rental market here has gone crazy. There’s nothing. I’m lying awake at night worrying myself sick because at this moment we have nowhere to go.” Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, says the Secretary of State for Housing, Robert Jenrick, promised nobody would lose their home due to coronavirus. “But that promise has been shattered,” she says. “The Government has gone on its summer break having failed to make the vital tweaks to the law that are needed to properly protect renters. “A wave of homelessness is coming. Hundreds of thousands of people could lose their homes following the evictions ban lting on August . Some people could even face sleeping on the streets this winter.”  This week we spoke to three working mums, all of whom now face eviction. Sarah – not her real name – has lived with her grown-up disabled daughter, Alison, in a rented property in Greater Manchester, for two years. The women both work in a factory, and Sarah also has two cleaning jobs. They had previously been model tenants but are now being threatened with eviction. “It’s been awful,” Sarah, , says. “Two weeks ago, my daughter took a load of tablets because of it all and had to be admitted to hospital. They’re still saying they’re going to evict us. “I’ve come back late at night from my evening cleaning job, and the landlord has had people sat outside the house. I think they’re trying to intimidate us. I don’t know where we’re going to go.”  The women fell short with their rent after Alison, who has arthritis in her spine, had a fall at work, and Sarah’s cleaning work dried up because of Covid-. “We spoke to the agent to seewe could pay extra the month after and sent a copy of the sick note,” Sarah says. “We just wanted a bit of time. But two days later a letter arrived to say we were being evicted.” Shelley,  – who also asked us to change her name – rents in the Wirral with her four children. Her income, as a self-employed cleaner who also takes in ironing, was drastically hit by lockdown. She got a month behind with rent but caught up again. Even so, her landlord says he now wants the property back.  “As soon as we get to August , I’ll have to leave but I don’t have anywhere to go,” Shelley says. “I spoke to Shelter because I was worried thatI don’t have anywhere to live, they might try and take my kids off me. The demand on houses locally is ridiculous. I’ve been so stressed by it all. My mental health has been really bad – I ended up at the doctor’s because it was making me ill. It feels like the whole world is falling apart. A roof over your head is safety, and we don’t have that.” Jeanny is studying for a masters degree and tops up her student loans working at a Clarks shoe shop, but hours have been dficult to come by.

Jenner Carr was hugely disappointed when the meat and animal product free dish she ordered arrived at her table at Center Parcs in Sherwood Forest. The -year-old had forked out £ for a vegan start to her day but was not rewarded with the kind of sumptuous plate she was expecting. What arrived was half a cooked tomato, half a slice of toast, one mushroom, two hash browns, beans and four slices of pepper. To rub salt into the wound, Jenneraposs son received a meat based full English that was considerably bigger for the same price.The items he received barely fit onto the plate. Jenner, from Stirling, Scotland, would go on to be let down further by a vegan dish at the parkaposs Pancake House. It consisted solely of raw vegetables inside a crepe, she said.I was really quite shocked. It was pretty small, so we had to order extra mushrooms, beans and tomatoes on top, Jenner said, The Sun reported. When we ordered on the app, it gave us the option of making the vegetarian breakfast vegan so we chose that, but that just meant they removed the egg and the vegetarian sausage and substituted them with four small slices of pepper - not even an extra mushroom. I looked at it and thought, Iaposve paid ten pounds for this, and we were starving afterwards. A spokesperson for Center Parcs said that the breakfast was clearly not up to our usual high standards. They added: We are in the process of reviewing our vegan offering and will be introducing new dishes very soon. It was announced yesterday that Center Parcs will be cutting the prices of stays across its British centres until . Cost reductions in on-site restaurants will also be implemented.

The case was dogged by alleged attempts to frustrate the investigation and fears over jury nobbling. Throughout the case, supporters of the teenagers - Henry Long, , Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both  - crowded into the public gallery of the Old Bailey. Driver Long had already admitted manslaughter and was found not guilty of murder today. Passengers Cole and Bowers were found guilty of manslaughter but cleared of murder.  The trial was brought to a halt by Mr Justice Edis over to intimidate jurors. And a juror was dismissed after she was ruled to be overly friendly to the defendants after being seen saying bye boys as she left court. Early in the case person in the public gallery overlooking the courtroom - who has not been identied - was seen pointing at jurors. He said police had received information that an attempt is being considered by associates of the defendants to intimidate the jury. The judge gave no further details.Defence barrister Timothy Raggatt QC dismissed the incident as a touch oversensitive. In the absence of the jury, he said: In the circumstances, someone could be pointing for all sorts of reasons. Take, for example, there appear to be a lot of ladies in this court. But Mr Justice Edis ordered extra security measures to protect the jury. The jury was provided with a private room, and anyone entering the public gallery was asked to provide proof of their identity. A third measure was kept secret.  Jurors were also referred to by number rather than their name to be sworn in. And unormed police were out in force during a jury visit to rural Berkshire. Officers lined the narrow country roads as the jury viewed the spot where Pc Harper was killed. A police drone buzzed overhead as detectives jump-started the defendantsapos battered old Seat Toledo as the jury moved on.  With the end of the retrial in sight, fears for its integrity surfaced on July . An overly friendly juror was seen by a prison officer to mouth Bye boys to the defendants in the dock. On being alerted to the incident, Mr Justice Edis said: She must have been compelled by some strong motive to have behaved as she did in this court under the observation of so many. It was both overt and covert at the time, which is remarkable behaviour.  The female juror was discharged just a day before the remaining  men and women began deliberating on their verdicts. The court heard that the initial investigation had been met with a wall of silence. Detectives quickly tracked down the car which dragged Pc Harper to his death in Berkshire to the Four Houses Corner travellersapos site. But the investigation was hampered by family and friends of the occupants, who were all said to have close ties to the site.

Alongside the images of Phoebe surrounded by pink balloons and presents, they wrote: Massive happy th birthday to Phoebe. We hope you have a lovely day sweetheart. The couple live with  of their  children in a converted care home in Morecambe, Lancashire. The family, who run a bakery, is set to getting even bigger when daughter Millie, , gives birth in September. Making the most of lockdown and the glorious sunshine, the Radfords have completely transformed their garden into what one fan has described as a gorgeous family oasis. A new play park, bar and most recently the outdoor pizza oven have been added. Speaking last week about the new hot tub, Sue said: We basically got this because we are not going on holiday to Australia in a few weeks time so we thought: aposwell weaposre not having a holiday until much later in the yearapos so we thought this would be a a nice holiday for the kids. They can get a lot of enjoyment out of this while they are not in school.  She added: When we went for Tillieaposs last hospital appointment the surgeon said, because the hydrotherapy pool is closed at the moment, what is really good for helping Tillieaposs leg heal, is a hot tub. So I came home and said: aposeven the surgeon said it would be good for us to get a hot tub! When Millie announced she was expecting she said she as worried as Sue was  week pregnant with her nd birthday with husband Noel.  She said: “My parents have always seen me as the ‘good girl’.

During the episode, viewers are taken on a roller coaster ride as they watch the project cause a great amount of stress for all those involved - and one of the builders tragically dies before he can see the completed efforts of his labour. Harry and Briony Anscombe were the couple with visions of creating a structure similar to A James Speyeraposs Ben Rose House featured in Ferris Bueller - despite never having seen the actual house before. Presenter Kevin McCloud spent time with the pair, learning how they had moved out of London  months earlier and now wanted to set down their roots in Cornwall and build a dream pad. The project, which took place on the site of a former dairy farm, ended up taking longer than theyaposd hoped and the team ended up taking a number of gambles. One big blow came early on in the episode when McCloud revealed that their budget of £, wouldnapost give them a proper replica of the film house - theyaposd need to double their moneythat was what they truly wanted.  Despite this, Harry and builders Ken and Mark, decided they would carry on, making some changes to the plan, meaning the end result wouldnapost be quite the same as the house which a Ferrari famously crashed through the windows of. However the set backs kept on coming, with the Beast from the East causing them trouble and a wrong measurement setting their schedule back weeks. But the worst was yet to happen. As the construction work continued, the team arrived on site one morning to discover that Ken Pearce, one of the builders, had died suddenly in his sleep. He was always so patient with us, we asked stupid questions every day and he’d put up with it and teach us in his charming Cornish way, said Harry. He wasnapost just a builder he was a friend of the family too.  Fourteen months after they started, the house, called Natural Bridges, was completed and a memorial stone with the words Built , Ken Pearce was installed outside the property as a tribute to their friend. The finished build featured some noticeable dferences from the Ferris Bueller house - the most obvious of which is that it is made from less glass and instead has more walls in the form of Siberian larch cladding.

Those who refuse to wear one, without good reason, could be fined up to £.Similar rules are in place all around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic and as a result weaposve seen some people wearing rather bizarre makesht face coverings. Most recently a woman has been spotted wearing a cardboard KFC box over her head to cover her nose and mouth. A video of the unusual look, seen in Westfield Marion shopping mall at Oaklands Park in Adelaide on Thursday, was shared online where it quickly went viral. More than , people have watched the clip, with thousands liking it. Amused viewers shared their thoughts on the strange face covering in the comments. One person said: If you canapost find any in the shops. Another suggested her friend copy the look, writing: If you canapost find one for your flight... A third asked: Why not the bucket  with eye holes of course.  As well as a KFC box, one person was also spotted with a paper bag over their head as they headed to the shops. The man cut two holes in the bag, so he could see. It gets weirder still, with a train passenger capturing a photo of a fellow commuter wearing a pair of knickers on his face as a mask. A photo of the unusual face covering was taken on the DART to Howth by Cian Brady.

There#s barely been a spare minute.#But I#m not complaining because we#re doing our bit to make sure football and every other business s in a safe manner throughout.#We manufacture revolutionary anti-viral and sanitising products for decontaminating and sanitising all football training equipment like balls, markers, poles, goals etc.“The product range we have is also fantastic for inside and outside the stadium – changing rooms, showers, offices team coaches and mini buses.#Nobody ever thought we would have to take such steps but it#s the reality now and we can#t be too careful.#The clubs I speak to are so supportive. They realise the necessity of it all and are taking every step required to make everyone safe.#It works from the Premiership right down the isions, including junior and amateur isions to boys and girls club football.#Soutar has suffered like everyone  in the absence of any competitive action since mid-March but the ex-Ross County ace is counting down the days to next Saturday#s top-flight curtain-raiser.He added: #Having retired after  years playing football I#ve now found a job I love.#It#s great to be able to use my knowledge and experience from both careers to help clubs at this time.#This is going to be the #new norm’. It will take time to adapt and I can help with that.#Every player, manager, coach and supporter has found the last few months so hard without football.#We#re all in the same boat as we love football. It#s what we#ve been brought up on and it#s what we live for at weekends.#So I#m just glad to be playing my own part in helping get things back up and running.#It#s still an exciting time even though it#s going to be dferent.“From my point of view, I would to see Dundee back in the Premiership at the end of this campaign – in a safe way of course.#GEORGE CRAN: Wage cut agreement a big step for Dundee but still a long road ahead\" title\"#GEORGE CRAN: Wage cut agreement a big step for Dundee but still a long road ahead# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp george-cran-wage-cut-agreement-a-big-step embed # secretXnNEgxDZVD\" data-secret\"XnNEgxDZVD\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We are now monitoring noise levels as they gradually increase in response to easing of lockdown restrictions.Dr Cornwell said they are planning to look at seismic noise in the future and hopes people in Aberdeen can be an active part of it.He said: “I am pleased to have played a role in an unprecedented seismological global collaboration that has integrated ‘citizen science’ and research data.“It is encouraging that data recorded here in Aberdeen has been valuable in the context of other studies, in particular Dr Lecocq’s latest research on worldwide seismic noise trends, and I plan to build on this work by establishing a ‘citizen science’ network in Aberdeen to monitor future seismic noise fluctuations.“The Covid- pandemic has brought considerable challenges for people across the world, but has also provided a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of the links between human activity and seismic noise.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/07/SCV-logo-white-940x471.jpg ","title":"silver city vault looking back at aberdeen beach","story":"This week we#ve teamed up with the Silver City Vault for a special Aberdonian focusing on the city#s stunning beach.Aberdeen Libraries# Local Studies collection contains thousands of photographs of the city.The service is committed to making all of these images available via the Silver City Vault.Many can already be  seen at www.silvercityvaults.org.uk and in the gallery below we#ve featured some of their views of Aberdeen#s parks. vw, px\"  To explore more of the city’s history, visit the Silver City Vault: http:www.silvercityvault.org.uk For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,In publishing the opinion piece #All lives matter# from your contributor on page  of the June  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, you have demonstrated a profound lack of understanding of the current Black Lives Matter protests.The tone-deaf piece is an attempt by your contributor to shut down engagement and perpetuate ignorance.How anybody can make the claim that all lives matter after witnessing such horric police brutality is beyond belief.All lives cannot matter until Black Lives Matter.Instead of deflecting and diluting the conversation, surely it is time to educate ourselves about what is happening, and to fight systemic injustice Madeleine Conn, ArdrishaigSir,The SNP continues to demonstrate its economic incompetence.New figures show the SNP government underspent its budget by a quarter of a billion pounds in -, and failed to use £ million of borrowing capacity. ​Instead of demanding further borrowing powers and more funding from the UK Government, the separatists should learn to use the resources they already have.With such colossal mismanagement, it#s no surprise that even senior SNP advisor Andrew Wilson has stated that Scotland is set to be the worst performing economy in the developed world. Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and,the outer rim of the p piece is obscured the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel.

east end of High Street, it would be ldquoconverting part of Elcho Green to a temporary car park to support access to the High Street area.It stated that ldquofollowing a meeting with local traders, North Berwick CommunityCouncil and North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, agreement has been reached to introduce a number of temporary measures in the town ndash but both the community council and area partnership told the Courier they had not given backing to the Elcho Green changes.The councilrsquos own timetable had Elcho Green car park opening last Friday .An online petition, West Bay not Parking Bay, to ldquoprotect stunning and iconic West Bay in North Berwick, was launched by resident Sarah Russell and had attracted more than , signatures in less than a week.It said: ldquoEast Lothian Council have announced plans to turn Elcho Green into a longstay car park.ldquoWhilst the council state that this is a temporary measure to comply with their Covid Spaces for People initiative, it is greatly feared that this will, in fact, lead to a permanent car park in the most iconic seafront location in East Lothian.\"North Berwick residents and visitors alike will be robbed of the very essence of this beautul recreational space that personies this famous conservation area seafront.ldquoTemporary or otherwise, Elcho Green is not the correct location for any car parking and we would urge you to help us stop this environmental catastrophe.Among those supporting the campaign was world-famous golfer and North Berwick resident Catriona Matthew, captain of Europersquos winning Solheim Cup team.The Courier has been swamped with letters and emails against the plans .The scheme was described as ldquoindefensible and ldquoundemocratic vandalism by some residents, while many asked why there had not been specic consultation on the plan and highlighted that the land had been gted to the town by the late Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple for recreational use in .On Monday, East Lothian Council released a statement that it was placing the ldquoElcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.It is the second time in a month that the councilrsquos plans to transform town centres have hit the buffers.Earlier in July, proposals to suspend parking in town centres were put ldquoon hold after traders and residents in Haddington reacted with anger as cones and parking suspension signs were put up overnight, sparking widespread concern.In Mondayrsquos statement, Councillor Norman Hampshire , environment spokesperson, said: ldquoEast Lothian Council has successfully implemented a number of physical distancing measures on North Berwick High Street to support the need for safe access to the town centre and economic recovery.ldquoA further support for Spaces for People was a proposal to utilise a small part of Elcho Green in North Berwick as a temporary car park.ldquoThe benefit of this would have been a reduction in the number of vehicles circling and queuing for parking spaces, enhanced safety for pedestrians and cyclists within the town centre, and improved air quality.ldquoEast Lothian Council is a listening authority and we are aware of the ious perspectives being raised within the North Berwick community.ldquoAs such, we intend to place the Elcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.\"This delay will also enable us to monitor the impact of increased traffic as a result of visitors and to assess the effectiveness of measures introduced.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said that recent u-turns were down to a ldquolack of political leadership within the Labour administration.He said he received more than  emails objecting to the Elcho Green plans.He called for a report on the Spaces for People plans, and in particular parking proposals in North Berwick, to be put before a meeting of elected council group leaders in two weeksrsquo time for approval.Under emergency Covid- procedures, normal council business is currently suspended and decisions are taken at monthly meetings of the group leaders and council chief executive.He said: ldquoThe decision must be approved by councillors at the leadersrsquo group meeting and it should be open and transparent and open to the press.Mr Hampshire accused Mr Currie of ldquoplaying politics in ldquoan emergency situation.ldquoWe have allowed him to take part in the meetings with officers at every point during the discussions, said Mr Hampshire.ldquoI have got to say the Conservative Group have been fully behind what we are doing.\"For the SNP to try to play politics in a situation where their own Government is instructing local authorities to create spaces in town centres is unbelievable.Conservative councillor Craig Hoy called on the administration to ldquotake notice of the recent problems caused by parking proposals.He said the Scottish Government had failed to give councils enough time to push through emergency Covid measures in town centres.Councillor Hoy said: \"Scottish Councils are operating under huge pressure with limited resources, but that does not remove the need for them to consult fully and communicate clearly on big issues which impact our communities.\"I hope East Lothian Council and the Labour administration will take notice of the recent problems in North Berwick and fully engage with stakeholders.\"Hilary Smith, chair of North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, stressed that the area partnership had not attended any meeting regarding Covid- plans for the town or given its approval to the plans.North Berwick Community Council said it had not discussed Elcho Green prior to its

Berwick.In response to questions from the Courier, the council said: ldquoThe high school and sports centre are both due to re-open in coming weeks so were unsuitable to use.ldquoAn area of Elcho Green is considered suitable to take traffic arriving from the west to park for people visiting the town to intercept the flow of traffic and stop vehicles circulating through the town unnecessarily searching for parking spaces and generating additional traffic pollution.ldquoIt also seemed reasonable considering the area of land is used annually for Fringe by the Sea events.\"A maximum of

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

spin-offs from the  film of the same name - we have followed the two loveable rogues as they get themselves into all sorts of sticky situations.Particularly memorable storylines include the teenagers attempt to steal a giant tuna fish from the market in series one, and when they got expelled after stripping off in the classroom and peeing on Principal Walshs leg in series two.Now were getting a series three, in which we see the lads trying to make their way as young adults, with yet more questionable methods of making some money, all while Jock navigates being a new dad.One things for sure things wont go smoothly.Here, we chat to Walley and Murphy, plus Hilary Rose - who plays Conors stressed-out but loving mum, Mairead - to find out more.NEW CHAPTERIts an unconventional family set-up in The Young Offenders, which is set and filmed in Cork.A heart-warming episode in series one saw widower Maireadbecome a foster mum to Jock - whose mum is also dead - after he escapes his abusive, alcoholic dad.At the end of series two, Jocks girlfriend Siobhan - whose dad happens to be Principal Walsh, who is far from the biggest fan of Jock and Conor - gave birth to baby Star .The new addition to the family means Principal Walsh and his we Orla - whose other daughter Linda is going out with Conor - now have to engage more with Mairead, which hasnt always gone well in the past.\"Season three was interesting from a character point of view because Mairead really cuts loose and, at some stages, the lads are telling her to calm down!\" follows Rose, whos also from Cork, and married Peter Foott - who created The Young Offenders - since .As for the love story between her and Sergeant Healy, she teases \"season three kinda continues that on-again, off-again, will they, wont they vibe\".The main storyline for series two is how Jock is adjusting to everyday le with baby Star.\"Conor and Jock are still getting into their sticky situations but now theres just a baby there as well,\" reveals Walley.\"I think its just a major sht in their lives and theyre just trying to figure it out all together.\"PARENTING LESSONSTwins Nola and Penny Richardson shared the role of Star, and Walley says the babies were \"incredible\".\"I want one!\" exclaims Murphy, before quickly adding \"not right now\".Rose chimes in at this point, saying she has told the boys they are always welcome to babysit her kids .\"Theyre both amazing babysitters, but there was a time when Jake was very young where they bought him a nerf gun,\" she recalls, which sets them all off laughing, with her on-screen sons looking a little sheepish.\"I dunno, we were buying toys and we were like, This is what kids that age like!\" reasons Walley.\"There was some force off ityou shot it,\" he concedes. \"Theyre heavy-duty.\"\"That was a real Conor and Jock moment for the two of us,\" admits Murphy.Having Penny and Nola on set this series was definitely a learning curve for the young actors.\"I was terried of holding babies for fear I dropped them,\" confides Walley. \"By the end of the shoot, I just was inseparable.\"MEMORABLE MOMENTSAccording to Murphy, \"theres not a street in Cork city that we havent filmed on\".\"The Cork people are so proud of the show.\"Having crowds watching them film was something they \"had to get used to pretty quick.\"\"There was a great photo in the paper a few years ago, of us making the film there are about  people in the crew, no-ones watching us filming,\" notes Murphy.\"And then there was a photo of us making season , and there were just crowds of people watching.\"It was good, it was like doing a play every day, whenever we were filming outside in the city.\"One of the new episodes sees Jock, Conor and Mairead take a trip to Dublin.Whilst filming on a road in the Irish capital city, they reveal they were pulled over by Leo Varadkars entourage as he was driving past them in an unmarked executive car.The Irish politician was taoiseach at the time .\"There was a camera in the back seat, and we were mid-scene and we were like, What does this guy want  Were filming!\" says Rose.\"And eventually Alex put down the passenger window and was like Hey!, and next thing Leo Varadkar leaned forward!\"\"His driver was like, Great show!\" recalls Murphy. \"We were like, Do you like it [to Varadkar] And he went, I havent seen it!\"\"But he did say, Ive heard its great\", adds Rose.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTThe biggest thing Rose has taken away from making The Young Offenders is the amazing relationships theyve formed with cast and crew .\"Its about getting the job done and doing the best that you can, but you have to remember as well, for actors, were really vulnerable in front of all the crew, so you kinda put your trust in them,\" she elaborates.\"If were doing emotional scenes, theyre witnessing it, theyre trying to support you.\"As for future series, Murphy points out the only issue could be that he and Walley dont exactly look  anymore.\"At some points in the script, Jock will go, We cant do that, were only , and we were like, Can we just not mention our age \" he continues, chuckling.\"As long as we look young, I guess well see what happens.

In one sense, everyonersquos property is off limits without permission, as it is anywhere . Unless, that is, yoursquore an apple-scrumping child ndash and which of us has never been  At this stage of le a garden with fruit trees is excellent training for a career in the SAS ndash get in, achieve mission and scarper without trace or casualties. Part of the allure of these raids, as I recall, is not just the trepidation of trespassing, but of taking forbidden fruit. Usually we gathered the unripe apples and stone-hard pears as ammunition for our long-running battles, rather than as a source of vitamin C. If kids ever clamber over the fence for our apples, theyrsquod be more than welcome. If they could also pick the crab apples and turn them into jam that would be appreciated.Many aspects of le are very dferent this summer from last, but one thing has not changed. Regardless of the lurgy, fruit is ripening fast on bushes and trees the high season of berries is upon us. One of the most vivid memories of our first August here was sitting in a friendrsquos summerhouse and suddenly seeing three folk emerging from the far end of their garden. Each was clutching a bowl heaped with jewel-like fruits, and as they passed it was aswersquod glimpsed the three Magi.A few days ago, we were invited into the same garden, to help ourselves to raspberries. It had been a day of torrential rain, with intermittent sun. The sky was darkening as we made our way between the rows, which were heavy with fat sweet rasps. When the rain began, I put up my hood, and picked on. The scent of wet leaves and trodden earth was intoxicating, a bouquet richer than a Barola. These bushes had been growing here long before our friends arrived,  years ago. They are kept company by apple and pear trees, redcurrant bushes, and plums that, when ripe, hang from the branches like ear-rings. Therersquos also a large bed of still-ripening strawberries. One year I watched a mouse, on tiptoe, nibbling a dangling berry.Irsquove rarely tasted better raspberries than the ones we collected, their flavour enhanced by the atmosphere of the garden where they grew. Being allowed access to this most beautul, out of the way corner reminds me a little of The Secret Garden. That book that made such an impression on me as a girl that I drove my parents nuts begging to be allowed to buy a derelict Victorian walled garden close by. I would climb onto the seat by the bus stop to look over its wall and plan how Irsquod clear it of weeds and shattered glass house and fill it with vegetables and flowers. Since Irsquod shown no desire to lt so much as a dandelion in our own back yard, I was told to dream on.The garden where we, and others, are invited to forage is a perfect complement to the fields and hills beyond. Flowerbeds, graceful trees and a croquet-style lawn coexist seamlessly with fruit and, previously, rows of vegetables too. When people picture the rural idyll, itrsquos often a rose-festooned house where hollyhocks run amok. Yet the true cottage garden was never chocolate-box pretty but a place where leeks and cabbages grew among primroses and poppies ndash more Mr McGregor than Vita Sackville-West. That is still the case. In one of my favourite Hoolet gardens, a formal square bed of roses encloses a profusion of succulent young lettuces, ready to lt for lunch.This is an artful nod to where all such cultivation began. Originally, humble countryside plots were essential sources of food there was no room for unproductive and time-consuming grass, or patios where clematis and wisteria rambled towards dormer windows, choking the gutters. Wholly utilitarian, they contained rectangular beds devoted to cabbages and potatoes and, weather permitting, caned trellises for fruit. These were beautul in their own way, but it was only when flowers escaped from hedgerows and colonised the margins and spaces between the plots that they gained nostalgic postcard charm.The plant collector, Major Lawrence Johnston, is responsible for redefining the cottage garden. In the early th century, when he and his mother moved into Hidcote Manor in the Cotswolds, he took the idea of a rural plot, edited its contents, and scaled it up. The result, with winding paths, artistic focal points, and teeming, colourful borders, had the appearance of being haphazard, random and accidental, when in fact it was rigorously planned. It sounds spectacular. Increasingly, though, Irsquom coming to think that outdoor spaces designed solely to please the eye are lacking in one vital ingredient: the kind you can put on a plate.Thanks in part to the generosity of neighbours, we too are starting to feed ourselves: redcurrants and blackcurrants, strawberries ndash still in relative infancy ndash rhubarb, carrots and herbs. Wersquore not in the league of those who can nurture asparagus Irsquom told it takes seven years for a first crop to appear. In fact, wersquore not in any league at all. After Alan dug up last yearrsquos potatoes, I replanted that bed with roses, honeysuckle and lavender. At one point in late spring, these new arrivals were suddenly swamped by a profusion of shaws, as the undetected, button-sized potatoes left buried in the winter sprouted into le. Following a striking display of flowers, we now have an unexpected crop of delicious spuds to keep us going for weeks. The satisfaction of filling your own larder is immense. Itrsquos at times like this that you realise keeping a cottage garden is a process of give and take.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Perhaps I should head across and demand payment.At any rate, we were told by all news sources yesterday, that involvement of the Russians in the independence referendum was ldquoconfirmed by the report of the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee. The evidence lay in ldquoopen source commentary it said, which was ldquocredible.The UK Government scandalously ignored evidence of similar Russian involvement in the Brexit referendum, said MPs on the committee, because it didnrsquot want to know. Surprise, surprise.But how come the committee was so sure about Russkie meddling in the Indyref, about which the Government also apparently did not want to know  Why was the ldquoopen source commentary ldquoso compelling  After all, such commentary is just what people had been saying in published sources.There was no shortage of ldquoopen source commentary during Brexit from any number of commentators, such as the prolic Carole Cadwalladr in the Observer, who reported that senior Brexiters were in regular contact with Russian diplomats and business interests. Why did the committee disown all that The implication was that the true Indyref smoking gun was in the classied annex to yesterdayrsquos report. According to the former UK National Security Adviser, Sir Mark Lyell Grant, interviewed on BBC World At One, it was ldquowell known that the Russians were ldquoamplying social media messages during the  campaign. Well known by whom The published report refers only to claims about voting irregularities made after the  referendum and designed to discredit the result. It also referred obliquely to newspaper speculation about cybernat ldquoMcBots punting Russian propaganda.It rather looked asthe Labour and Conservative MPs on the committee were only able to agree on one thing: that the Russians were obviously all over the Scottish independence referendum and that the Government should have taken better note.According to the Labour MP, Kevan Jones, at yesterdayrsquos ISC press conference, the UK Government ignored the ldquoflashing lights from  and turned a blind eye to evidence that similar Russian ldquomeddling had occurred in the Brexit referendum in . Perhaps surprisingly, SNP MP Steward Hosie, who is also on the committee, took up the theme with alacrity. He chastised successive UK governments for not acting on known Russian involvement in the Scottish independence referendum: ldquoIt must have been clear that had they looked for similar evidence [in Brexit] it would have been extraordinarythey had not reached the same conclusions.Questioned later about this on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Hosie said that he was only able to talk about what was in the unredacted report, not the secret annex. Thatrsquos all very well, but it leaves a nasty smell over the entire referendum campaign.I think we can all agree that the UK is ndash as the report put it ndash ldquoa top target for Russian security and intelligence services. But the activities of the IRA, the Internet Research Agency, which is assumed to be the perpetrator of these electoral dirty tricks, are almost incidental to the more serious activities of the Russian state. After all, it is widely assumed to have been conducting assassinations on UK soil using some of the most toxic agents known. This was against former KGB spies Alexander Litvinov and Sergei Skripal. These were terrorist actions and clearly a priority for the UKrsquos intelligence and security forces.But social media influencing is a rather dferent kettle of spooks. What I mainly recall from  were the widespread claims of vote-rigging and dirty tricks, not by the Kremlin but by MI. Many SNP supporters on Twitter believe the Alex Salmond sex case was orchestrated by the UK secret service.If, as the ISC committee recommended yesterday, MI spooks should now be actively investigating and judging social media posts during election campaigns, then yet more mistrust and paranoia will assuredly be the result. Why so sure  Because they are already doing this.It was revealed in  that the Institute for Statecraft, and its protege the Integrity Initiative, funded by the UK Foreign Office, was already battling Vladimir Putinrsquos social media meddling from the improbable location of a disused mill in Fe. The Integrity Initiative is all about countering ldquodisinformation and malign influence from Russia, which increasingly originates online.However, these hapless hacktivists strayed disastrously into domestic politics. The Integrity Initiative had to apologise to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, for retweeting messages suggesting that he was one of Mr Putinrsquos ldquouseful idiots. Itrsquos not clear which of the institutersquos , tweets were alleging this, but we can guess.Ms Cadwalladr had claimed in  that senior members of the Labour Party including Jeremy Corbynrsquos communications director, Seumas Milne, were Russian patsies. ldquoMilnersquos support of Russia is like Faragersquos, she tweeted in December . ldquoTherersquos nothing hidden. Itrsquos completely overt.This is the problem with trying to fight a propaganda war on social media. Even more than conventional spying it is a hall of mirrors. Paranoia feeds paranoia. In calling for the intelligence services to start investigating election campaigns, the ISC committee is asking for something the spooks dearly want to avoid.Take Labourrsquos ldquoNHS for sale dossier, which became a major story in the  General Election campaign. This first appeared on the Reddit website. That websitersquos own security analysts claimed that, while the documents on Britainrsquos trade negotiations with the US were genuine, they were put into the public domain by Russian sources.Do we seriously want MI judging the veracity and origins of every election issue  Arguably, yesterdayrsquos ISC report was itself an exercise in political propaganda serving to taint the  referendum with Russian involvement. Yet there is precisely no evidence, compelling or otherwise, that this had any impact on the result. Keep spooks out of politics.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Westminster is rotten and corrupt, politics is rotten and corrupt, the social system is rotten and corrupt, but nothing will ever change.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.IN the absence of theatre, at least we are being offered some farce in the British security services Russia Report.Russia is supposed to have pursued a social media campaign on Brexit and independence, and the first joke is why did it bother  Was it so out of touch  The UK public, having been bombarded for years on a daily basis with anti-EU propaganda, hardly needed any additional tweets. The security services should have been investigating those interfering billionaires, Rupert Murdoch, Jonathan Harmsworth, David and Frederick Barclay. These are the men who wield great power through the Sun, Mail, and the , and their propaganda skills are far superior to a few Russians in a back office.In the Scottish independence referendum, almost all the press was extremely hostile and in no way reflected the distribution of opinion among the public. But this was to some extent counter-balanced by the great peoples movement that grew, often on entirely personal initiatives, on the Yes side. They had only social media and personal contact and in their many thousands used it brilliantly. Any foreign interference on social media,it happened, was entirely superfluous. We did, of course, have some foreign interference ndash by President Obama, by Spanish politicians and some senior EU officials.No-one should ever take what any states security services produce at face value. Always assume that it is as likely to be  as true. They all have agendas. They are all engaged in mind games, it is their job. Remember Iraq, anyone  They are all hacking both friends and enemies. They are all pursuing propaganda initiatives. The US was even caught hacking Angela Merkel. So sit back and watch the show.Isobel Lindsay, Biggar.YES, there should be an investigation into interference into the  referendum. What we know is that David Cameron required UK Embassy staff to cajole foreign governments into opposing Scottish independence in . Russia reported at the time that it was one of them, and we saw the Prime Minister of Spain and the President of the United States make speeches to this effect. Irsquom sure Ian Murray and Murdo Fraser will welcome any such inquiry into this iniquity.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I FOUND that Iain Macwhirterrsquos article UKon the report on Russian interference in the sometimes clouded the main point.He jokingly suggests, in the context of the report, that since he was pro-independence for Scotland in  he might have expected some financial recognition from the Kremlin for his written articles. This acknowledges what most reasonably minded people take from the evidence emerging regarding the revelations about alleged Russian interference.I find it obvious that it is in the political interest of Russia to break apart the UK and hence weaken its strategic integral role in the world. The same argument applies to Brexit, as a Europe without the UK suits Russia. If Russia did in fact make any effective dference in the  result it must therefore have been to swell the Yes vote.What I expect has come out of this foul affair is thatthe old adage ldquoyou should not believe everything you read in the newspapers\" holds true, then it is very many times more true when the message is applied to the internet. The UK has a very long history of distrust and conflict with Russia and our alliance during the Second World War was perhaps something to be seen as an unusual blip in history.However, I find it telling that our UK Government, as some reports admit, \"took its eye off the ball in watching out for both dirty tricks from a foreign power and, I suggest, also did the same for the threat of a killer pandemic.Perhaps it is time the Westminster Government took stock of its elected role and remembered punctually in future when to lt the drawbridge.Bill Brown, Milngavie.IT seems that the Russians have been trying to influence voters in the UK by posting fake messages on social media. I do remember some ridiculous nonsense being circulated in the run-up to the  Scottish referendum. It was said that each voter in Scotland would be worth pound,they voted Yes. The figure had been arrived at by taking the estimated value of oil deposits in the North Sea and iding by the number of voters ndash aseach voter could extract the oil themselves. It was such drivel it must have come from a Russian agent.I hope that any inquiry into the distribution of misinformation at that time will uncover the source and also calculate how many people may have been duped into voting Yes by that phoney get-rich-quick fraud.Les Reid, Edinburgh EH.WITH the much-delayed and redacted report into Russian interference in two referendums finally published, I am reminded of our National Bard, who might have said \"We are bought and sold for Russian gold, such a parcel of rogues in a nation\"Alec Oattes, Ayr.Read more: Sturgeon urged to condemn Salmond for being in the pay of the Kremlin"},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-amazon-mans-wealth-skyrockets","story":"We are responsible The inidual in question is American tycoon, Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, solike many others around the world, you have been shopping online during lockdown, then you have likely contributed to the hefty rise in his worth. billion - in one day Bezos added the hefty chunk to his worth on Monday, it has emerged, which was the largest single-day jump for an inidual on record, thanks to Amazons soaraway share price - shares leapt .%, the biggest leap since December  on growing optimism about online shopping trends.His wealth is off the charts Bezos was already the worlds richest man and now, he has, in fact, seen his fortune swell  billion in  so far to a staggering  billion, and this comes despite the economic downturn resulting from lockdown.

Tai Frasier is Harriet Smith Elton is Mr Elton the vicar.It was easy to predict Emmas next move because isnt she just like Cher and, well, after  years of kinship I know exactly what Cher would do next.The film Clueless is  this year, and we are early for the celebration here due to belated UK release dates. In the US the film was screened from the July, hence a glut of \"where are the cast now \" pieces and interviews with its star, Alicia Silverstone.In the UK Clueless was released in the October, but let me creep in ahead of time with a little love letter to the movie.Watching the film was one of those seminal adolescent moments that floats around with you permanently just tickling your subconscious. It isnt the movie, only, that makes it seminal but the entire experience of the movie.I remember where I saw it, I remember who I was with, what snacks we ate and that it was the first time I was allowed to a film with a friend and without an adult chaperone. Heady times.Babe was released that year and also Pocahontas but it is Clueless that stays with me, for viewing it meant a step towards that then much desired and now much resented state of being grown up.Looking back at the headlines of  creates a bleak picture. Here, Ronnie Kray and Fred West died. A gripped nation followed the OJ Simpson trial until the not guilty verdict. The Queen urged Charles and Diana to file for orce.One bright spot seems to have been the Queen Mothers successful hip operation.As a pre-teen all this passed me by but it does make sense, against a glum backdrop, that a bright film set in bright sunshine with a sunshine protagonist would have captured positive reviews.Our heroine Cher is manipulative, she is shallow, she is ignorant. But shes relentlessly, eternally optimistic. She nicely manipulative, theres a kindness in it. She doesnt know how to be anything  but sunny.The film is very much a snapshot of a Calornian high school at a specic time and place and yet it is also curiously timeless. Its writer, Amy Heckerling, created her own teenage slang while the films costume designer Mona May invented a unique style for the films main stars, meaning that, while it is definitively teenage, it is not quite bound to a particular era.As a pre-teen it seemed entirely reasonable to me that -year-olds would be cruising around in Jeeps, using credit cards and dating college guys. It was, ironically, aspirational and part of a wider love affair with American high school le presented also in Sweet Valley High books.Everyone beautul, everyone glamorous, romance and takeaway iced coffees around every corner.The fashions were one link to acting out our Lanarkshire version of Calornia valley girl le. We bought plaid mini skirts and wore them with knee high socks, the stupid things would never stay up the way they stayed up on Cher and her best friend Dionne.We wore spaghetti-strap vests over white t-shirts. We did not wear original Alaiumla .At the time of its release, the Hollywood Reporter called Clueless, \"plotless and borderline brainless\" adding, \"But that wont stop the Paramount release from cashing in substantially with the teenage and young adult crowd.\"The first of that review is unfair - Cher may be styled as an airhead but she is not stupid, shes ignorant and these two are quite dferent. The dialogue is smart and snappy - anything but brainless and only someone whos forgotten their teenage agonies could call it anything . She is entirely responsible for herself in an admirable way. Her report card grades, for example, are ldquoa jumping-off point to start negotiations.The second is spot on - it did cash in. It did cash in - with a TV series following quickly thereafter, books, merchandise - and ironically so. Because Clueless, of course, subverts the Hollywood makeover trope by giving the beautul girl, the one others aspire to look like, an internal makeover.She realises, twee as it may be, that money and materialism are not what will give her a meaningful le. Only education and charity will. If only someone had told us we were entirely missing the central moral premise of the movie as we, for the eight millionth time that day, pulled up our knee socks and tucked down our miniskirts.Clueless was a satirical critique of empty, spoiled teenage consumerism - and it made me want to buy things.On Monday my lockdown film club had a th anniversary celebratory viewing of Clueless. Its anxiety-inducing, to re-watch something that exists as a perfect specimen in the memory. What , like Friends, another nostalgic slice of s culture, it has aged badly. Whatthe central and adored characters are actually, like Ross, deeply unlikeable  Whatthe humour relies on sexist and homophobic jokes Ah, but relief. Its still perfect. Its still fresh and witty and thoroughly enjoyable.And now,  years on, in a pandemic when -year-olds are striking against climate change as much as they hanging out at the mall when the US president has made America somewhere you feel pity for, not envy of, its the perfect time for curling up with a character built of radiant optimism.Something to give a sense of control, Cher might say, in a world full of chaos.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

In my head, I was crossing this dark swamp in the middle of the night.ldquoWe want to do everything we can to save the island and do with it what it deserves.The island comes with a derelict bungalow dating from the s, which was once the holiday home of thrill-seeking aristocrat Fiona Gore, Countess of Arran.The familyrsquos vision is to restore the Colonial-style lodge which will serve as a visitor and education centre.Elise also wants to rebuild the jetty to allow the public to safely visit, open a cafe and create a raised boardwalk which will wind through the woodland.It is hoped to offer a retreat for disabled children on the island with camping pods dotted over Inchconnachan also part of the plan.Elise said her father paid Luss Estates to live on the island as part of a deal where he would look after the properties and the land.She recalled the wallabies, especially the tamest one which she named lsquokangaroorsquo.Food shopping trips were made to Luss, where water bottles were also filled, but the islandrsquos blaeberries were also popular.Elise said her father, an inventor and writer who now lives in France, was happy on Inchconnachan although she added he did find it a little lonely at times.A recent trip there found the cabin vandalised and litter left by wild campers, she said.Elise said: ldquoThe island was put on the sale for poundK which we thought might achievable but we spoke to the estate agent a few days ago who said there had been a lot of interest already and that he didnrsquot think it would go for anything less than a million.ldquoThere is now a closing date of August  which means we need to raise double the original amount in three weeks.ldquoWhatever amount of money we receive, we will make an offer.She said the family had gone for the simplest crowdfunding model, with the deadline making it impossible to set up a charity or business in the first instance.If successful Elise said a trust will be set up to run the island.She added: ldquoIf our bid is declined for a higher offer, the money will then be used to support the John Muir Trust, Peoplersquos Trust for Endangered Species and Enable Scotland, who work with the environment, wildle, endangered species, education and people with disabilities.ldquoThis way, whether we succeed or fail, the lsquoWallaby Island Projectrsquo will have a lasting positive impact for

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.”The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr W. C. Howard, manager of Argo’s, suggested it at the first meeting of the Stromness and West Mainland Chamber of Commerce, in late June .The best time for it was the third week in July, to coincide with the Kirkwall monthly holiday and the Stromness Regatta, so it was opened by Provost George Robertson on July .Other than during the war, Stromness has always had to work hard to attract business. Provost Robertson said in his opening speech that the aim was “to keep Stromness very definitely on the shopping map” and he told an old Stromness story: “Said a business man to his neighbour, ‘How’s business the day, William ’ ‘Oh,’ replied he, ‘canna compleen, canna compleen – selt a Christian Herald, changed a penny and shawn a man whar the auld kirk is.#”The week was a resounding success. All the shops decorated their windows and offered prizes and discounts. About  flags filled the street, as everyone hung out what they could find. Merriman’s electrical shop, then half-way up Porteous Brae, hooked up loudspeakers to provide music for the passers-by.Even at such short notice, Stromness managed to get the “showies” to ert to the town. There was an amusement arcade in the Transit Shed, at the top of the North Pier, and the side-shows at the Market Green even included chairoplanes.The mystery bus tour was on Tuesday. Provost Robertson had suggested that the tour might take its passengers to “parts of the mainland you have never seen since you were last carted there to a Sunday School picnic ,  or  years ago”. He urged his audience to book but, of course, this didn’t happen and only one bus was laid on. Another five had to be hurriedly brought from Wishart’s Garage.On Wednesday there were sporting competitions at Ness, which culminated in a five-a-side hockey tournament. The men’s final, won by Dounby, was described in the Orkney Herald as being played “with a speed reminiscent of ice-hockey and an enthusiasm to win that might have been more appropriate on the battlefield”.The week also held the Stromness Regatta, a Swimming Gala, a Football Tournament, the County Sheepdog Trials and a Bring and Buy Sale in the North Kirk that raised £.The week ended, as it always has, with a fancy-dress parade. The -yard long procession was led by the Kirkwall City Pipe Band and followed by hundreds of excited spectators.  spectators lined the Market Green for the judging and presentation of prizes.In , the main attraction was the Wick Girls Pipe Band but there was plenty of home- grown entertainment. Nannie Gowans organised a concert by the youth of the town in the Town Hall. When her brother Johnnie was appointed Shopping Week organiser a few years later she ably assisted him. They are still remembered in Stromness for developing a bigger programme of events and bringing in big attractions, such as tightrope walkers, motorcycle display teams and the Globe of Death.There had not been enough time to organise the suggested art exhibition for the first Shopping Week but it was there in , organised by Stanley Cursiter, in the building now occupied by the Ell  Co Café.The Swimming Gala in the harbour included a water-polo match, “…in which it was dficult to know who was playing who” and a display of water-skiing but the big event was the March of Time cavalcade organised by the Young Farmers at the Market Green, showing how farming had developed over the centuries.“First of all came cultivation, beginning with the man with the spade and pick… We saw the genuine old wooden plough of our great-grandfathers…. The lovely and lovable Clydesdales drawing the long-boarded plough and the  tractor carrying its two-furrow at the tail and jogging along with a jaunty air.Sowing, harvesting, threshing and the farmhouse kitchen went through similar progressions, all with a commentary by JGS Flett from Harray. The final scene was the farmer in his feather bed “where he rests amid all possible blessings of State and personal luxury and indulgence.”The week ended with the parade, open air dancing and the first Shopping Week fireworks: a -minute display from the Inner Holm.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

The Islamic Emirate is ready to release all remaining prisoners of the other side before the eve of Eid al-Adha provided they release our prisoners as per our list already delivered to them. Likely, IEA is ready to begin intra-Afghan negotiations immediately after Eidmdash Suhail ShaheenJuly ,  in case the process of the release of the prisoners is completed.mdash Suhail ShaheenJuly , Javed Faisal, spokesman for the Afghan national security adviserrsquos office, previously said nearly  Taliban prisoners whose release is being sought have been convicted of serious crimes.The government is reluctant to set them free, he said.It seemed unlikely the government would free the remaining Taliban prisoners before the Muslim holiday.The release of , Taliban prisoners held by the government and , government personnel and security officials in Taliban custody is laid out in a US deal with the Taliban aimed at ending Afghanistanrsquos relentless wars.According to the deal, the prisoner exchange is to take place ahead of talks between Kabul and the Taliban, seen as perhaps the most critical part of the deal.Mr Shaheenrsquos tweet was the first offer at a timeline for the negotiations, however he demanded the prisoner release be completed first and refused any substitutes to the list of prisoners submitted by the Taliban.Kabul has offered to free alternative Taliban members they have in custody and who they say have not been convicted of serious crimes.The Taliban have refused.The governmentrsquos national reconciliation council membership has yet to be decided.It is being led by Abdullah Abdullah, a candidate in last yearrsquos presidential election who disputed the results and had for a time declared himself president.He was appointed to head the reconciliation efforts to break the political deadlock over the election, which had frustrated Washingtonrsquos efforts to get intra-Afghan negotiations off the ground.\" data-title\"Afghanistan\" data--holder\"AP\" data--notice\"AP Press Association Images\" data-credit\"STR\" data-usage-terms\"UK only\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production ebaeaebefaYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTkNjcMzU ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production ebaeaebefaYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTkNjcMzU ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production ebaeaebefaYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTkNjcMzU ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"The aftermath of a Taliban attack Meanwhile, in the Qatar capital of Doha, where the Taliban maintain a political office, the religious movement has finalised its -member negotiating team, which includes  members of the Talibanrsquos leadership council.Taliban officials who spoke previously said the strength of the team means it can make decisions on behalf of the movement.The Taliban team is also led by one of the founders of the movement, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who spent eight years in a jail in Pakistan after he attempted to open peace talks in  with then president Hamid Karzai.Mr Baradarrsquos independent peace overtures were apparently made without either Pakistanrsquos or the United Statesrsquo prior approval, according to Mr Karzai.Mr Karzai has said he twice asked Islamabad and Washington to free Mr Baradar.He was rejected both times, he said.Now, however, Mr Baradar speaks on the phone with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and was the leading negotiator in talks with US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, which resulted in a peace deal between the Taliban and the US.It was touted as Afghanistanrsquos best chance at peace in decades when it was signed on February .However, it has been bogged down over the release of prisoners.copy -.

I think the way Cardf has gone about the whole thing has been the right way. Wersquove used democratic means to take it down.ldquoMost people were incredibly supportive. They recognise the signicance of the statue and what an affront it is to black people. Black lives do matter.ldquoItrsquos therefore not appropriate to have such a person as Picton, who caused so much suffering and death and misery during his time as governor of Trinidad, commemorated and celebrated.ldquoStatues are not just about history. They are about celebrating the lives of the people they depict, and representing a certain set of values. These arenrsquot the values, hersquos not the person, and these arenrsquot the deeds we want to celebrate and recognise in Cardf today.Mr DersquoAth said the decision to remove the Picton statue had ldquospecial signicance for him due to his own family history.Irsquove written to #Cardf Council asking for the removal of the statue of sadistic th Century slave-owner, Sir Thomas Picton, from the Marble Hall in @CityHallCardf.

He was almost certainly a descendent of slaves himself, he said.ldquoIt means a lot. A huge amount to me and other black people out there in the community.An application to remove the statue from Cardf City Hall will now be made to the Welsh Government, as the building is Grade I listed.Cadw, the Welsh governmentrsquos historic environment service, will be asked to give advice, with a final decision expected to be announced near December.On Thursday evening, councillors voted to remove the statue from the Marble Hall of Heroes with  in favour, five against, and nine abstentions.The motion to have the statue removed was tabled by Labourrsquos Saeed Ebrahim, who tweeted following the vote: ldquoThe symbolism of me, a black man, tabling this motion to remove a slaver statue is not lost on me.The symbolism of me, a Black man, tabling this motion to remove a slaver statue is not lost on me.But this isnrsquot just symbolism.The taskforce that @huwthomas_Wales appointed me to Chair must lead to real change for Black  BAME people in Cardf #BlackLivesMatter @BLMCardf https:t.co GPXyxOmdash Saeed EbrahimJuly , Mr Ebrahim is chairing a task force set up by council leader Huw Thomas to work with black communities in Cardf to understand the support they want from city officials.Mr Thomas, who previously labelled the statue an ldquoaffront to Black people, said: ldquoThere have been well-publicised calls in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement for a reassessment of how iniduals in British history with involvement in slavery are commemorated.ldquoSpecically in Cardf the debate has focused on the statue of Sir Thomas Picton in City Hall.ldquoI am pleased our Council has taken the decision to remove this statue and Irsquom also pleased that this decision was made following a public debate and a democratic vote.ldquoHowever, whilst gestures such as this are important, they cannot deflect us from the harder task of trying to address the challenges still experienced by Black communities today.In , nine years before Picton became the highest-ranking officer killed at the Battle of Waterloo, he was found guilty of torturing a -year-old mixed-race girl during his rule of the Caribbean island.The girl, Louisa Calderon, was tortured in an attempt to get her to confess to stealing from a businessman she lived with as a mistress, and was suspended with rope by one arm above a spike in the floor.He was never sentenced, and two years later the verdict was reversed at a retrial.Earlier in July, First Minister Mark Drakeford ordered an ldquourgent audit of statues, street and building names to address Walesrsquos connections with the slave trade, which will be headed by the countryrsquos first black female councillor, Gaynor Legall.copy -.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

They will consider the level of compliance by August  and could then decide on steps around enforcement.But there was confusion as the Health Minister was forced to backtrack on a statement that claimed a decision on compulsory coverings had already been taken.In other developments on Thursday:The Executive agreed on an indicative date of August  for the reopening of #wet pubs#.Spectators will be allowed to attend outdoor sporting venues where the operator can control access and ensure adherence to social distancing.The number of people from dferent households permitted to gather in a private home is now .Facilities such as bowling alleys and swimming pools can open from FridayHealth officials revealed a coronavirus contact tracing app for Northern Ireland will be launched next week.And ministers have updated advice for people heading abroad.Guidance which had said only to travel overseasit is essential has been dropped. Instead people are urged to carefully consider your holiday and travel options, in light of the continuing Covid- threat.The issue sparked a row after Alliance health spokeswoman Paula Bradshaw said her family would travel to Italy for a holiday this weekend. Hours after defending her plans, the South Belfast MLA cancelled the trip.On Thursday night she refused to be drawn on whether she would reconsider, saying it was a private matter.After days of confusion around holidays, Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill are seeking a special summit including the British and Irish Governments to address discord over Covid- travel restrictions. Deputy First Minister Ms O#Neill admitted: The position is confusing for people, it is a mess across the island.The Executive on Thursday night faced fresh claims of mixed messaging - this time on face coverings.At .pm a statement was released from Mr Swann welcoming the Executive#s decision to make the wearing of face coverings mandatory in shops. It said the rule would take effect on a phased basis from August , with a lead-in periodwill see legal enforcement of the measure beginning on August .But  minutes later a second statement was issued, removing any reference to mandatory rules.Mr Swann, in his new statement, said the initial emphasis will be on education and encouragement.There had been calls for the Executive to make face masks here compulsory, after similar moves by England, Scotland and the Republic.But retail bodies said they feared making coverings mandatory would deter shoppers.On Thursday the Executive agreed to give itself the power to make face coverings mandatory in some indoor settings including shops. But the law will not be enforced until August  - and only thentake-up of masks is low. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, and Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, had said they were opposed to face coverings becoming mandatory. In a joint statement they welcomed the Executive#s decision, adding: We appreciate that ministers have listened to concerns expressed from both of our organisations and have decided to adopt an initial voluntary approach to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops. The decision will allow retailers time to prepare properly and also let the Executive develop guidance, better inform everyone of the benefits of wearing face coverings and educate us all on how to use coverings correctly.Meanwhile, Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, welcomed news of an indicative opening date of August  for wet pubs. He said: These pubs are at the heart of our local communities and have experienced signicant financial dficulties since closure in March.It has also been confirmed a Covid- tracing app will be launched next week. Department of Health chief digital information officer Dan West told the Stormont health committee it would be called Stop Covid NI. Use of the app will be voluntary and it will not collect identiable information, he added. Should someone receive a positive test they will receive a unique code texted to their phone. Once the user gives permissions it will release data from the phone to a server so close contacts can be traced, he added.Northern Ireland will be the first part of the UK to have a contact tracing app. The Republic#s app launched earlier this month.Meanwhile, eight new cases of Covid- have been recorded here, the Department of Health confirmed. No further deaths were recorded in the past  hours and the death toll from the virus remains at , based on the department#s figures, which cover mainly hospital fatalities.

That should not distract from the responsibility on all of us to cover up every time we go to the shops, he said. “I remain unconvinced that the necessary level of compliance will be achieved without some element of enforcement. That said, I would be delighted to be proved wrong on that front. The onus is on everyone on all of the sides of the debate to work together to achieve our shared objective.“I welcome the fact that the Executive has agreed to introduce the power to enforce a mandatory position from August .

Yesterday it repeated its position that it would not ulge specic details about cluster outbreaks. There have been  clusters here since the end of May.Sean McKeever, from Unite, which is not the Ballymena#s site recognised trade union but does have members there, said the PHA should implement testing of Moy Park employees for a -day period. We cover the rest of the Moy Park sites and my concern would be the health and safety of all workers on that site, he told the Belfast .I think that every worker should be tested on site over the next  days to make sure it is eradicated.Moy Park has said that it is facilitating testing employees and their households at local test centres.Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw, a member of health committee, said it highlighted the need for greater preventative measures for the food manufacturing sector, adding Stormont must show more forthright action.We have seen instances where in the UK and Ireland of tens of cases being linked to inidual meat factories, and literally thousands of confirmed cases were linked to a single plant in Gutersloh in Germany, she said.It is completely obvious that meat factories represent a serious risk.This outbreak suggests that not enough has been done by the relevant ministers to ensure staff safely in meat factories.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swimming pools to reopen on Friday as Executive given power to enforce wearing of face masksAlf McCreary: Why I feel like a stranger in my own city after first trip to BelfastI#m an MP for everyone, insists Finucane after hostile reception in loyalist areaBelfast City Airport secures six new routes to Great BritainCoronavirus quarantine: Your questions answered on confusing Northern Ireland travel regulations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Now, he#s on his way back.Much to the disappointment of his legion of fans across the ide, it won#t be toto office in Stormont House. Rather, Smith will drive next week from his North Yorkshire constituency to Scotland, where he will board a ferry for a week#s holiday on our shores. Not since Mo Mowlam has a Secretary of State actually fallen for this place. I genuinely love Northern Ireland and I#m looking forward to reacquainting myself with its people, restaurants and bars, he says  enjoying a few Ulster fries and tray bakes. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith during his first visit to Northern Ireland outside the Guildhall in Londonderry FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith during his first visit to Northern Ireland outside the Guildhall in LondonderryI#d have been back far soonerit wasn#t for Covid.Smith traces his affinity for this neck of the woods to growing up in Fintry, a fantastically beautul Scottish village with a big and strong sense of community.Appointing him Secretary of State is widely regarded as the best thing Boris Johnson has ever done for Northern Ireland, and removing him the worst.Smith didn#t have a hard act to follow in the hapless Karen Bradley. It#s not just that he brokered a deal in January to restore devolution at Stormont after three years of deadlock. His whole style of doing business was dferent to his predecessors of the previous two decades.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith with PM Boris Johnson, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster on the steps of Stormont earlier this year FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith with PM Boris Johnson, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster on the steps of Stormont earlier this yearImmediately after his appointment on July  last year, he hired two twenty-something special advisers, Ross Easton and Lilah Howson-Smith.On our first trip to Northern Ireland, Lilah mentioned how excited her mum was that we were going to a place where someone as passionate as Mo Mowlam had worked, Smith tells me. That got me thinking about the approach I wanted to take. Mo had been extremely hands-on, very direct and personable. She had focused on building relationships. I felt that the Secretary of State position could be quite activist and maybe a bit less formal than it had sometimes been.Smith first visited Northern Ireland is his childhood, when he was a junior international squash player.He came to the job knowing the DUP inside out from his two years as Theresa May#s chief whip in the House of Commons. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith with DUP leader Arlene Foster and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Enniskillen for the Remembrance Sunday service in November last year FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith with DUP leader Arlene Foster and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Enniskillen for the Remembrance Sunday service in November last yearAddressing its party conference in , he had heaped praised on its MPs and said his door was always open to them. Those remarks wrongly led to him being labelled a DUP stooge.He had never met a Sinn Fein politician before becoming Secretary of State, he admits. A committed unionist, he was still determined not to be an archetypal sort of Tory just understanding one perspective. I wanted to work hard to understand them all, he says. Smith set out to build constructive relationships with nationalists. He first met Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney at a very formal event in Hillsborough Castle, where they were surrounded by their officials. As business concluded, he asked Coveney: Will we go to the pub  They sauntered down to the Hillside in the village. From that ice-breaking moment, they built a strong relationship, which paved the way for New Decade, New Approach.Smith thinks politicians perhaps don#t spend enough time having a meal, having a drink, staying that extra night to get to know the people they#re dealing with. It helpsyou#ve broken bread together, he says. It doesn#t mean that there#s full agreement on political issues, but it allows room to tease out the common ground.He put in more time in Northern Ireland than any of his predecessors. Instead of heading back to his constituency, his we and seven-year-old daughter would join him here at weekends. There were trips to the Clip #n Climb and We Are Vertigo adventure centres, and visits to local restaurants and pubs.Did he ever worry about the dissident republican threat during these trips  No, not at all, he says. There are more security issues in Northern Ireland than in any other part of the UK, but I felt completely safe with PSNI support.Uniquely for a Secretary of State, he#d tweet pictures of his leisure activities, aiming to break out of the Stormont bubble and make a connection with ordinary citizens.After the relentless, behind-the-scenes Brexit years, he says that he enjoyed the opportunity to be in a front-facing role as a Secretary of State able to drive policy.Smith lost every key Brexit vote in the Commons, but in Northern Ireland, his skills and strategising reaped signicant rewards. By publishing the text of New Decade, New Approach on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, he and Coveney effectively bounced local politicians into signing up.There were no shocks in the document, he insists, saying that much of the text had been discussed for at least a year,not longer by the DUP and Sinn Fein.Days before the deal was due to be published, he vented his frustration at the lack of progress. We#ve been effing about at this far too long, he told the politicians in front of him.Six months after the restoration of power-sharing, the gloss has well and truly worn off the Stormont executive. The fall-out from Bobby Storey#s funeral means that Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill have stopped holding joint press conferences.Smith, however, remains determinedly optimistic. Everybody needs a bit of a break over the summer, he says. Clearly, there have been some signicant ups and downs, but I hope there#ll be an opportunity to refresh and move forward in the autumn. There is no alternative to power-sharing.He stresses that it#s essential that the Executive urgently focuses on drawing up a programme for government and ensuring that the pledges made in New Decade, New Approach are delivered.He says that he found Foster and O#Neill easy to deal with and both had a good way with people. Ulster Unionist MLA Robin Swann is a very under-stated politician who is really proving himself as Health Minister, he adds. Alliance leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long, meanwhile, is extremely focused, and SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is massively dedicated.Of all Stormont#s politicians, he also singles out as noteworthy SDLP MLA Matthew O#Toole and two special advisers in The Executive Office - the DUP#s Emma Little-Pengelly and Sinn Fein#s Stephen McGlade.He thinks it important that the next generation of MLAs get to know the key players in London and Dublin and build a network of relationships with those who could help them in future.Last year, MPs at Westminster voted to legalise same sex-marriage and abortion in Northern Ireland in the absence of devolution. The DUP expressed its anger at the move, but Smith thinks it was the right thing for Parliament to do. It means Northern Ireland is in a better position regarding social reform, he says. There is no longer any signicant opposition to equal marriage here, he adds. He sees abortion as more controversial, but believes it#s appropriate that rights in Northern Ireland are in line withLondon and Dublin.Smith is most proud of his role in fast-tracking legislation to compensate victims of historical institutional child abuse. The impact of his first encounter with them on becoming Secretary of State was powerful.I met this group of people, some getting on in years, who were extremely frustrated.people who had the most horrendous experiences and had been sent from pillar to post, he says.The impact these crimes had on their lives was stark, compelling and upsetting. I felt very strongly that they#d waited too long. It was an incredible privilege for me to able to help them. It was without doubt the most important thing that I#ve ever done.I found it extremely emotional and a huge honour to be part of their journey.Victim Margaret McGuckin was impressed: My experience means a lack of trust for the authorities is inbred. We were let down by so many other officials and Secretaries of State. Within minutes of meeting Julian Smith, I knew he was a good one. You always feel these government people are looking down on you. With him, it felt we were on the same level, or even that he looked up to us a bit.A passionate Remainer, Smith was axed by the Prime Minister just a month after New Decade, New Approach. His sacking was linked to a Brexit-related tweet four months earlier which was interpreted as a put-down of Dominic Cummings. He maintains that he is not bitter. There has been some speculation that, in a post-Cummings era, Downing Street could come calling with the offer of another Cabinet position. The right to hire and fire lies with the Prime Minister, Smith says. Boris Johnson has my full support at one of most dficult items in recent history. I am enjoying le as a backbench MP. I hope to remain actively involved in future in supporting Northern Ireland, its people, businesses and charities, without, of course, stepping on the toes of my successor, Brandon Lewis, or the devolved administration at Stormont.Smith#s TV producer we Amanda Wilson helped develop Strictly Come Dancing. Could an appearance on the BBC#s flagship Saturday night show loom  Absolutely not, he laughs. I#m so bad at dancing, it#s embarrassing. I#ve been strongly encouraged to take lessons even to pass myself on the floor.They would have to be extremely desperate to contact me. That#s one phone call I#m very unlikely to receive.

It may not be an immediate prospect but it can be argued that every rational reason for the partition of a century ago has either been eroded, or has disappeared entirely,” Mr Salmond said.The Times newspaper report the programme follows a warning from the UK parliament intelligence security committee this week, accusing Russia of using state-owned broadcasters like RT to spread disinformation, including efforts to “interfere with the UK democratic process”.During the debate Mr Ahern said the current Taoiseach, Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin, was right to be cautious about demands for an immediate border poll in order to align Northern Ireland with EU regulations.“The harsh reality is, even though the border has been a big issue on the island since , the amount of work, preparedness and analysis on how you would eliminate it and have one island economy is very little — it wouldn’t even fill one folder,” he said.“There is a huge amount of preparedness, legislative examination, legal examination, how you would integrate the police forces, the legal systems, all of these things would have to be worked through before you could go to the people.“That work has never been done. We’ve been talking at each other for years. If somebody wants to rush it for political reasons, you will get a political answer and the people will reject it.”He added: “My view is not that we should never do it, of course I’m a Republican and it is the number one aim of Fianna Fail . . . but it has to be done properly, properly organised, properly negotiated, trying to convince people, and any other way will only lead to hardship and failure.”SNP defence spokesperson, Stewart McDonald, said his former party leader’s involvement with RT was unhelpful and that Mr Salmond had become Russia’s “useful idiot”. “Certainly his Russian overlords will be delighted that he is actively proposing the disruption of the United Kingdom in this way,” he said.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swimming pools to reopen on Friday as Executive given power to enforce wearing of face masksAlf McCreary: Why I feel like a stranger in my own city after first trip to BelfastI#m an MP for everyone, insists Finucane after hostile reception in loyalist areaBelfast City Airport secures six new routes to Great BritainCoronavirus quarantine: Your questions answered on confusing Northern Ireland travel regulations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is expected to report in August . However, to help with cash-flow issues during the Covid- crisis, the Department has already made a substantial interim payment to NMRN.”“The Agreement that the Department had with NMRN to operate the attraction expired on th June.“The NMRN took the decision not to renew this agreement without a revised funding model being put in place and they notied the Department of this on th June.“This did not leave sufficient time for the department to formulate a new funding model, redraft a new operating agreement or to procure a new operator of the attraction.”DfE says it has agreed with NMRN to extend the closure of HMS Caroline until December  and will fully and thoroughly examine all options and costs for its future.It will also meet agreed costs associated with the temporary closure period including the salaries of two staff members who will be maintaining and overseeing the ship during this time.Belfast has been home to the iconic HMS Caroline, a finalist of the  Art Fund Museum of the Year, since .Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcf-ac-aa-bae-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcf-ac-aa-bae-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcf-ac-aa-bae-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcf-ac-aa-bae-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcf-ac-aa-bae-_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandBattle of Jutland warship’s four years since restoration marked in lockdownA Battle of Jutland warship is set to mark fourth anniversary of its refurbishment in lockdown.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swimming pools to reopen on Friday as Executive given power to enforce wearing of face masksAlf McCreary: Why I feel like a stranger in my own city after first trip to BelfastI#m an MP for everyone, insists Finucane after hostile reception in loyalist areaBelfast City Airport secures six new routes to Great BritainCoronavirus quarantine: Your questions answered on confusing Northern Ireland travel regulations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, he added: “Not only are we not associating ourselves with the cause of which it is alleged Mr Campbell pursued, we are against the strategy of so-called armed struggle altogether.”In a similar vein, Aontu councillor Dr Anne McCloskey and independent councillors Sean Carr and Paul Gallagher all said they would support the motion — but stated their opposition to the violence carried out in Omagh on the day of the atrocity.The DUP’s Graham Warke had tried to get his fellow councillors to agree to let Mr Gallagher address them ahead of the debate, but this was opposed.However, during the debate Mr Warke read out a statement on behalf of the Omagh families expressing their desire for Derry City and Strabane District Council to support a cross-border public inquiry into the circumstances of the Omagh bomb.Derry and Strabane was the second council to debate Campbell’s extradition, coming weeks after controversy in Fermanagh and Omagh, where a majority voted in support of Campbell.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood later apologised to the victims’ families and said when the matter came before the full council meeting held last night all of the party’s councillors would withdraw their support.Mr Gallagher said: “I was totally shocked that Fermanagh and Omagh District Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council put forward motions that aligned them with a man held liable for his part in the Omagh bomb.“This was the worst atrocity in the Troubles killing  people and maiming and injuring over  others.“It was shocking that the two council areas who raised this were the two councils in the north west.”Mr Gallagher added: “But I am so, so pleased and relieved the councillors in Derry and Strabane sent out the strong message that they will not support a man who is not even in this jurisdiction, he is not in either of these council areas.”Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swimming pools to reopen on Friday as Executive given power to enforce wearing of face masksAlf McCreary: Why I feel like a stranger in my own city after first trip to BelfastI#m an MP for everyone, insists Finucane after hostile reception in loyalist areaBelfast City Airport secures six new routes to Great BritainCoronavirus quarantine: Your questions answered on confusing Northern Ireland travel regulations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Liam Campbell, from Dundalk, is wanted in Lithuania over allegations he was part of an operation to buy guns and bombs for the Real IRA.Last month, Dublin’s High Court ordered Campbell’s extradition to the Baltic state.Campbell was found liable in a civil court for the Omagh bomb in August , which claimed the lives of  people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and injured  others.Read More Michael Gallagher expresses relief after Derry council rejects Omagh bomb motion At a meeting of the council’s policy and resources committee earlier this month, independent councillor Bernice Swt sought support in opposing Campbell’s extradition to Lithuania, citing human rights concerns.The committee voted to oppose the extradition with the support of SDLP, Sinn Fein and others while DUP and Ulster Unionist councillors voted against.Members also agreed to write to Taoiseach Micheal Martin to voice the council’s opposition.The move provoked strong criticism, particularly of the SDLP. Leader Colum Eastwood MP later said his party members had been wrong to back the motion and would reverse the decision when it came before the full council for ratication last night.He also offered to meet with the Omagh families to express “profound regret”. The move had left victims of the atrocity “appalled and retraumatised”.Last night at the reconvened council meeting, members voted to stop the council’s support for Campbell by  votes to six with one abstention.While the SDLP changed its position to vote against the motion, four Sinn Fein members continued to support Campbell.The UUP had tabled a counter motion expressing solidarity with the victims of the bomb by writing to Mr Martin and urging him to “speedily resolve” Campbell’s extradition process.Proposing the motion, UUP councillor Victor Warrington said he hoped the council could now “consign this sorry episode in local government to the dustbin of history where it so rightfully belongs”. “This council should defend the innocent men, women, children and unborn who were cut down as they went about their daily lives and not the rights of an inidual whose only link to this district is that he was civilly liable for blowing signicant parts of it to hell and back, killing and maiming citizens and then fleeing, leaving devastation and broken families in his wake,” Mr Warrington said. DUP councillor Errol Thompson added: “Over the last couple of weeks our council has been brought into the gutter and that’s the view of many of our constituents.”Ms Swt accused Mr Warrington of “showing complete scant regard” for the Omagh bomb victims and said his motion fell “very short” in terms of support and solidarity. Sinn Fein tabled an amendment highlighting its concerns about the human rights of Campbell and its resolve to see those responsible for the bombing being held accountable, but this was one of four amendments ruled inadmissible. Last week DUP members of the council lodged a complaint to the Local Government Commissioner for Standards against councillor Swt and Sinn Fein’s council chairman Stephen McCann. They argued that the proposal raised by Ms Swt was not within the council’s remit and should not have been accepted by Mr McCann as reasonable business for the council to conduct. Claire Monteith, whose -year-old brother Alan Radford was killed in the blast, has also reported the two councillors to the local government ombudsman.

On one side were the two internationally recognised bodies north and south of the border, and on the other was the National Cycling Association- a group that wanted an all-Ireland organisation.The RTE Radio  documentary - entitled Green and Gold - speaks to some of the riders on both sides of the ide, as well as Lady Mary Peters, who won a gold medal for Great Britain in Munich before receiving a death threat, and Noel#s grandson Matthew, now an Irish international cyclist himself.The drama of the  cycling road race was played out against the backdrop of the Troubles and the Munich massacre, where Israeli Olympians were taken hostage and killed by Palestinian terrorist group Black September. Both the Troubles and the Munich massacre feature heavily in the  minute documentary.Lady Mary said  had been the worst year of the Troubles, with  people killed in terrorist attacks.I didn#t have a track to train on because the university track was full of potholes, she recalled in the documentary. It wasn#t easy. I didn#t have a car. I used to get two buses. One into the city centre and one out to the training track. I just did it, even though bombs were sometimes going off as you were travelling on the bus and I would be carrying my four kilo shot and my starting blocks. You just did it and I wanted to win so much.With audio from interviews carried out at the time - as well as a brief recording of sports commentator Jackie Fullerton - the documentary is sure to appeal not just to cycling enthusiasts but all Olympic fans.Since  the NCA had been barred from international competition and the group had protested at the  World Championships and the  Olympics. But in  they took the bold step of secretly joining the race itself.NCA cyclist John Mangan actually led the race for a period but was involved in a scuffle with the late Noel Teggart during the event. Kerry man John claimed that Noel had said: There#s a lot of southern b******s around this morning - but that was flatly rejected by Noel#s teammate Kieron McQuaid.As we came near the top of the hill on the next lap, I saw Teggart being pushed from behind into the crowd, Kieron recalled in the documentary.All of a sudden I passed the two of them and my first thought was, #Do I stop and go back and help him #Noel Teggart was a truck driver and I was only a -year-old student, he was well able to handle himself. I thought there was no point in going back because he was well able to handle himself so I just kept going.I didn#t see him again until after we finished and needless to say he was not in good shape, he was disconsolate and he was heartbroken.Following the controversy at Munich, Irish cycling transformed into an all-Ireland power-sharing body - something championed by Noel after he and John made their peace.An RTE interview carried out just after the Olympic road race with an unnamed spokesperson from the NCA team, who was from Northern Ireland, revealed why they protested.We were protesting against Britain#s interference in Irish affairs to the extent that the NCA is not internationally recognised, the man said.Producers David Coughlan and Donal O#Herlihy interviewed Noel#s grandson Matthew , as well as his father Neil Teggart as part of the documentary.It was really [my grandfather] who was the turning point in the whole ide north and south because of what happened to him at the Olympics so now anyone cycling in Ireland, north or south, you ride for Ireland, Matthew said.Green and Gold will air on RTE Radio  tomorrow at pm.

It wasn#t my area, the MP told Radio Ulster. It was unfortunate that that happened. It#s language that may not be surprising, but it#s disappointing. I don#t really care where people come from.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old Irish International Driver of the Year and former Irish Young Driver of the Year touched down on Italian soil on Sunday for the next stage of his rally career. Devine took part in the Junior World Rally Championship in  and last season finished third in a stage of the European Championship in Hungary in the same Hyundai i R car he will be behind the wheel of this weekend. After Tuesdays testing day, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy, spent Wednesday and Thursday carrying out recce of the course and making notes ahead of Fridays shake-down. googletag.cmd.push The event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event which spans just under km. “A lot of effort has been put in by Motorsport Ireland and the Rally Academy to making sure I was here,” Devine told the County Derry Post. “There is the support of Hyundai for me to make a championship assault, so there there is a lot of support being put into it. “It is a big step and I would say it is the biggest year for us. It is going to be our first year and we will be on the back foot. A lot of the drivers we are competing against are in their second or third season and have done this rally a few times.” googletag.cmd.push While Devine sees it as a learning year he realises the need to perform and has set his target to in the Junior R category. “The way it has always worked out in years before,you are fast enough in the juniors you are never that far away from the overall podium. “Chris Ingram, last year, was planning on winning the junior championship and he got beat on it by . of a second in the Czech Republic, he lost the junior championship but he went on to win the full European Championship.” Devine speaks of how the European Championship has lost a lot of momentum to the World Championship, but with Covid- forcing the cancellation of other events it will bring all the big hitters to Italy this weekend. “Craigand a lot of the guys who have been here before, there are lot of quick guys that are going to be going for the main championship. It was probably the strongest year in the European Championship for the last five or six years. There are a lot of quick drivers, but thats what you want,” Devine said. During his World Rally debut in , the Park man had two fourth places and a fth place finish. “We were second in Portugal and we had a DNF . In Corsica, we clipped a back wheel and went down, we were heading for the podium there,” he recalls. “It was one of those years, it didnt click for us. It was a big step, you learn a lot from it. At the time, there wasnt much support and you were left jumping into the unknown into the WRC and how much is involved in it outside of driving of the car, that was the biggest shock but at the same time we enjoyed it. “It was a challenging year and we are now back on the Europeanand are where we want to be.We want to race abroad and see how fast we can be.” Being named International Driver of the Year last season was a big shock for Devine, given the field of drivers in the hunt for the title. Apart from a gravel rally in Fivemiletown earlier this year, the sporting lockdown forced Callum into a dferent type of training. “I have been keeping fit, I got a bike,” he jokes. “I did a bit of running, I was in the forest and bought the bike and doing prep watching on-boards from the rallies and keeping myself fit and active.” He pays tribute to Motorsport Ireland and in particular John Coyne for getting another chance to dine at the top table. “He lives over in the Statesbut he is a great of Irish rallying. They have gave me a lot of help andit wasnt for them, I wouldnt be here.” For Devine, in his usual laid back conservation, its time to steer his way towards a podium spot.

The -year-old Irish International Driver of the Year and former Irish Young Driver of the Year touched down on Italian soil on Sunday for the next stage of his rally career. Devine took part in the Junior World Rally Championship in  and last season finished third in a stage of the European Championship in Hungary in the same Hyundai i R car he will be behind the wheel of this weekend. After Tuesdays testing day, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy, spent Wednesday and Thursday carrying out recce of the course and making notes ahead of Fridays shake-down. googletag.cmd.push The event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event which spans just under km. “A lot of effort has been put in by Motorsport Ireland and the Rally Academy to making sure I was here,” Devine told the County Derry Post. “There is the support of Hyundai for me to make a championship assault, so there there is a lot of support being put into it. “It is a big step and I would say it is the biggest year for us. It is going to be our first year and we will be on the back foot. A lot of the drivers we are competing against are in their second or third season and have done this rally a few times.” googletag.cmd.push While Devine sees it as a learning year he realises the need to perform and has set his target to in the Junior R category. “The way it has always worked out in years before,you are fast enough in the juniors you are never that far away from the overall podium. “Chris Ingram, last year, was planning on winning the junior championship and he got beat on it by . of a second in the Czech Republic, he lost the junior championship but he went on to win the full European Championship.” Devine speaks of how the European Championship has lost a lot of momentum to the World Championship, but with Covid- forcing the cancellation of other events it will bring all the big hitters to Italy this weekend. “Craigand a lot of the guys who have been here before, there are lot of quick guys that are going to be going for the main championship. It was probably the strongest year in the European Championship for the last five or six years. There are a lot of quick drivers, but thats what you want,” Devine said. During his World Rally debut in , the Park man had two fourth places and a fth place finish. “We were second in Portugal and we had a DNF . In Corsica, we clipped a back wheel and went down, we were heading for the podium there,” he recalls. “It was one of those years, it didnt click for us. It was a big step, you learn a lot from it. At the time, there wasnt much support and you were left jumping into the unknown into the WRC and how much is involved in it outside of driving of the car, that was the biggest shock but at the same time we enjoyed it. “It was a challenging year and we are now back on the Europeanand are where we want to be.We want to race abroad and see how fast we can be.” Being named International Driver of the Year last season was a big shock for Devine, given the field of drivers in the hunt for the title. Apart from a gravel rally in Fivemiletown earlier this year, the sporting lockdown forced Callum into a dferent type of training. “I have been keeping fit, I got a bike,” he jokes. “I did a bit of running, I was in the forest and bought the bike and doing prep watching on-boards from the rallies and keeping myself fit and active.” He pays tribute to Motorsport Ireland and in particular John Coyne for getting another chance to dine at the top table. “He lives over in the Statesbut he is a great of Irish rallying. They have gave me a lot of help andit wasnt for them, I wouldnt be here.” For Devine, in his usual laid back conservation, its time to steer his way towards a podium spot.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The first threat came in the rise of out of town shopping centres. I can remember the campaigns fought against them in Derry by local city centre retailers who argued it would suck the le out of the city centre. This battle to stop planning being granted for out of town centres was largely lost and we only have to look at Crescent Link to see the impact its had on retail footfall in the city centre. Then we had the advent of online retail which began nibbling at retail sales about  years ago. googletag.cmd.push This nibble has now become a feast. Prior to Covid-, online retail was certainly taking a big chunk out of disposable income. For anyone under  purchasing online from eBay Amazon and using PayPal was as normal as going up the town. Buying clothes, electronics, games etc on your phone for younger people was the norm rather than the exception. With Covid-, however, online retail has reached into every age group. With shops closed and fear of infection particularly amongst older people the rush online has been music to the ears of companies like Amazon. For Derry city, the problem is amplied. googletag.cmd.push Derry suffers from having an already dficult retail situation. We have the highest level of welfare dependency in the North and still rank the highest in any UK deprivation statistics. We also have the highest level of unemployment in the  council areas. This in turn means less disposable income for the local population so retailers have to compete for a smaller amount of money available. Our city centre is beautul but it really needs huge investment made. Carlisle Roadhas a few vacant sites and a number of vacant shops and really could benefit from some redevelopment.  There is a plethora of charity and pound shops which provide valuable employment and services to the most vulnerable but they also tell a story about our city and its spending power.  And when you see a landmark building like the Austin’s Building boarded up and the old Poundstretchers site on Bishop Street still not developed, it really doesnt bode well. And lets not even talk about the view from the Peace Bridge into Foyle Street which shows buildings with weeds growing out the windows. I could go on, but the city centre has been on a slow decline for the last  years and the financial crisis of  has really accelerated it. If there is not urgent action taken now and led by Derry and Strabane District Council, we might not have a city centre in . So how do we reimagine our city centre   Well one thing for sure is the recent announcement by DCSDC that a shortfall in their budget might have to be met with a -year double digits rates increase is not the answer. Such a move, in my opinion, would completely kill business owners operating in the city centre. And remember having a vibrant city centre is what drives tourism. It also drives student numbers. Students and tourists will only come to Derry is it is vibrant and safe. If we allow it to die then we kill tourism. We have to be very careful of what we do in the next  years. So, what could a post Covid- Derry city centre look like  For starters, I think we definitely need more outside space offered to shops and retailers. The whole vibe seems to be al fresco which is driven mainly by the belief that its harder to catch the virus outside. It also helps solve the capacity issue for many pubs restaurants etc. Of course, in continental Europe it rains a lot less but in Holland it rains  days a year and they have a lot more outside space use than us. Ive been to Liverpoola few times and they have as much rain as us but definitely more outside space.  I just hope council dont charge rates for this space. If we want people back to work and businesses generating profits to afford rates, we shouldnt overload their rates bills. I would also seriously look at taking traffic out of the city centre and creating a huge pedestrian zone from the top of Bishop Street straight down to the River Foyle. I would also pedestrianize from the bottom of Carlisle Road right up and including the whole of the Walled City.I would allow a bike lane. Post Covid-, people will want physical distance and what better way to do it than take traffic out all together from the city centre. Data from Living Streets suggests where the pedestrian experience has been improved, footfall has increased between  and %. Bear in mind there has been a % decline in footfall on the high street across the UK between  and . In Leicester for example, shop vacancy rates were five times higher on streets with higher levels of traffic and turnover in pedestrianised areas generally outperforms non pedestrian areas . Bear in mind that a report done by Sustrans titled ‘Bike Le ’ found that % of residents living in  UK citieswere keen to see more space made available on their high streets for people socialising cycling and walking. This was before Covid- and I would guess the % in now higher. Council government really need to look at the whole business rates issue and attempt to rebalance it. Some work is already being done on this and I know the Minister for Finance Connor Murphy is looking to launch something soon. Derry, however, should look at a scheme to encourage new businesses to take up space which includes a rates free period. We need to encourage new businesses to locate into the city centre. Ebrington is another exciting addition to the solution. We can expand the city centre across into Ebrington where there is plenty of outside space. We should also utilise the Guildhall Square on a permanent basis and its a perfect link to Ebrington. We really need to imagine a new city centre with many uses. We need to also develop more markets across the city. Markets bring football and offer small producers a change to sell their products. Covid offers many opportunities as well as challenges. During lockdown we saw a huge increase in the number of people working from home and living locally. Its likely that there will be less commuting to larger towns and cities so people will be spending more time in their immediate local area. Its up to us now to design a new city centre which meets the needs of people. The new high street city centre cant only be about retail. To think this way would be to ignore the clear trends in consumer behaviour and online retail. Sustans, an organisation which has researched this widely, said in a recent report: Re-establishing the role of the high streets as a hub for social connection and reinforcing and celebrating its roots and unique character could go a long way to encourage people to stay local and spend their money where they live. I would go further than that and suggest it could also attract the visitors and students Derry needs to become the vibrant city it aspires too. We need to reimagine our city centre. We have to repurpose large buildings for new uses and also consider housing provision as well. Public spaces like the Guildhall Squareneed remodelling to make more room for meeting, eating and retail.  All of this might mean changing rules in relation to the use of public space and licensing arrangements but we really have to change before our city centre dies. In summary, the current city centre isnt thriving and hasnt for  years. Consumer behaviour, out-of-town retail, online shopping and now Covid- have each had an impact. Its now time to tear the rule book up and imagine the city centre we want for the next  years and the reality is that it will be less about retail and more about making them somewhere where people want to be. It needs to be accessible fun and an exciting development. Lets hope our council appoint the right experts and design team who can hopefully create and enhance our city centre for social and civic use.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael McMullan caught up with winning captain Pat McGuckin and trainer Dessie Ryan. *** The years change, success comes in cycles, but the bloodlines stay the same. Connor Nevin was the last Ballinderry captain to hoist the Seamus McFerran Cup after their  win over Glenswilly, following in his father Aidans footsteps from their first Ulster win. Before that, Adrian McGuckin was their Ulster winning captain in their All-Ireland winning season of  ,  years after his father, Adrian senior, picked up an Ulster medal. googletag.cmd.push Both successes came after the Shamrocks unleashed an underage production line that churned out an endless supply of county players, college stars and underage titles. It transformed them into a force at senior level, but it all had to start somewhere. After retaining the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in , the fourth of  titles, Ballinderry tasted Ulster success for the first time in April of the following year due to a delay in the Ulster campaign.

We went on a tour of the parish, down all the wee roads and there was a cavalcade of cars coming behind us blaring the horns, it was just brilliant.” Within  years, there was another invasion across the Ballinderry Bridge. Their All-Ireland heroes, clad in matching suits to mark the occasion of their first appearance in an All-Ireland final, paraded behind pipers Michael Conway and the Bell brothers. It was the final leg on the journey from Thurles, where the final was played due to renovations at Croke Park. “Its a long way to Tipperary,” they sang in the fading light, as they followed the hazard lights of their late sponsor Colm Scullions Mercedes Benz up Church Hill. “That was just something ,” Pat beams with pride. Those who know him, he is Ballinderry to the core. *** Rumour has it that goalkeeper Pat McKee first stepped on a pitch at the age of  when he appeared between the posts. Man mountain Gerry McCusker didnt come to prominence until his late teens. “We didnt have the same underage winning teams like the generations that followed,” Pat McGuckin outlines. “I remember us going to recently cut hay fields, about eight or nine of us, and playing for hours. We all turned into decent senior footballers.” The club was formed in  and were champions the following year, but had to wait  years for the next title. “We got to a semi-final in  and threw away a title to Lavey in ,” McGuckin remembers. With  minutes to go, Paddy Chivers long ball was punched to the net by Joe Boyle, helping Lavey to a - to - win. The tables were turned in , with the Shamrocks coming through against Lavey after a replay with a team captained by Sean McIvor and managed by Mick McGuckin, who would become club Chairman the following year. “We were getting better, stronger and more experienced as the years went on,” Pat said. At the turn of the year, there was a new management team in place. His brother Adrian, who was beginning to make his name on the Ulster Colleges MacRory Cup scene with St Patricks Maghera joined Sean McIvor and another experienced player, Malachy Conway, as a management trio. With all three continuing to play, it looked like a dficult situation would arise during the season. “This problem seemed to be solved when Adrian sustained a nasty neck injury during a Larkin Cup game in March. He decided to retire and concentrate on sideline duties,” Pat points out. As the the weeks and months passed and with the championship approaching, Adrian got the bug for playing and it wasnt long until the boots were back on. It coincided with Dessie Ryansfrom New York, where, after a time in construction, he became one of five Irish born members of the Fire Department. Back on Irish soil, he bought a bar in Ballyronan and Adrian McGuckin floated the idea of coming to train the Shamrocks. It was the last part of the puzzle. “It was one of the best bits of work we ever did,” Pat states. “He played a major role in our success at that time and ever since.” While heralded as one of the games greatest every coaches, admired by some of the of the greatest players from all over Ulster, Ryans modesty is striking. “Sometimes you get the credit for what the players do,” stressed Dessie, while repeatedly pointing to the the importance of having people on the pitch who could think on their feet. *** Ballinderrys first championship obstacle of the  season was Magherafelt, who were champions three years earlier. “They were a great team and the game was really tight and it couldve gone either way,” McGuckin states. With time almost up, the sides were deadlocked and Ballinderry won a free to win the game. Having kicked balls off the deck since the age of , Pat McGuckin was Ballinderrys long-range kicker, something he was decent at. Two or three times a game he would trot forward from defence to kick s. Even in this twilight years, on Ballinderry Thirds junior championship winning team of , he burled a handful of points in their semi-final win over Foreglen. A team that included his brother James and future All-Ireland winners Sean Donnelly, Darren Crozier and Fabian Muldoon in their youth. “Theof the kick gets longer in the telling as the years go on,” Pat jokes about the kick that sunk Magherafelt and put Ballinderry on their way. “But...being the modest man that I am, I can definitely say it was from within my own half.” Lurking in the next round was a Kilrea team under the management of Leo ONeill, who were shooting the lights out during the league and the Shamrocks were weary of them. “We knew we had to be at the top of our game to beat them and we did, to setup a semi-final with Glenullin,” Pat continued. Ballinderry navigated the Glen to book their second successive county final berth against Banagher, who they had beaten in the  decider. Going into the game, Ballinderry had their homework done. Banagher were back-boned by hardy defenders Sean McCloskey, Pat and John McCullagh. “They had the flying Mickey Lynch at midfield, with Fintan McCloskey and their captain Alfie Dallas as their standout forwards,” McGuckin remembers. “But we had our own star players and from the experience of the previous year, we went into the game as favourites.”  James, Terence, Pat, Adrian and Mick McGuckin pictured after the  county final. Pat was captain, Adrian is wearing Alfie Dallas swapped Banagher jersey. Mick was club Chairman, after managing the Shamrocks to the  title The game proved to be a long struggle before Ballinderry emerged winners, - to -. It was another passport back into Ulster, where a familiar face awaited them. *** Once again the draw was far from kind. In , Ballinderry had drawn Monaghan giants Scotstown in the preliminary round at home in Shamrock Park. “They gave us an absolute thrashing, I think they beat us by  points or more,” Pat McGuckin remembers with an accuracy that defeat always delivers. “What was the draw for   Yes, it was another preliminary round with Scotstown, this time in Ballybay. They had  county players on their side and were going for a fourth successive Ulster.” The media didnt give Ballinderry a prayer and as Pat admits, who couldve blame them. “Dessie Ryan was not a man to throw in the towel. He analysed video tapes and instilled a belief in our team that we could beat them,” McGuckin stated. Dessie was at the  clash and did watch footage of the Monaghan side, but it was on the pitch where the transformation happened. The players, in his opinion, had belief tucked inside themselves, below the hurt. “Most of my work was done on the field. I always thought the field was a better blackboard than talking in a classroom. “It was the thought process of the players,” he added. “I dont want to take any credit, they probably knew themselves they were not as bad as the first day and they had things to prove to themselves.” Ballinderry turned in a courageous performance right across the board. A -year-old James McGuckin had a stormer in defence, while skyscrapers Gerry McCusker and Sean McIvor were outstanding at midfield. Terence McGuckin, still only , swung frees over from all angles. “Brian Duffin sank an unstoppable shot to the net, late on, to send us home with the most narrowest of victories. It was a victory greeted with as much celebration as our county final win and one which gave us great confidence to proceed in the competition,” McGuckin summed up. Donegal champions Ardara, with young midfielder Anthony Molloy in their ranks, came to Bellaghy for the quarter-final. Goals from brothers Kieran and Kevin Wilkinson put Ballinderry on their way to a comfortable victory. Next up was was Kingscourt Stars in the semi-final back in Bellaghy. “We loved playing there,” Pat admits. “They had a big name at the time, with many Cavan county players. It was a gripping game, which ended up all square thanks to a late Kingscourt equaliser.” Replays always cause scheduling problems, but with the inclement weather things got worse. “It was actually fixed for the Sunday before Christmas, December th my memory serves me right,” said McGuckin. However, with a weekend of snow and frost, the game was postponed until the following February. It gave Dessie Ryan the chance to ramp up the training and preparations. *** Dessie Ryan, while he strongly plays it down, is a legendary figure around Ballinderry, often called into management teams. In his own quiet way, he leaves a stamp on any team. While a thinker, he puts faith in players and their ability to make decisions. “Sometimes I think players themselves are vastly underrated in terms of thinking and that they are just there to play. A lot of success that I have had has came from the players and their thoughts,” Ryan points out. It was something the Ballinderry players had. “They were natural footballers and you dont want to stle anything like that. Of course there are positions you need to keep covered all the time. They had this rapport among them thatone went up the field another would drop back. “If the centre was open, the wing backs would pull towards the middle. Nobody would notice, but it could be the dference in intercepting a pass.” Ryan, now turned , was a running champion in his s and his training regime in the winter before the Kingscourt replay, according to Pat McGuckin, remains in Ballinderry folklore. “My memories are the muck and the clabber,” McGuckin says of those sessions. “The nights were freezing and I remember some of the puddles even frozen over. “Ill never forget one drill of us sprinting in a line across our old muddy pitch. Every time Dessie blew his whistle, we had to e forward before getting up and sprinting on. It was horrible at the time, but it developed character and spirit in the .” Not one of the players complained, Dessie recalls. They just got on with it. “Games are not often called off because of weather, so when you train in those sort of conditions and when the day comes, you are better prepared and you have covered all the eventualities,” Dessie added. “I felt it was a good mind-building exercise, to go to near breaking point and pulling the plug. You cant help but complement them . Thats what counts, you are in it together.” It stood to Ballinderry on their February visit to Kingscourt, as Ballinderry scraped across the line in a - to - and setup a final meeting with a Burren team that would go on to win two All-Irelands and five Ulster titles in the s. With the county scene in full swing, it was a further eight weeks before their April visit to Lurgans Davitt Park for the Ulster final. Burren had Paddy ORourke and the McGovern brothers in their team. At corner forward they had Frank McClorey, better known as UTVs Frank Mitchell. Excitement was at an all-time high on the banks of the Ballinderry river as the game approached. Pat remembers looking out the windows of the bus as they arrived at the ground, seeing some parishioners who had never even been at a Gaelic match before. It was a low-scoring game, with the teams level - each at half-time and defences were very much on top during the second half. “With  minutes to go, we struck for two quick goals in succession from Kieran Wilkinson and John Joe Rocks,” Pat McGuckin added.  The Ballinderry team celebrate the  Ulster club title, after their win over Burren “I was obviously proud to be the first Ballinderry man to accept the Seamus McFerran Cup. The two other lads who enjoyed the same honour - namely Adrian McGuckin junior in  and he played excellently through that campaign. “Connor Nevin was the captain in  and a son of Aidan who was excellent throughout that  success, playing at centre half-forward.” In the changing rooms after the game and with the announcement of the All-Ireland semi-final being fixed for seven days later, with Mayo side Garrymore, celebrations quickly died down. With the quick turnaround, Ballinderry tried in vain to squeeze an extra week to help preparations for their opponents, who were fresh after spending months preparing after their Connacht win. “The game went ahead, as planned, in Bellaghy which was a help. Jameswas our centre half-back and an important cog in our machine. He broke his finger in the first five minutes and had to be replaced. “It disrupted us and the other bits of luck we were enjoying, then deserted us as well. We lost the game by one solitary point and despite not playing at our best, it was a game we couldve won,” Pat admits. In the weeks that followed, the disappointment subsided and Ballinderry began to bask in the the glory of their Ulster title. The following week, a Mickey Niblock inspired Nemo Rangers beat Garrymore fairly handsomely in the final,” Pat continued. Since hanging up the boots, Pat has remained a regular fixture at Shamrock Park. He is completing an unbroken -year spell as club secretary. This would have doubled from ious other stints in the post. Ive enjoyed them all especially the recent term as modern technology has made communication so much easier and I have plenty of spare time,” he concluded. “Like playing, there comes a time to move aside and let a younger member take the reigns...that time is very very soon,but Ill still be knocking about at somethingGod spares me.” The more things change, the more they stay the same. Its in the blood.

Michael McMullan caught up with winning captain Pat McGuckin and trainer Dessie Ryan. *** The years change, success comes in cycles, but the bloodlines stay the same. Connor Nevin was the last Ballinderry captain to hoist the Seamus McFerran Cup after their  win over Glenswilly, following in his father Aidans footsteps from their first Ulster win. Before that, Adrian McGuckin was their Ulster winning captain in their All-Ireland winning season of  ,  years after his father, Adrian senior, picked up an Ulster medal. googletag.cmd.push Both successes came after the Shamrocks unleashed an underage production line that churned out an endless supply of county players, college stars and underage titles. It transformed them into a force at senior level, but it all had to start somewhere. After retaining the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in , the fourth of  titles, Ballinderry tasted Ulster success for the first time in April of the following year due to a delay in the Ulster campaign. They were captained by Pat McGuckin and his son Kevin, only  months old at the time, would go on to annex two Ulster medals, an All-Ireland and was the clubs winning captain of . googletag.cmd.push  Pat McGuckin receives the Seamus McFerran Cup from Peter Harte of the Ulster Council following their  success “I remember us getting off the bus at Duffs Corner and getting on the back of Paddy Conways lorry,” Pat recalls of the homecoming and an outpouring of joy after defeating Burren to put themselves on the provincial map. “He wouldve taken the lorry out for ious celebrations down the years. We went on a tour of the parish, down all the wee roads and there was a cavalcade of cars coming behind us blaring the horns, it was just brilliant.” Within  years, there was another invasion across the Ballinderry Bridge. Their All-Ireland heroes, clad in matching suits to mark the occasion of their first appearance in an All-Ireland final, paraded behind pipers Michael Conway and the Bell brothers.

The Ballinderry team celebrate the  Ulster club title, after their win over Burren “I was obviously proud to be the first Ballinderry man to accept the Seamus McFerran Cup. The two other lads who enjoyed the same honour - namely Adrian McGuckin junior in  and he played excellently through that campaign. “Connor Nevin was the captain in  and a son of Aidan who was excellent throughout that  success, playing at centre half-forward.” In the changing rooms after the game and with the announcement of the All-Ireland semi-final being fixed for seven days later, with Mayo side Garrymore, celebrations quickly died down. With the quick turnaround, Ballinderry tried in vain to squeeze an extra week to help preparations for their opponents, who were fresh after spending months preparing after their Connacht win. “The game went ahead, as planned, in Bellaghy which was a help. Jameswas our centre half-back and an important cog in our machine. He broke his finger in the first five minutes and had to be replaced. “It disrupted us and the other bits of luck we were enjoying, then deserted us as well. We lost the game by one solitary point and despite not playing at our best, it was a game we couldve won,” Pat admits. In the weeks that followed, the disappointment subsided and Ballinderry began to bask in the the glory of their Ulster title. The following week, a Mickey Niblock inspired Nemo Rangers beat Garrymore fairly handsomely in the final,” Pat continued. Since hanging up the boots, Pat has remained a regular fixture at Shamrock Park. He is completing an unbroken -year spell as club secretary. This would have doubled from ious other stints in the post. Ive enjoyed them all especially the recent term as modern technology has made communication so much easier and I have plenty of spare time,” he concluded. “Like playing, there comes a time to move aside and let a younger member take the reigns...that time is very very soon,but Ill still be knocking about at somethingGod spares me.” The more things change, the more they stay the same. Its in the blood.

Speculation was mounting over the feasibility of the club championships at the weekend, after  clubs suspended their senior activities following positive cases of Covid-. Banagher and Craigbane acted first, on Thursday night, before they were joined by Ardmore, Limavady, Drumsurn, Magilligan, Glack, Foreglen, Claudy and Drum followed suit. Drum have extended their cessation of activities until Monday, July . “This is a matter for the organising committee, in this instance Derry GAA, to manage as they see fit,” said Alan Milton, the GAAs Director of Communications, while also saying it was discussed with counties on a conference call last week. googletag.cmd.push The GAA has ed to games activity on the principle of opt-in added Declan Woods, Ulster GAAs PRO. “Given the uncertainties that exist around Covid-, each county has been asked to draft Competition Rules to deal with potential scenarios.” Derry have indicated that their championships, starting with Saturdays hurling clash of Banagher and Coleraine will go ahead. Games will he played as scheduled,” a Derry board spokesperson told the County Derry Post.

It is understood to be a player and the club moved by insisting all their players get tested. “We resume training on Wednesday night,” outlined senior hurling manager John ODwyer. “Only players who come back with a negative test will be permitted to train or to play in Saturdays game with Coleraine.” The former Derry camogie manager, who won back to back Ulster titles with the countys hurlers, feels the GAA should pull the pin on the season. “For the sake of five games, they should have forgot about it and started again in January. For us in Banagher, we did everything according to plan and it takes a lot of effort to go through with the procedures. “For us, there is just not enough gain. If I wasnt the manager, I would be nowhere near it. Someone at a higher level shouldve made the decision to call off the season.” Grab this weeks County Derry Post for previews of this weekends hurling games. RELATEDThis weeks fixtures.

Last year, the Education Authorityproposed discontinuing Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School because of the low number of pupils at the school. Groarty is the only integrated school on Derrys cityside. The proposal has now been agreed to by the Minister of Education Peter Weir. It had originally been proposed that the school would close at the end of August . However, the closure date has been extended to August . Mr Weir said: Having weighed up all the information, including the fact that  of the  pupils will be exiting P, with no new intake for - or September , it is clear that unfortunately the school is not sustainable, and that provision for any pupils in an integrated setting can be made where in the city. googletag.cmd.push The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained integrated status in . A final decision regarding its closure was expected to be made by the department and Mr Weir at the beginning of this year. However, the decision was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of pupils at the school has fluctuated over time but has not risen above  in the past ten years. Ahead of the   school year - before proposals were announced to close -  pupils enrolled. Following that decision, numerous parents took the decision to transfer their children to other schools which was reflected in enrolment figures of just  for the   school year. googletag.cmd.push The EA proposed closing Groarty Integrated Primary School, situated on the Coshquin Road, at the end of August . Parents were ‘devastated’ when first informed of the plans on April , . Schoolchildren from the school then hand delivered letters to then education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry’s Guildhall imploring him to reconsider. The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. A consultation received  objections from amongst others the Board of Governors, staff, parents, a local resident and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. Points include the fact it is the only integrated primary school in the cityside and considerable distance to the other one, Oakgrove IPS, in the Waterside. The school caters for children with special needs and has a strong shared educational programme with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. The case was also made that housing developments are planned for the area which could improve numbers. However, the EA says that other schools close to Groarty, such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school ‘does not operate within its in-year budget’, the school’s enrolment falls ‘well short’ of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for the club confirmed the news last night after a day of uncertainly regarding the potential fixture. Originally scheduled to face League of Ireland champions Dundalk, Celtic were expecting to welcome the Lilywhites to Celtic Park, but quarantine restrictions ended their hopes of playing the game with anyone coming into the Republic from the UK having to self isolate for  days. With the League of Ireland set to start next Friday, that would have been impossible for the champions. googletag.cmd.push That opened the door for Derry City to step into the glamour friendly, with reports suggesting that former Celtic and City star Paddy McCourt was heavily involved in organising the game. The hope was that, as Derry City would only be travelling to another part of the UK from Northern Ireland, they are not bound by the same restrictions. That hope continued into yesterday, with the club hoping to finalise arrangements for the game, but they were dashed by the FAI last night. With City set to travel to Dublin to face St. Patricks Athletic, just eight days after the proposed game in Scotland, the same -day rule which scuppered Dundalks plans, also appear to have stopped Derry, despite technically being in the UK. googletag.cmd.push Instead of Celtic, City hope to finalise their pre-season plans with a game against Northwest neighbours Finn Harps behind closed doors at the Brandywell tomorrow night. Declan Devines men faced Cltonville in midweek and drew -, with the City boss running his eye over three new trialists. The Candystyripes face Sligo Rovers in the resumption of the league season next Friday. Celtic, meanwhile, who now wont have Irish opposition this weekend, finished off their mini tour of France with a - defeat at French giants Paris St-German, with superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both on the scoresheet in the Parc des Princes encounter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along. Recently, it seems to be turning out to more of a community effort to be honest, he said.ldquoAt the beginning of lockdown I missed all my friends, but the farm helped keep me busy.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be a great lover of completing schoolwork at home. I much prefer spending my time tending to my fruit and vegetables and caring for my new chicks.ldquoSometime my little sister, Grace, helps me. She is nine years old and is learning a lot more about farming than I ever thought she would.Aarin added: ldquoI thought the good weather during lockdown helped my vegetables grow.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

It seems no time since she was working to break the -minute barrier so real progress has been made by both these runners.In the K there was an ldquoelite race which was the focus for many top athletes as they tested their legs on the flat course and against each other.The race was won by Olympic marathon hopeful and former Jimmyrsquos Ten winner Stephen Scullion in ., to really set a very high standard. His time was over half a minute faster than he ran in the European Championships in Berlin two years ago.Aaron McGrady was th in . mdash not a PB by any means but a solid performance in this time of limbo.Jimmy Sloan has been raring to go since Jimmyrsquos  was called off and he showed himself race fit with a . finish for th place, which was some two minutes  seconds faster than his previous personal best. He was over the moon with this result.The womenrsquos race was won by Ann-Marie McGlynn in a new NI record time of ., with Jessica Craig nd in . and Gemma McDonald third in ..East Downrsquos Hannah Somani, only just missed on a podium place but broke  minutes in . with relative comfort. This was a particularly laudable effort and particularly pleasing for her given that she has only just ed from an injury which prevented her from training for more than two months.ConnemaraCheryl Denvir and Lisa Milligan also deserve a shout out for their weekend exploits. They were in Connemara for the Gaelforce Adventure Race which according to the race brief is a ldquostunning route involving cycling and running through the Inagh Valley, Glen Valley, Maamturk   Ben Mountain ranges, Western Way Trail and kayaking on the crystal clear waters of the Killary Fjord in the shadow of Connaughtrsquos highest mountain Mweelrea. This is Connemara from the inside out. This route with its ied terrain and dramatic views will keep you interested and get you over the line before you know it.I am not sure that they would agree with it being over before they realised mdash the run alone was a mud bath and the cycle was testing to say the least. However both athletes did themselves proud finishing well up the rankings on a tough day out.Over  entered the event and there were a fair number of DNFs. Cheryl finished in th position with a total time of two hours and  minutes. Lisa was home within the three-hour barrier and in the top half of the field, coming th.Even better, she was a clear winner in the F category with her nearest competition more than half an hour behind her Well done you two.The half marathon race was won by the redoubtable Tommy Hughes, aka the lsquoMarrakesh Expressrsquo, in a time of ., which would be a mark most would give their eye teeth to achieve.Given that Tommy is now in the over  age category, it is nothing short of incredible. Well done to him..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Spa Wells group delivers 60 good parcels to residents  ","story":"MEMBERS and volunteers of Spa Wells Cultural Association distributed  food parcels in the area recently.The parcels were delivered to elderly residents and those shielding due to coronavirus.While the lockdown restrictions continue to ease, the association says it is aware that things are still far from normal.A spokesman said distributing food parcels was one small way to help neighbours, relieve social isolation and improve the quality of le of the local community.Residents were grateful to receive non-perishable items and vacuum-packed fresh meat from Poole Butchers.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11621189.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The party made constraints on ministers one of its centre-piece demands for the restoration of Stormont, yet now, under a dferent leadership, it is helping to push through legislation that will remove those constraintsThis bill, which has been rushed through the assembly in a matter of weeks and has to date received little or no legislative scrutiny, will fundamentally affect decision-making in Northern Ireland.From the public comment on the bill, there is no appreciation of the implications of some of the proposed changes. Instead,MLAs are sleepwalking into making profound constitutional amendments. Twenty years ago ministers enjoyed considerable autonomy in relation to decisions within their department and famously the then minister for education abolished the eleven plus exam on his last day in office without recourse to the executive.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Richard Bullick, a former barrister, was special advisor to Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster as first ministerAllowing ministers such power within their departmental remits did not sit well with democratic accountability or joined up government and the DUP made the reform of these arrangements a centre-piece of its terms for the restoration of devolution. Admittedly, there was also a signicant element of being able to limit the capacity of Sinn Fein ministers to pursue their political and constitutional agenda. In a  policy document, the party argued that legislation “would be required to ensure that ultimate power would rest with the executive as opposed to the inidual departments”. To be clear the DUP’s intention was to ensure that any important decision could be required to secure executive approval and the resulting provisions meant that unionistconsent was required. The provisions that were legislated for were complex and interlocking. The underlying objective was achieved in two carefully worded statutory tests for which decisions would require executive approval. These arrangements operated successfully from  and on only a few occasions did DUP ministers feel compelled to go to court to successfully enforce the arrangements the party had largely devised. The rationale for the present bill arises out of a Court of Appeal decision to the effect that a signicant planning application required executive approval. Understandably, the executive wished to bring forward an amendment to recty that situation, but more controversially it has also chosen to amend a provision relating the carefully calibrated tests for executive approval more generally. There is little evidence that the drafters of the objectionable clauses of the bill were informed of the purpose of the original provisions. As a result the proposed changes seriously undermine the DUP’s claim to have a veto on all important decisions in NI. The essential purpose of the amendment is to redefine a test for full executive consideration in a way which would increase ministerial autonomy. This was done by limiting the meaning of what constitutes a ‘cross-cutting’ matter, reducing the range of decisions that have to come to the executive. Why then are DUP the appearing to be reversing a long-standing policy  My view is that it is not a change of policy but flows from misconceptions in what is a complex area of law.Firstly, there is a custom and practice argument which asserts that the new clause reflects the sort of matters that actually come before the executive for decision. While this may be true, it also entirely misses the point. The real issue is not what normally comes to the executive, but what can be required to come where other ministers take exception to a proposed decision.Secondly, there is the argument that the legislation restores the test for what constitutes cross-cutting to the standard which existed before the Buick decision , but after the changes brought about by the  St Andrews Agreement. The new test for cross-cutting would mean that there would be no requirement for executive agreement, “unless that matter affects the exercise of the statutory responsibilities of one or more other ministers more than incidentally”. Notably, there is no mention of ‘statutory’ responsibilities in paragraph  of the Belfast Agreement. This distinction has signicant application for s where there is no statutory underpinning for what departments do in practice. Even more signicantly the “more than incidentally” requirement, above, is demonstrably a greater level of “cross-cutting” than requirements which have already been found to satisfy the statute by the courts. These include reference to, “touches on”“issues arise in a multitude of less obvious circumstances” , “engages the responsibility of ious Ministers” .Self-evidently,the intention of the new clause had been to reflect previous case law, then the language in those judgments could have been deployed for statutory purposes. It was not. Thirdly, misplaced comfort may be taken by what is known as the ‘signicant or controversial’ test, though this simplication ignores a crucial second limb of the provision, which also requires the decision to be ‘clearly outside the scope of the agreed programme’ for government. The boundaries of this limitation are unclear, though unambiguously it weakens the short-hand catch-all test. And fourthly, it has been suggested, both at the Executive Office Committee and in the assembly, that the so-called ‘three minister call in’ provision in the legislation provides an ultimate safety net. This provision, it is said, would allow any three ministers to require a matter to come to the executive and deprive the minister of the authority to take such a decision .As the argument goes, there being four DUP ministers, this provides the needed assurance for unionists fearful of republican ministers going on ‘solo runs’. The logic of this argument is impeccable but for one rather fundamental defect. No such provision exists.This regrettable conclusion is reached, not by recourse to case law or obtuse statutory interpretation, but by a simple Google search of the relevant legislation, namely ‘section  Northern Ireland Act ’. As this safeguard has been widely cited in aid of the new provision, it is safe to assume that the entire bill is predicated upon this mistaken assumption. This is not a solid foundation for constitutional legislation. Problematically for the movers of the bill is that fact that they have to convince assembly members that the legislation, with the amendment, means exactly the same as the legislation did without it. The only intervening event was a judgment by lord chief justice where he interpreted the statute consistent with the approach the DUP have always advocated.All is not yet lost. Doug Beattie MLA has put down amendments to remove the dangerous aspects of the bill, while leaving in place the sensible provisions. These should be supported leaving the contentious aspect the bill to another day.

A youth Assembly is a fantastic setting to encourage debate and allow our young people to opportunity to hold their elected representatives to account.
