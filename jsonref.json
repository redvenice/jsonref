AMLO was then a member of the PRI party, led by President Enrique Pena Nieto, but quit in the late 1980s.After losing the Tabasco governor’s race twice, he staged protests in an attempt to raise his profile during a time in which there was increasing resistance towards the leading party. However, in 2000, AMLO was elected as the mayor of Mexico City as part of the PRD.With his first bid at the presidency in 2006, he promised to ‘put the poor first’, but his critics branded him ‘a danger for Mexico’, likening him to Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez. The election was decided by a thin margin and López Obrador claimed it had been rigged.          Mexico City\u0027s main square, the Zocalo, as Andrés Manuel López Obrador delivers his speechAMLO led protests yet again and declared that he was the legitimate president of Mexico. This led to the former Mayor speaking in villages that had not been visited by political leaders for years.One of his aides, Polimnia Romana Sierra said: ‘He spoke with the same energy under a tree in front of 10 people as he did in the full Zocalo. Nobody works the microphone like him.’He formed a new party, the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and by 2015, he was regarded as the next election winner. In addition to this, as the PRI became increasingly involved in corruption scandals, López Obrador also grew in popularity.His wife and fervent feminist, Beatriz Gutierrez, also helped to extend his appeal to female voters in Mexico.          AMLO, accompanied by wife Beatriz Gutierrez Muller, delivers his victory speech in MexicoAndrés Manuel López Obrador\u0027s policiesAfter winning the Mexican election, Andrés Manuel López Obrador must now ensure that his promises are fulfilled. Despite critics comparing AMLO to Hugo Chavez and his leftist sympathies could turn Mexico into Venezuela, he took home a landslide victory.According to the BBC, many believe that he shares an authoritarian approach and will ruin the economy, but AMLO has rejected these claims and has said that he will not carry out expropriations and will not seek re-election.However, he has promised to renew contracts awarded by the state oil company Pemex to private companies during the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto and will check they are not corrupt. He has also vowed to bring economic growth, jobs and social development programmes.‘We will carry out a peaceful transformation, ordered, but profound and even radical, because the word radical comes from root, and what we will do... is, in essence, to root out the corrupt regime,’ he said at one campaign rally.Against what he describes as the ‘power mafia’ of Mexico, he plans to increase scholarships for the young and expand welfare for the elderly, offering ‘good relations’ with the private sector and accusing business leaders of acting ‘like they owned Mexico’.AMLO has also promised to bring peace to the war on drugs, but will not continue the military-led strategy. Notably, he has also said that he would not let Mexico bow down to Trump and asked for ‘friendship’ and ‘mutual respect’ to avoid any trade war.\u0027Soon, very soon, after the victory of our movement, we will defend migrants all over the American continent and the migrants of the world who, by necessity, must abandon their towns to find life in the United States it\u0027s a human right we will defend,\u0027 Lopez Obrador said in a June speech reported by El Universal.US President Donald Trump congratulated Lopez Obrador in a tweet saying: \u0027Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!\u0027Who is Morgan Evans?

but added that the French were committed to being \u0027global actors\u0027 alongside the US. Mr Trump will travel to Europe next week for a potentially stormy NATO gathering on July 11-12, before heading to the UK.In the two-page letter, Gen Mattis said \u0027the credibility of the UK\u0027s armed forces\u0027 had been crucial in securing its place on the world stage.David Cameron DID ask Barack Obama to warn that Brexit would...Tory Brexit war catches fire as minister demands \u0027insolent\u0027...Share this articleBut he added: \u0027I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change.\u0027The UK is committed to meeting the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence, but the US hinted that it wants Mrs May to commit more money.Gen Mattis said: \u0027A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defence spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.\u0027Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk.\u0027Highlighting Mr Macron\u0027s recent pledge to pump an extra £260billion into defence by 2025, Gen Mattis said: \u0027As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defence.\u0027Other allies are following suit.\u0027          The letter has been leaked as Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson (pictured left with Mrs May and her husband Philip at an Armed Forces Day event over the weekend) lobbies hard for his budget to be expanded    Mr Trump and French president Emmanuel Macron (pictured together at the White House in April) have struck up a close rapportHe stressed that it was \u0027in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice\u0027 but \u0027in that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability\u0027.In a reference to the Whitehall rows over funding, Gen Mattis added: \u0027It is not for me to tell you how to prioritise your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defence blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.\u0027Downing Street tried to play down the row, insisting Britain has the \u0027biggest defence budget in Europe and the second biggest in Nato\u0027.‘I would point to the Nato Secretary General following his meeting with the PM where he said he appreciates Britain’s commitment and leadership in the Alliance,\u0027 the PM\u0027s spokesman said.‘The UK is above the 2 per cent contribution and we have said we will continue to meet that target.‘We, the US and France are close allies and partners willing to take action together in defence of our values.’However, the spokesman refused to state that the UK would continue to have the largest defence budget in Europe.   The week after receiving the letter, Mr Williamson told MPs that US patience over European defence spending was wearing thin.\u0027We can\u0027t continue to expect US taxpayers to keep picking up the tab for European defence indefinitely, nor can we expect US patience to last forever,\u0027 he said on June 20.The Commons Defence Committee has also called for a significant funding boost, moving the level of defence spending up from 2 per cent to 3 per cent of total GDP.A cash injection on this scale would equate to additional funding of around £20billion a year and bring investment in defence to levels similar to those seen between the end of the Cold War and the mid-1990s."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/15/4DD8569300000578-0-image-m-6_1530542225741.jpg","title":"Hard partying Malia Obama celebrates 20th birthday Montauk","story":"    Photos obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com show Malia Obama partying at the Montauk hot spot, Surf Lodge, as she celebrated her 20th birthday on Saturday afternoonShe said the group arrived on Saturday afternoon and stayed for about an hour while smoking cigarettes and \u0027partying\u0027.\u0027At one point she was just standing in a bikini,\u0027 the insider said. \u0027She wasn\u0027t in a good state, I can tell you that.\u0027The insider added that it appeared as though no one in Malia\u0027s group was drinking alcohol.Photos show wine glasses on tables near Malia at the restaurant, though the one closest to her was empty and a bottle of coconut water sat beside it.

When he outgrew that and was being sent for slaughter, Manor Farm stepped in. ‘He’s a rascal,’ says Di. ‘Having been given lots of attention, he feels it’s his right to demand fuss from visitors, who are taken by surprise when he head-butts the back of their knees!’          Bullied pig called Simon: Partially-sighted and with deformed front legs, Simon was so terribly bullied by the bigger pigs he shared a sty with at another rescue centre that they asked Manor Farm to take him. ‘He was grossly overweight which didn’t help with his movement problems — if he was a human it’s like he’s walking on his wrists,’ says Di. ‘He’s now lost weight and is enjoying life with his friend Brooke. She chivvies him around all day and I give him strawberries and melon which he loves.’          Jack the VERY stroppy Donkey: Jack was the first non-hen to be taken in by Manor Farm rescue sanctuary after it came into being about seven years ago. ‘We bought the land for it with some money left to me by my Uncle Jack,’ says Di, ‘so when a donkey sanctuary asked me to look after a donkey called Jack it seemed meant to be. The only thing is — he’s nothing like my Uncle Jack who was very gentle whereas donkey Jack is quite stroppy!’Less than a decade ago, Di and Alan were both running businesses from their Nottinghamshire village home.Now they’re also running an animal sanctuary that currently cares for more than 100 farmyard creatures. And not just any creatures. They take in the ones no one else wanted, rejected because they were disabled, had health problems, special needs or simply grew too old.Or, in the case of the many rescued from petting zoos, simply because they grew up. ‘People imagine these animals are living a lovely life in the petting zoo until they die naturally,’ says Di, ‘but that’s not so in the majority of cases.Adorable moment Limbani the chimpanzee shrieks with joy and...Fury at female Kentucky hunter who posted sickening photos...Share this article‘Lambs can be bred out of season to be Christmas attractions to be bottle-fed by visitors but once they’ve grown out of the cute stage, they go into the food chain.’What’s more, they often come to her emaciated, neglected and infested with parasites. Then the battle is on to save their lives. That battle costs Manor Farm Charitable Trust up to £100,000 a year — around a fifth of which are vets’ bills.‘Our vets are constantly challenged by the ageing of our animals,’ Di admits.No wonder — it’s rare farmyard creatures live more than a year or two before going to be slaughtered.          Blind Stevie\u0027s a littler wonder: When blind Stevie the Mallard duck came to Manor Farm, they knew he needed a friend to guide him round. ‘I chose a girl called Wanda,’ says Di, ‘because female ducks are louder than the boys and I believed he needed someone noisy to follow around.’ Stevie was found with big scabs over his eyes. ‘We didn’t know at first if he’d been attacked, if they were infected or even if he had eyes. He did — but he was blind.’ Now Wanda’s his guide duck.          Toothless OAP fed on a banana: Life’s left Dolly so scared of human strangers that when summer comes Di can’t call in a shearer —instead she has to do it herself with nail scissors. Dolly, a breeding nanny at a farm park, came to Manor Farm in 2012 when they started neglecting her because she’d become barren. ‘She barely had the strength to hold her head up,’ says Di. ‘But she had an indomitable spirit we could all do with.’ Dolly, who has no teeth, was fattened up with mashed banana and is now in the equivalent of her 90s.          Stumble, duck who live up to his name: Stumble may only have one leg but he’s still the scourge of the female ducks he shares his enclosure with. ‘He’s perfected the ability to jump on to a mate,’ says Di. ‘They all run but they can’t hide from him. Stumble’s leg had to be amputated after getting caught in fishing wire. He’s had a difficult summer because he’s moulted and lost his tail feather and wing tips — which help keep him stable. So he keeps falling over.’ And falling in love.          Goat that costs £3,000 to perk up: Of all the Manor Farm animals, Jo cost the most. So thin when Di rescued him from a petting zoo that he couldn’t hold his neck up, she nursed him back to health in her kitchen. ‘He came up to me as if to say “help me,” ’ she says. Jo was covered in lice and had digestive problems. ‘We nearly lost him several times — he was always the one needing the vet at midnight,’ says Di. But she doesn’t begrudge a penny of the £3,000 he cost. ‘He’s the sweetest creature,’ she says.But it’s not just the vets who have been learning. Di has too. ‘In 2010 I treated myself to four hens as a reward for completing an MA in creative writing and I found it was a slippery slope ,’ she says.A year later, a relative died, leaving her money to buy the six-acre field behind the house. Slowly the brood grew and the dozen or so enclosures now house 64 hens, 27 goats, two donkeys, one pony, two pigs and 30 sheep.Di now employs a full-time member of staff and three part-timers. Every day begins at 6am when she gets the feed ready. It ends at 10.30pm — earlier in winter — when she puts the animals to bed. She also finds time to run her publishing business (and Alan his marketing consultancy firm) which help bankroll Manor Farm.          Ewe with a stiff neck: Born with a twisted neck, Hilda was too deformed to breed and too skinny to slaughter so Di took the tiny ewe in. \u0027We were told she\u0027d never take to humans,\u0027 she eat out of a trough because she\u0027d never seen them before. But within a month she was letting us touch her and gradually she got a lust for life. Now she loves to be cuddled and her tail wags madly like a big dog          A goat the size of a pony: Ronnie, the Anglo Nubian goat, is the size of a Shetland pony. ‘They’re a large breed but he’s a particular giant,’ says Di, ‘and that’s how he ended up here — his elderly owner couldn’t cope with the size of him and was going to have him shot.’ So she did a 135-mile round trip to save him. ‘I knew he was big but even so it was a bit of a shock when I saw him.’Other money comes from corporate and personal donations and the sale of eggs and wool from the animals online. Apart from cash worries, there are other downsides. ‘I’ve had every injury known to man — I’ve lost a nail to a goat horn, been electrocuted by a fence and accidentally injected myself with goat antibiotics,’ says Di.But this pales into insignificance compared to the pain of losing one of their beloved creatures. The sanctuary is full so it’s only with the death of an animal that another can be saved. They come from farm parks, via social media or from other rescue centres.‘It is hard work,’ says Di, ‘but when you see the sheep feeding on the grass and the goats happy in their enclosure, it’s worth it.’          Hen healed in a roasting tray: Buffy the ex-battery hen was doing perfectly well at Manor Farm when she was sat on by another bird and left with a bruised back last winter. ‘One of my biggest joys was that we got Buffy back to health with daily physio,’ says Di. ‘Although I do feel a bit guilty that we kept her in a roasting tray so she could rest her neck on the edge of it. She’s still a bit stiff and walks with a bit of a goose step but is otherwise fine. And she now loves cuddles — every time you pass her she wants you to pick her up.’          Sheep who need a dentist: Dumpy is easy to spot: his teeth have grown so big, his jaw is deformed. ‘But you really couldn’t meet a sweeter sheep,’ says Di. She saved him from the slaughterhouse last year — he was on a trailer bound for it when the farmer’s daughter put out a social media appeal. ‘We all clubbed together to buy him and the farmer said we could have him — as long as we gave the money to Comic Relief,’ says Di. But those teeth keep the dentist busy.Manor Farm Charitable Trust | Lifelong sanctuary for livestock in need"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/01/4DC0BF0100000578-5911421-Rebekah_Vardy_pictured_at_England_s_game_against_Belgium_has_bee-a-42_1530577904871.jpg","title":"World Cup WAG thinks her","story":"    Flying the flag: England striker Jamie Vardy\u0027s wife RebekahHer sharp-shooting husband could fire England into the World Cup quarter-finals tonight.But as the nation holds its breath, striker Jamie Vardy\u0027s wife Rebekah is hogging as much of the limelight as she can – claiming her husband\u0027s success is partly down to her.The 36-year-old reality TV star has been doing media interviews almost daily while in Russia with her family.She has also been sharing pictures online of her time with other WAGs, boarding private jets and going on extravagant shopping trips, as well as the inevitable glamorous matchday selfies.Estimates suggest 20million people will watch the game on TV in Britain tonight and 36million pints of beer are expected to be drunk across the country today – 17million in pubs and 19million at home.The British Beer and Pub Association also predicted £25million would be spent on food in pubs today and £30million on meals eaten at home.Meanwhile, the National Grid expects electricity demand to spike by 700 megawatts at half-time – equivalent to 27million fridge doors opening at the same time as fans grab another beer.The grid\u0027s director of system operations Duncan Burt said: \u0027We\u0027ll balance supply and demand second by second in real time.\u0027Rebekah Vardy (pictured at England\u0027s game against Belgium, left, and on social media, right) has been doing media interviews almost daily while in Russia with her family and sharing pictures online England face Colombia at 7pm in the 45,000-seater Spartak Stadium in Moscow, with around 4,000 of their fans thought to have travelled to Russia. Mrs Vardy will be there too of course, cheering the team – and herself – on.She claimed yesterday the national side had prospered thanks to the presence of their loved ones.Kim Kardashian proves she IS a Beyonce fan as she bops along...Love Island: Megan cements viewers\u0027 opinions that she is a...Love Island: Georgia is left RAGING as Josh re-couples with...Adorable moment Limbani the chimpanzee shrieks with joy and...Share this articleShe said coach Gareth Southgate has helped get the most out of the players by allowing them time alone with their families and friends, unlike during previous tournaments.She told The Sun: \u0027He\u0027s got the right idea of the team mentality.

The best way to succeed is to avoid the slippery torsos, and aim for fellow competitors’ trousers, called kismet          Limbering up before going onto the grassed wrestling zone, these competitors have already been covered in olive oil for the traditional event, which dates back two millennia. Oil wrestling is believed to be the closest to ancient Greek wrestling in style. However, in ancient times, the Greeks would have competed naked, as they did in all sports          Bare torso, and with bare feet, this wrestler is donning thick trousers made of calfskin leather. Some wrestlers also wear jeans. The trousers the men wear are made of thick leather in a traditional design called kisbet. In recent years manufacturers have changed from traditional buffalo to calfskin. While durable, sometimes they are torn apart in the fighting          Wrestlers covered in olive oil fight in an annual traditional oil wrestling competition in the northern Greek village of Sochos. Muscular men walk around the lawn, which is turned into a wrestling ring, to the tune of traditional music, with their torsos slathered in olive oil for the yearly festival that blends the traditions of ancient Greece and more modern times          Fights take place simultaneously in a large field, and unlike most combat sports there is no set field or arena. The wrestlers are free to roam around as the fight takes them, and are typically followed by a referee. Unlike Greco-Roman wrestling, which relies heavily on technical ability, oil wrestling is more a test of endurance          In tears: a wrestler covered in olive oil reacts after taking part in an annual traditional oil wrestling competition in the northern Greek village of Sochos. The oil makes it harder for the wrestler to grip opponents, so this type of combat needs a certain strategy, besides strength, to succeed          Oil wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world, which dates back to the ancient city of Babylon but is still practiced across Turkey and in northern parts of Greece. There is no score in the event. The winner is the man who manages to throw his opponent onto the ground so that his shoulders touch the soil          Prior to the matches, wrestlers cover their bodies in olive oil as they prepare to compete in the event. It is not unusual for competitors to oil one another, above, to show mutual respect. The traditional sport of oil wrestling in Greece has continued from generation to generation          Spectators watch as wrestlers covered in oil take part in an annual traditional oil wrestling competition, in the northern Greek village of Sochos.

The coroner ruled her death had been contributed to by neglect.After meeting the families, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised and commissioned the report, which makes 12 recommendations.

Izzy fell unconscious by the time she got to A\u0026ampE and doctors said it was serious and she was taken into intensive care. Less than half an hour later, she was diagnosed with meningitis.Izzy was stabilised, but her condition got worse and her organs shut down.

Warning of intervention powers over executive pay and idends, Ofwat said it would run an assessment over the winter to check whether water companies were doing enough to link performance-related pay to customer delivery. Firms will submit their business plans, including their pay and idend policies, to the regulator this September.Rachel Fletcher, the watchdog’s chief executive, said: “The decisions some water companies have made on idends, financial structures and top executive pay have damaged customer trust.”She added that Ofwat would strengthen the incentive on companies to improve their performance for customers, while cutting the rewards that come from financial engineering – which involves firms ratcheting up their debts and using complex corporate structures.“This is an important step in making sure water companies put customers’ interests and those of future generations, at the heart of all the decisions they take,” she said.Water industry bosses faced sharp criticism last month after the GMB trade union found they had banked £58m in pay and benefits over the last five years while customers have faced above-inflation rises in their water bills.The move from Ofwat also comes after the environment secretary, Michael Gove, attacked water companies for paying their bosses large salaries and huge idends to shareholders while contributing little or no tax.Labour has promised to bring water companies back into public ownership to save households money, amid rising public anger over pay and poor performance.Ofwat issued a damning report last month, finding that water companies badly let down their customers during the “beast from the east” weather earlier this year. More than 200,000 households were cut off, yet compensation payouts totalled only £7m.

Is the city finally shaking off its reputation as a hub for cheap tech labour?There are two things that the streets of Bengaluru are full of: bars and software developers. Take a seat at your watering hole of choice, and it won’t be long before you hear murmurs of startups, VCs and funding at a neighbouring table. This is where the entrepreneurs of Bengaluru (known as Bangalore until November 2014) come to meet – in the coffee shops, bars and restaurants of one of India’s most buzzing cities.“The tech scene and entrepreneurial spirit in Bengaluru are booming,” says Niketh Sabbineni, a local tech entrepreneur who sold his company, Bookpad, to Yahoo in 2014. Although from the Indian city of Hyderabad, he and his cofounders moved to Bengaluru straight out of college in search of three things: access to entrepreneurs, talent and venture capital.They’re not alone in choosing it as a base to launch a business. In 2017, the World Economic Forum named it the world’s most dynamic city, based on factors including innovation and technology. (This year it was overtaken by Hyderabad, whose state government has implemented a number of strategies to encourage tech entrepreneurship in the city.) However, the deal is not without its controversy. Yesterday (July 2), small business owners organised protests in several Indian cities, arguing the US giant would skew the field against the traders who depend on FlipKart for their livelihood.Bengaluru has come a long way since the inception of its IT industry. By 1983, two soon-to-be-giants of India’s fledgling tech industry – Infosys and Wipro – had moved their head offices to Bangalore. Other tech companies followed, growing their businesses around the two firms. This included foreign companies looking to cut costs by employing cheap local developers. The IT outsourcing model was born. On the one hand, the new jobs raised living standards for Bengaluru’s citizens and made them digital natives, but on the other, it branded the city as a place for cheap labour and one that lacked its own ideas.Emilien Coquard is a French developer who moved to Bengaluru in 2011, and now runs a software recruitment agency connecting foreign companies with local talent. Since arriving, he’s seen the city’s tech culture change. “There’s been a shift from a software-factory model to a startup mindset,” he says. “Twenty years ago people entered IT engineering because that’s where the jobs were – now they’re doing it because they’re genuinely interested in tech, and they’re super excited to be working in software development.”Coquard uses the example of Dunzo, an app that connects people looking for help with tasks to others who’ll accept payment for completing them, as evidence of the entrepreneurial mindset he believes is deep-rooted in Indian culture. Dunzo started as a WhatsApp group, before the founders turned it into an app. Now, Google has invested £9m in it. This entrepreneurial spirit is bolstered in Bengaluru by a number of programmes and government initiatives aimed at supporting the city’s tech scene. One is the not-for-profit 10,000 Startups, which connects startups with funders, accelerators and mentors, with a view to building 10,000 new businesses in the city by 2024.Suresh Jayaraju, a senior director at 10,000 Startups, says that progress has been swift since the business’s inception, four years ago. The incubator is now reorienting its focus away from the quantity of startups and towards their quality, as well as to concentrate on certain sectors. In particular, the programme is focusing on deep tech, such as blockchain, AI and machine learning.Jayaraju sees this as an area in which Bengaluru could lead the world. While the city lacks the expertise of more established tech hubs, such as San Francisco’s Bay Area or London, everyone across the world is at an early stage in deep tech, so the playing field is level, he says. “Having started with this so early, we can still have an advantage. If we have the right ideas, we can definitely get funded.”“Women staying at home is more of a norm here,” says Hena Mehta, a tech entrepreneur who started a Lean In chapter for Bangalore. “Even educated women who went to college and had jobs before getting married tend to choose to stay at home and raise kids.”While larger companies often have equality and ersity policies aimed at increasing female representation, startups tend to recruit on a “talent-first” basis. Mehta is currently building a team for her own startup, and says she doesn’t have the resources to find enough female candidates. “I literally haven’t seen a single woman’s resume come through for software engineering,” she says. While Bengaluru still has some catching up to do, its tech scene is definitely starting to get the attention of the rest of the world – and this time not just as a source of cheap labour. Last month, US incubator Techstars launched its first startup accelerator programme in Bengaluru. Vishal Ramaswamy, community lead for Techstars, sees this as a vote of confidence in the city’s entrepreneurial culture. This is echoed in the reverse brain drain that Ramaswamy says Bengaluru is experiencing. “There are a lot of people of Indian origin who’re in the US – investors, corporate folks, serial entrepreneurs – who’re slowly coming back to India,” he says. “They’ve got US experience and contacts, and they’re coming back to set up businesses in India.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/808842e28c7042a5fbc714c2fb566feb1a5d3c2b/0_51_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2158495c906dfec0da385c2d30163c4d","title":"all humanity has left the area the cities paying for tesla gigafactory","story":"Tesla’s battery factory brought high-paid tech jobs to Nevada – but is soaking up huge tax breaks that critics say have seriously depleted public servicesWhen Nevada enticed Tesla to set up a gargantuan battery factory in the desert, America’s gambling capital seemed to have hit the jackpot.The factory would have a state-of-the art 5.5m sq ft (510967 sq meter) facility – reputedly the world’s biggest building by footprint – and promised to generate tens of thousands of jobs, as well as investment worth $100bn (£76bn).Cities around the so-called Gigafactory in northern Nevada lined up to reap the bonanza. No longer dusty, provincial versions of Las Vegas, these municipalities would become innovative makers of lithium-ion batteries for electric cars and partners in Elon Musk’s vision of a clean-energy revolution.That was the pitch. These days many residents in Sparks – a sunbaked, low-rise city of 100,000 people located 20 miles from the factory – express humbler dreams: food, shelter, health care.“I’m not used to living this way,” said Katherine Pope, 69, a retired administrator who rents a small motel room and relies on food donations. “I can’t afford to move. Many times I can’t afford meat.” Another impoverished resident, a 70-year-old unemployed transcriptionist with a thyroid condition, faces a recurring dilemma. “Food or medicine, it’s one or the other.” A rent increase may soon compel another grim choice: sleep in her battered 1997 Saturn or in a homeless shelter.Down by the Truckee river you find others who feel cast out – families who have moved into trailer parks, which are packed to capacity, and people sleeping rough. “A year ago I was the caretaker of an apartment building and my wife was a caregiver. Then I lost my job. We couldn’t afford to rent anywhere so now we live here,” said Kevin McCullough, 48, who like his partner, Pixie, was sunburnt from outdoor living. Home is a tent by riverbank reeds.Such testimony conflicts with the official narrative that Sparks is booming – awash with jobs, money and newcomers. But you hear it from a largely hidden underclass which is paying a price for the boom. Some have a term for it: “Tesla’d.”One complaint is that tax credits given to Tesla – and to a lesser extent other tech companies – deplete public services, resulting in potholed roads, overcrowded schools and insufficient affordable housing.The other is that the tech worker influx has sent rents rocketing, tipping residents on fixed incomes, especially seniors, into penury.That was not the pitch in 2014 when Nevada beat rival bids from California and New Mexico to land the Gigafactory. It did so with exemptions from sales-and-use, property and general business taxes for 10 to 20 years, adding up to an estimated and unprecedented $1.4bn. The previous record, to lure an Apple server farm, was $88m. Brian Sandoval, the Republican governor, hailed the deal as transformative for a region still limping from the great recession. Today the factory sits behind a fenced swath of desert known as the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC), which also hosts Google, Switch and Panasonic, among others, and bills itself the world’s biggest industrial park.Tesla’s “alien dreadnought” – Musk’s words – dominates. It is unfinished but already produces around 3,000 battery packs per week for Tesla’s Model 3 sedan. Thousands of workers and contractors have moved to Sparks and nearby communities, a boon for local hotels, landlords, builders, plumbers, electricians, taxi drivers and other service providers.A Tesla spokesperson said the company was investing in local education, including a high school manufacturing development programme and a $37.5m plan to promote science, technology, engineering and mathematics.Tesla receives credits based on jobs created, Ron Knecht, Nevada’s state controller, said in an interview. “They’re reaching their benchmarks significantly faster than expected.”Current Tesla projections suggest the credits are justified even if the ultimate cost is unclear, said Knecht. “If it pans out the way it looks, it’ll certainly be good for the economy. The state may break even but we’ll never really know.”A Republican, Knecht’s job is to protect taxpayers’ money. Figures from his office, supplied under a mandate for transparency in corporate welfare, show how much tax abatements reduced potential revenues for local authorities in fiscal year 2017. In the case of Tesla it was $68.7m.Credits to Musk’s company will soak up most of a tax revenue excess Nevada was due to record this year.The state compensates local government, said Knecht. Had Tesla never come there would have been nothing to tax, so the costbenefit remains murky. “You can get numbers all over the place.”Here’s one number that applies to Sparks: zero.Stephen Driscoll, the city manager, said despite surging population growth and increased strain on police and fire departments and schools, his annual budget had increased from $65m to $70m in the past two years – about the level of inflation. “So I’m at net zero.”Critics of the system say there is no doubt who ultimately pays. “It’s the working stiffs,” said Bob Fulkerson, of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada. Schools in Washoe county, which includes Sparks, are overcrowded and deeply in debt, so much so that voters in 2016 approved a sales tax hike to help plug the gap. Even so, fresh budget cuts could eliminate bus routes for nearly 4,000 elementary and middle school students in an effort to save $550,000.Tesla, meanwhile, has sold $131m in tax credits to casinos thanks to transferable tax credits – the cherry on the cake used to lure Musk.“Corporate welfare is a way of life in these parts,” said Andrew Barbano, a veteran commentator. Ordinary people bore the brunt in the form of regressive sales and gas taxes and impoverished services, he said. “Nevada is addicted to hidden indirect taxes.”Robert Fellner, of the Nevada Policy Research Institute, said politicians had warped incentives. Rather than create a fair tax system and balanced growth they wanted to be able to point at giant factories and say “we did that”. Jenny Brekhus, a city planner and member of Reno city council, said Nevada could not afford corporate welfare. “I don’t believe you can be a low tax, low service state and play this economic development game where you give away tax revenue.”In Sparks the result is a stark gap between winners and losers. Home owners have seen values soar – but not property taxes, which are capped. Plumbers, electricians and builders have bountiful job options. “The factory is a good thing,” said Omar Alvarez, 28, a building contractor who earned $18 an hour plus generous benefits at Tesla’s factory. “Well, as long as you actually work there.”Residents on fixed incomes, in contrast, are facing surging rents, driving some to destitution and the brink of homelessness. Trailer parks which were half-empty two years ago are now jammed, said Alicia Siever, who manages the River’s Edge RV park. Motels and shelters have also filled. “I get depressed. All humanity has left the area,” said Pope, who used to work in an architect’s office. Her $700 per month ground-floor motel room is a dramatic comedown from her previous apartments. “But I’m grateful this place exists.”The unemployed transcriptionist declined to be named lest identification sabotage her last-ditch attempt to avoid eviction. Asked to name unaffordable luxuries, she replied: “Ice cream. Bacon. A movie ticket.”A troubling question now hovers over Sparks. Is Tesla itself a winner or loser?Having bet on the Gigafactory, the city’s fate hinges on the company’s success, said Richard Daly, business manager of Laborers’ Union Local 169. “Growth problems are better than recession problems.”But a spate of setbacks – layoffs, achurn of executives, workplace safety complaints, “autopilot” car crashes and a suit against a whistleblower – has put pressure on the firm. “Giving so much to Tesla was risky,” said Eloy Jara, another labour leader. “If they fail it could really hurt.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1102e3f70ac6724fe7789b39bbbd3d1bdc38b446/0_71_3532_2120/master/3532.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f40bcffaff8a0aaa586fa40ff20b7692","title":"a women only private island is not empowering it is elitist","story":"A trip to SuperShe Island in the Baltic Sea costs £3,500. But the trend for exclusive networking groups aimed at wealthy women only sets back gender equalityOff the coast of Finland, immured in the Baltic Sea, there is a private island where men are banned and only a select few women, with suitably large bank accounts, are allowed to set foot. It is called SuperShe Island and it is the international headquarters of the SuperShe society.When I first heard about this women-only island, I thought – rather hopefully – that it might be a SuperSapphic version of Love Island. Desert Island Dykes, perhaps? No such luck. There is nothing filthy about SuperShe Island rather, it is all about the lucre. SuperShe, you see, is basically an upmarket networking group for well-off women. If you have €4,000 (£3,500) to spare and you are willing to undergo a rigorous interview, it offers you the chance to spend the week on a “wellness” retreat miles from men, mingling with other affluent, influential women.Before any men start getting indignant, I should make it clear that SuperShe Island is not the product of a man-hating mind far from it. As Kristina Roth, the founder of SuperShe, explains on the website: “Women need to spend time with other women. Being on vacation with men can cause women to become sidetracked, whether it’s to put on a swipe of lipstick or grab for a cover-up.”It was quite the education reading this I had no idea straight women were so easily distracted by putting on lipstick for men. It made me worry about heterosexual people.SuperShe Island also offers lots of yoga (it is basically illegal not to do yoga at upmarket retreats), organic food and various life-improving exercises, including cognitive exercises to expel negative thoughts. I would love to know exactly how these cognitive exercises work, because the more I read about SuperShe Island (it has had a ton of press lately – there is something about banning men that seems to get people interested), the more my brain was besieged by negative thoughts. What fresh faux-feminist hell is this, I wondered. Please tell me this is not yet another example of a newly minted women-only space painting itself as empowering when it is clearly elitist?I say “yet another example”, because there has been a boom in bouji spaces exclusive to women. There is the Wing, for example, a fashionable women-only co-working space and social club with locations across the US and a space in London on the way. Membership costs from $2,350 (£1,800) a year and there is a waiting list. Then there is the AllBright, an exclusive women-only members’ club in London that opened earlier this year and costs at least £975 to join. There is Women Fest, too, the UK’s first all-female festival, which is scheduled to take place in August. (It costs £225 to attend, but some of the profits will go to a tree charity, so I guess that is OK.) I could go and on, but you get the picture: the old boys’ club is being challenged.“Do you think I have big dyke energy?” I asked my girlfriend the other day. She looked me up and down and sighed. “Is this a Twitter thing? You really need to spend less time on Twitter, you know.”While it is true that I should spend less time on Twitter, the social network is also an invaluable source of useless information. Last week, for example, Twitter brought the concept of “big dick energy” into the national consciousness. A single tweet launched a thousand explainers in outlets ranging from the BBC to GQ to the . If you missed the column inches devoted to the concept, it basically means being hugely confident.But enough with the phalluses, please. Let’s talk about BDE 2.0, which is big dyke energy. The internet is yet to settle on an official definition of this, but it involves being comfortably self-assured without being cocky being confident without conforming to gender stereotypes. You don’t have to be gay to have big dyke energy, but you do have to challenge heterocentric norms about womanhood.Big dyke energy may sound like a throwaway internet joke, but trying to conceptualise what it means is a worthwhile exercise, because it gets you thinking about existing female tropes. There is the cool girl the crazy ex-girlfriend the old maid the Stepford wife the gold-digger the femme fatale the scorned woman the cougar the damsel in distress the ingenue and so on. When you start looking at how we categorise women, it quickly becomes apparent that most of these tropes revolve around men.What is great about the idea of big dyke energy is that it reflects a growing acceptance of women deriving their energy not from men’s approval, but from themselves.The political climate offers plenty of reasons to lie awake in a panic. But here is a new one: owls. I have always thought owls look evil, but I had never interrogated their malevolence. That changed when I watched a Netflix true-crime show called The Staircase and started reading about the murder trial it documents. You see, there is a theory that the woman who dies in The Staircase is the victim of an angry owl. While that may sound nonsensical, owl attacks are not uncommon. Indeed, last week, Iain Lee, a TalkRadio presenter, said he was viciously attacked by an owl. I don’t want that to prey on your mind, but please be careful out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d95284de8dc3f2c4524ccd78650b3f15486ce94e/0_142_4929_2957/master/4929.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da2af0b1326a5ac97e7e75f524d4a6a4","title":"city properties homes people first london barcelona","story":"As the mayors of London and Barcelona, we see an emergency coming. The way housing works must be changedFor a number of years, cities around the world have been facing increasingly global and aggressive speculation in their property markets – from speculators who see housing in our cities as an asset from which to profit, rather than homes for the people we represent.In many cases, speculators take decisions from thousands of miles away. Yet for us their impact on the life and soul of our cities is very close to home. Our city centres risk being hollowed out as vibrant communities are displaced, local shops are closed, and the cost of housing rises exorbitantly.Our community groups and local government, as the part of civic life closest to local people and the most sensitive to their everyday problems, have often been the first to warn of the risks that these practices bring with them regarding the very survival of our cities.For city leaders to be able to tackle this problem, they urgently need greater resources and powers both to increase their stocks of social-rented and other genuinely affordable housing and to strengthen tenants’ rights.Cities are not simply a collection of buildings, streets and squares. They are also the sum of their people. They are the ones who help create social ties, build communities and evolve into the places where we are so proud to live.That is why we are determined to change the way that housing works in the cities we represent. We are building more social-rented and other genuinely affordable homes, doing all we can to strengthen the rights of tenants, and clamping down on bad practices of developers and landlords wherever we are able to.But we face a complex problem and one that operates at a global level. We still lack the powers and resources that would allow us properly to regulate the housing market, to protect tenants’ rights to remain in their homes, and to make homelessness and rough sleeping things of the past.Meanwhile, our national governments, by contrast seem happy to abandon cities to their fate. We are calling on them to address this problem by providing the resources and powers we need to build all the social-rented and other genuinely affordable homes we need, and to make sure tenants are protected in their homes. Global cities are facing a housing emergency. If we do not ensure that the purpose of housing is, first and foremost, to provide homes for our citizens rather than speculative assets, we will struggle to build liveable cities for our citizens for generations to come.Mayors and local governments of world cities are working together to share knowledge and find solutions to the housing crisis. It is our duty to do everything possible to all citizens improve their lives and participate fully in our communities. We will only succeed if we can make sure everyone in our cities has access to a decent, secure and affordable home.• Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London and Ada Colau is the mayor of Barcelona"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b78a53b327312838d1d3bf8e981beb2e5d011490/0_183_2674_1604/master/2674.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8096056ee33e877b2d0f40b18328d41f","title":"disney metoo princess frozen","story":"Disney reaches a huge, young audience that is internalising ideals of white supremacy and sexualisationElsa from Frozen has been chilling in her ice closet for a long time: the hit Disney musical was released in the UK in 2013. Since then, like passive-aggressive Christmas carollers who won’t go away, fans have taunted her with the loaded words, “Do you want to build a snowman? … Come out the door,” while she stalks through her fortress of solitude like Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard, or US first lady Melania Trump.Elsa may soon be building a snowman without shame or secrecy: the film’s director and writer, Jennifer Lee, is considering bringing the ice regent’s homosexuality out to thaw in a Disney dawn of acceptance and financial profit in the Frozen sequel.When it comes to desired characteristics of Disney princesses, the usual things come up in YouGov’s poll: independence, confidence, intelligence, ambition and bravery. Nobody wants a protagonist who is a needy, dim, mousy coward with no life goals. But the top quality? Kindness. You’re joking. Disney princes should be kinder – like that manipulative hostage-taker and groomer the Beast, or the prince in Sleeping Beauty who sexually assaults a drugged-by-magic princess. These are the Disney douchebags who need a kindness makeover, or a prison sentence.This poll, while seeming to probe the wokeness of the Mouseketeers, is just another Miss World beauty pageant for assessing and ranking women. Who is the nicest, the fairest, the sweetest in the land? Which girl-woman, tiny-waisted fantasy figure, exotic or not, occupies the impossible sweet spot of nice face, true heart, great hair, good humour, fine mind, high spirits, brave soul and strong resolve?No woman, real or cartoon, can match up to that. What I want to know about Disney is this: how does it treat the women and people of colour in its own company? How much does it pay us? How does it treat its cleaners and support staff, its new mothers and the young women who want to work in the industry? What are its pitch meetings like: 10 rich, loud-talking men around a table, inventing poor “erse” heroines? Is it time for Disney to hear a #MeToo song?Disney reaches a huge, young audience that is absorbing and internalising white supremacy, the tyranny of femininity, female isolation (few of the princesses have prominent female friends), ageism against women (so many Disney villains are older women), the class system (if in doubt, marry rich), bullshit romantic myths and US cultural dominance. Disney is the western patriarchal capitalist industrialist complex in cartoon form and its female characters are overwhelmingly beautiful, feminine, sexualised, nubile, Aryan, thin, young and adorable, like snack items modelled out of refined sugar. When its fans aren’t carefully answering poll questions to make themselves look open-minded and just list their favourites, they reveal that they like their princesses just like their Starbucks coffees: hot, skinny and white.• Bidisha is a journalist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10b0c1c1ef6c58bf0b3fc34cc5b952399339afa2/0_311_4849_2910/master/4849.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccf4ad304e2689ba4f3993f3dea78be7","title":"women retailing work house of fraser john lewis closures","story":"One of my abiding childhood memories is of being dragged, protesting, through the streets of Manchester by a mother who hated shopping and for whom the main aim was to get home again quickly as possible.The worst shopping trips, from my point of view, were those involving the Kendals department store on Deansgate, where we would go to buy gym knickers or some other dull but necessary item: they involved an often rain-sodden route march of more than a mile from Piccadilly station. Later I had my first summer holiday job at Kendals, selling glittered T-shirts and last season’s women’s coats during the sale.Kendals has survived the announcement that House of Fraser is closing 31 of its 59 stores as that old city centre shopping experience becomes a thing of the past. And while my memories of its polished glass counters and upmarket loos are somewhat mixed, the reaction to store closures elsewhere has been one of dismay.Linda from Exeter was pretty typical: she told the BBC that the Dingles store in Plymouth was “always the place to go”. “When I was a child and my grandparents lived there, we always went into town and went into Dingles. It was the quality store in Plymouth,” she said.The BBC went on to report that about 250 jobs could be affected in the city, where, in 1951, 40,000 people apparently showed up to view the new state-of-the art escalator when the store reopened after being bombed.House of Fraser is a national institution, and there’s bound to be a nostalgic tint to coverage of its tribulations. But it’s striking, isn’t it, that while thousands of people are losing their jobs in troubled retail chains – Poundworld, Homebase and even John Lewis among them – news about the high street seems to be dominated by shoppers, rather than employees?Admit it: when you see a headline about large numbers of workers facing redundancy, don’t you tend to think about car plants, or steelworks? That’s because those headlines aren’t usually about shops. A quick Google news search tells a story: recent headlines on job loss fears do include retail, but are dominated by Rolls-Royce, Airbus and Jaguar Land Rover.It makes me wonder whether there isn’t another, rather odd, kind of nostalgia at play here – a nostalgia for a world in which “jobs” was code for “men’s jobs”.Somehow, we still think of those heavy industries as the bedrock of our economy: they aren’t. There are now about 2.5m manufacturing jobs – less than half the number 40 years ago. There are about 3 million people in retail jobs, and another couple of million in wholesale.When it comes to employment, rather than shopping, our sense of national identity seems still to be linked to a past – largely fictional of course – when real men did manual jobs and real women went to places like Dingles of Plymouth. (I can still remember what my sister’s father-in-law said when he learned what I earned as a journalist on a national newspaper: “That’s a man’s wage!”), Actually, retail isn’t dying – it’s just changing, despite the gloomy headlines. When you look at the official statistics it’s showing healthy growth. And so is women’s work. Yet if you just read the headlines, you’d hardly notice.A third of women are now the main breadwinners for their families – why can’t we bring ourselves to acknowledge or even to celebrate that? Hilariously, this news was greeted in the Daily  women’s page with the headline: “Female breadwinners. Why earning more can poison your marriage”.It’s not all good news – jobs in the sectors where women work are often part-time and low wage – according to Acas, most of the calls it receives about zero-hours contracts come from workers in female-dominated sectors such as retailing, personal care or hospitality. And in terms of public debate, women’s work remains largely invisible. There are high-profile exceptions – films such as Made in Dagenham, for instance – but even they tend to celebrate the struggles of women operating in a man’s world.All this makes me think of Margaret Bondfield, who started out as a shopworker in the late 19th century and who later became the UK’s first female cabinet minister – an unsung heroine if ever there was one. She joined a trades union and began writing undercover reports about conditions in London’s Oxford Street, where she worked 65 hours a week for £40 a year, half of which was deducted for bed and board.Where are today’s Margaret Bondfields? They are certainly out there, and some of them are clamouring to be heard – more than 15,000 have signed up for an ongoing claim on equal pay. Maybe it’s time we all started listening.• Fran Abrams is a journalist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace808571d82f813bee843e2e1b530de1f9ae00a/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d89820588a664ac21bb74ba7b8f6eb5a","title":"world cup russia england fans","story":"Fans warned against travelling to the World Cup in Russia for fear of hooligans are missing a treat – the locals have been amazingThis. World. Cup. Is. Good. Having been lucky enough to be at Nizhny Novgorod for England 6 Panama 1 (stick that in your hats), St Petersburg for Argentina 2 Nigeria 1 (Messi’s foot of God) and Kaliningrad for Belgium against England (the game was literally pointless), I get to write in the  to say my personal experience is that Russia is absolutely killing this World Cup, which is a vast improvement on spies in Zizzi*. The organisation of this tournament has been fantastic and you’ll struggle to find anyone who’ll say otherwise, which is not because they’re a double-agent or a Twitter bot, but because it’s true.Newspaper headlines “Bloodthirsty hooligans vow murder”, “Russian Ultras: KID BOOTCAMP” and “Russian hooligans warn England fans ‘prepare to DIE’’’. A BBC documentary called Russia’s Hooligan Army. A Foreign Office warning of “heightened risks of violence”. What do these things have in common? Well, they all sound like things Ross Kemp would mumble in his sleep, but they are also UK media reports that put a lot of English people off having an experience like mine and having the opportunity to experience first-hand which country puts us out on penalties.It’s so trite to say the people have been amazing (it annoys me when people come back from a country and say “the people were amazing”, it’s like, come on, they can’t all have been amazing, there had to be at least one dickhead in Mozambique) but the response of the Russian populace to England fans has been the polar opposite of what we were told to guard against. Mark Roberts, head of UK football policing, warned against taking England flags to Russia for fear of being too imperialistic and inciting violence. He might have felt a little silly in Victory Square, Kaliningrad, with St George’s crosses draped over every inch of the U Gasheka pub, native onlookers cheering along to the Umbro-clad mire of English lager-lads singing adapted Atomic Kitten songs (“Southgate you’re the one, you still turn me on … football’s coming home again”). If flags are universally signals of peremptory intent, tell that to the Russian teenager who asked all the fans he met to sign his with where they were from. Desecrating the sacred colours of the motherland with “Jeff, Grimsby” doesn’t get you put in a gulag, apparently.And if this all sounds too magical to be true, that’s how it felt. When numerous Russians asked why we were being told not to come to their country – once phrasing it heartbreakingly as, “Why don’t you like us?” – I initially worried it was some sort of state edict that Putin had issued into their mind-chips to trick us. But it quickly became obvious that it was I, plagued with worries of being attacked if I donned an England shirt, who had been operating in a fantasy of disinformation. My first Airbnb host said how happy he was to meet an Englishman, as his favourite author was Stephen Fry and described how he’d very much enjoyed the BBC adaptation of War and Peace, and that Russians felt a great affinity for the British as they also had a great empire in the past but are now far less powerful and in somewhat of an identity crisis in the present. I tried to return the compliment but am so poorly read I settled for saying it was great when Andrei Arshavin scored four goals for Arsenal at Anfield.Yes, there are clearly problems in Russia with racism, homophobia and hooliganism that as a straight, white man weren’t likely to impact my trip. For a country avowedly impressed with the British culture of 30 years ago, one wonders where the Russians got such ideas. But those issues seemed as irrelevant to this World Cup as Britain’s plundering of Iraq’s oil or the troubling treatment of migrants were from the 2012 Olympics. The experience of being a football fan in Russia, not just for me but for the Senegalese, Nigerians, Panamanians and BAME people I was tolerating Fifa’s godless fan-parks with, was so surprising and thrilling as to be soul-enriching.Huge congratulations must go to the law enforcement that’s been put in place to stop both the most fighty Russians and the most fighty English from making their presence felt. But those responsible for the headlines with TOO MANY CAPITAL LETTERS should be ashamed. Not just for denying England fans these experiences, but for allowing the Russian people to feel demonised, and indeed for allowing Putin to capitalise on this othering of the Russian people to support his us-against-them narrative. Every English person that has a positive interaction with a Russian person is a step further away from letting the people in power turn us against each other ... is what I drunkenly mumbled into Anastasia’s ear a few minutes before I learned she had a husband, and a few minutes after she’d said there are no good computer hackers in Russia, and about 20 minutes after I’d been singing “Football’s coming home”. We’re all living in our own fantasies I suppose.* Allegedly.

But she should heed the warnings of Leona Lewis and Jedward …O31 won’t be the first film Dani Dyer has appeared in – she has previously been seen in fare like Age of Kill, We Still Kill the Old Way and Bonded by Blood 2 – but it will be the first film she’ll make as a newly minted Love Island star. By the time O31 comes out, she will be legitimately famous. Or at least, as legitimately famous as an ITV2 reality show contestant can be once the afterglow of Love Island has faded. Will anybody watch it? That’s harder to say. Dyer will play a woman who realises her brother killed her mum. According to its writer, O31 deals with: “race, politics, religion, homosexuality and how these are seen in society.” It doesn’t sound like a fun time.By all accounts, Dyer is in a tricky situation. Thanks to Love Island, she is more visible than she has ever been. But, thanks to Love Island, she’s going to have to work 10 times harder than every other actor if she wants to be taken seriously. Love Island is going to warp and taint her career for years. If she isn’t careful, all her roles will feel like stunt casting, trading off a quickly decaying moment of notoriety.When stars of reality shows make films, it is almost always a disaster. There is a reason why From Justin to Kelly (2003) is often singled out as the worst film ever made: it’s because it’s the worst film ever made a miscalculated attempt to leverage the winner and runner-up of the first American Idol series into something resembling a film career. Neither Kelly Clarkson nor Justin Guarini were actors. They had no chemistry. They could barely read lines. The film was a terrible, soulless contractual obligation for all involved. It contained a song entitled Chick-Seeking Missile but isn’t nearly as fun as that makes it sound.And From Justin to Kelly is only the tip of the iceberg. In 2014, X Factor winner Leona Lewis featured in Walking on Sunshine, a miserable little jukebox musical that made Mamma Mia! look like Tarkovsky. Jedward’s foray into cinema currently consists of three Sharknado movies and Keith Lemon: The Film. Despite studying at the Lee Strasberg Institute, Caggie Dunlop from Made in Chelsea has only managed a bit-part role – someone called Poodle – in a largely unseen film called The Hand of the Creator. Even Paris Hilton, at the height of her reality show infamy, could only scale the questionable heights of The Hottie and the Nottie, a real film that people actually paid money to make.Then there’s the example that Dyer will know most intimately. 2012’s Run for Your Wife was packed to the gills with non-actors, from Sarah Harding as a lead to cameos by everyone from Noel Edmonds to Rolf Harris, and it has comprehensively been called the worst British film of all time. She’d know, because she’s in it too, albeit in a minor supporting role.However, there are exceptions. Emma Stone, for example, got her first big break on a 2005 reality show called In Search of the Partridge Family – which aimed to cast the pilot for a remake of the beloved 1970s sitcom – and she went on to win an Oscar.So it can be done. Dyer should take comfort from this. If she works hard and makes sensible choices, she too can outpace the toxic orbit of reality television. Plus, she’s already made Run for Your Wife, so it’s not like her career can get any worse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f61f631addfd3dd76af302f23135f0ab80ddd89c/0_103_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1994610407ad662aca95f241a43d62d0","title":"sorry to bother you movie boots riley interview","story":"In his genre-defying directorial debut, Sorry to Bother You, the rapper and producer is bringing radicalism to the big screen, whether the industry is ready for him or notBoots Riley doesn’t do soundbites. He speaks in dense, meaty paragraphs full of ideas that, in the course of explicating themselves, branch out into sub-ideas which then branch out into sub-sub-ideas. In dealing with such an interview subject, a reporter will sometimes follow a long response by restating the gist of what’s been said, looking for confirmation that everyone’s on the same page. When I take this tack – suggesting that his 2012 album and newly released feature film, both titled Sorry to Bother You, offer two perspectives on a single story – he rebuffs me.“I mean, that makes for a cute, concise kind of slogan,” he concedes, during a candid interview outside of a screening room in New York’s posh Tribeca neighborhood. “I wish I was that type of person, who was better at marketing. But I don’t like that that’s actually not how I think of it.” He goes on to explain that while the two works draw influence from the same set of themes, neither was intended as an adaptation of the other. He will not be mistaken.Just as his work defies easy classification, so too does Riley himself refuse to be placed in a tidy media narrative. He’s a dedicated radical with the street cred to prove it, a wicked humorist oscillating between surreal satire and gallows slapstick, a rapper alone in a genre he created, an authority on class theory who loves to party, and now, a film-maker wending his way through an industry he doesn’t quite consider hostile territory, but doesn’t trust, either. Messy as the task might be, we’re all going to have to figure out what to make of Riley, because he doesn’t intend on going anywhere any time soon.At age 47, two and a half decades out from the release of his first album as ringleader of the Oakland hip-hop collective the Coup, Riley has steered his career closer to the mainstream than ever without compromising his deeply held political convictions. No easy feat, as shown in Sorry to Bother You, his debut as director. The film is an incendiary look at the trials and tribulations black men face in an economy exploiting and demeaning them before casting them aside. Riley transmuted his own frustrations from dealings with record label suits into a fairytale nightmare of late capitalism: Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield), a telemarketer, finds that his commissions soar when he puts on his “white voice” and tumbles into a corporate behemoth with darker intentions even beyond their stated mission of sanitized slavery. With ribald humor and outrageous provocations – there’s a nearly nude recitation from the Berry Gordy-produced film The Last Dragon, and a number of jokes revolve around a specific aspect of a specific animal’s anatomy – Riley has cloaked a subversive anti-establishment screed in allegory.“Science fiction is where a lot of radical writers go to hide,” Riley explains, “because you can conceal your ideas in metaphor, sometimes to the point where it doesn’t matter at all. If metaphor is so much that that’s all there is … OK, so originally, George Lucas was going to follow American Graffiti with Apocalypse Now, but his version was going to frame the Viet Cong as the protagonists. We follow them as they go into the US-occupied territory and encounter their Kurtz. But he couldn’t get it funded, and his budget was way, way lower than Coppola’s ended up being. So he said, ‘How about we put it in space?’ And so Star Wars was born. The most popular piece of pop culture after the Bible was written against American imperialism, and nobody gets that.”Riley has spared no effort to ensure that his call to arms doesn’t get drowned out by the peals of laughter. Steeped as the film is in an antic sensibility, the themes of oppression and organized resistance aren’t shuffled off to the subtext. Cassius bears witness to the insidious process by which institutions nudge the unthinkable into the realm of acceptability bit by bit, and joins a rebel faction putting Riley’s fiery ideologies into practice.“I’ve done a lot of fighting to stay in Oakland, with my music,” Riley is proud to say. “At different times in my career, people are like: ‘You should really go to LA, because that’s where you can have this meeting and that meeting …’ But I also wanted to stay in Oakland, because to me, it afforded me more power. The power to be part of organizing campaigns, the power of knowing people and being known by my people. Someone says, ‘You need your car fixed,’ I know the guy. I think that helps for an artist to know their community. I fought for myself to stay there. I should’ve fought harder for everyone to stay there. I should’ve been part of a campaign for rent control and higher wages.”A seriousness and concentration creep over Riley’s face when the conversation turns to his hometown, which also provides Sorry to Bother You with its vibrant setting. He’s fiercely defensive of Oakland – he has to be, as the city’s integrity and culture have recently come under attack from developers and other agents of gentrification. The Silicon Valley boom that cannibalized San Francisco has spread its plague across the Bay to drive up the cost of living and put neighborhood spots out of business.Riley breaks it down: “For me, the version of the southern plantation-style mansions that we have in Oakland, as far as the wealth is concerned, they’re a little hipper. The style is sometimes self-deprecating as part of its hipness. The style tries to be really basic, recall the time when someone could order a 25-cent cup of coffee. I find it kitschy, the whole PBR thing. But for me, gentrification isn’t about what kind of people are moving in, it’s about the people who are forced out. Go around Oakland, and parts of it are a fancy ghost town. Places where friends used to live, you see reminders of what was once there. It’s like the ghost town from Martian Chronicles. You can tell something’s going on.”Principled, outspoken, and partisan, Riley doesn’t act like the kind of person who’d make a go of it in showbiz. The nature of the movie industry is such that finagling any sizable amount of money means getting in bed with a company owned by a gargantuan media conglomerate, but Riley found an open-minded collaborator in Megan Ellison and her Annapurna Pictures distributor. They presented a happy medium, just big enough to give Riley the nationwide rollout he felt his picture deserved, and not so big that suits would start clucking over content biting the hand that feeds. Still, he held on to a healthy cynicism:“Annapurna is, genuinely, some of the coolest people in Hollywood … but the whole indie capitalists versus big capitalists thing, that preference comes from a lack of class analysis,” he states. “There are practical things that happen when someone’s independent, they can make the choices they want to make. You don’t need a meeting of 200 people that ends with everyone finding something they least disagree with. But, still – it’s like this: I’d rather have the local IPA, because it tastes better, but it’s not ethically superior.”Cinema – the largest, most money-reliant sector of the entertainment world – hasn’t historically been kind to dissenters. (As the old wisdom goes, if you want to send a message, try Western Union.) Riley has arrived at a career juncture in which, for the like-minded rabble-rousers that came before him, left only the options to sell out or give in to obscurity. But the fury of Sorry to Bother You has struck a chord with a furious nation, as luminaries from the music and film communities have lined up to sing Riley’s praises while black test audiences cheer in cathartic release. Riley’s insistence on being Riley, whoever that might be, paid off instead of angling towards palatability or chasing trends, he’s reshaping the business in his own image.“Soon, in about six months, you’ll start to see the Sorry to Bother You-style movies, except with dinosaurs and the Rock,” he deadpans. He doesn’t sound all that pleased about it, however, and why should he be? He’s currently promoting a film about the ruthless efficiency with which white industries dilute, reproduce, and commodify black excellence. In the same hot seat as Cassius Green, Riley has concluded that for both himself and the culture at large, the only path to progress is by keeping it real – that is to say, by inciting action in our own communities on a realistic scale. Ever the enigma, Riley reveals one last contradiction with his parting words: that a jaded man can still feel firmly, earnestly hopeful.“There are movements happening that aren’t just online: Black Lives Matter, and before that we had Occupy. Even in the cold, marketing-minded sense of ‘What are people into right now?’ it’s all making us feel a little more free … If we want more radical movies, we’ve got to first have more radical movement out in the world. That’s where it starts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/261129f451ef7558ba4788aff96e148eeec56cfc/4_30_2586_1552/master/2586.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20a5c6902d7aa29d01d7d24b89628d3","title":"gareth southgate england avoid traps colombia","story":"Manager understands the increased excitement back home but says his players should not get carried away by emotionOverall there must have been half a dozen occasions when Gareth Southgate was asked whether he could understand the common perception that England had suddenly found themselves in a position whereby they might have a considerably better chance to reach a World Cup final than many people could have anticipated at the start of this competition.Southgate chose his words carefully to make sure he could not be accused of sounding presumptuous or, worse, of saying anything that might inadvertently end up being part of José Pekerman’s team-talk for Colombia.He made the point that Marcus Rashford was eight years old on the last occasion England won a knockout tie in a World Cup – or any major tournament – and everyone knew why he was saying it.Southgate’s only lapse came when he talked about Tuesday’s encounter being England’s “biggest game for 10 years”. He meant 12 years because, at the risk of being pedantic, England did not qualify for Euro 2008. But yes, it is the biggest game since England played Portugal in the 2006 World Cup, featuring a red card for Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo’s infamous wink and yet more evidence that England are not made for penalty shootouts.Southgate prefers to speak in plain English, not clichés, so he refrained from using the age-old phrase about “taking each game as it comes”. That, however, was the gist of it. Very sensible, too, when history suggests England should not get too far ahead of themselves. Reminder: there were members of Roy Hodgson’s staff punching the air when Iceland scored the last-minute winner against Austria that meant they would be England’s first knockout opponents in Euro 2016.Southgate did acknowledge that England had found themselves in the better half of the draw, with the possibility of a quarter-final against Sweden or Switzerland to follow and, beyond that, a semi-final against Russia or Croatia and no way of meeting France or Brazil until the final.England’s base in the pine forests of Repino may be secluded but Southgate is in enough contact with the wider world to understand that the fervour is building back home. “I am not surprised,” he said. “Whenever people say ‘I don’t care about international football’ that tends to be during the season. Then you come to a big tournament and it is not just football fans, it is grandads, it is aunts, everyone, supporting the team. And, for some reason, they like these lads.”His bigger point was that this was not a time to think of any other match apart from the next one. “That was a trap we’ve fallen into in the past,” he said. “I can see everybody is more excited but we have to think separately, otherwise we just get carried away on the wave of emotion and we would not be thinking clearly about what we have to affect. We have to control the bits we have to control. But we would be foolish to focus on longer into the tournament.”Again it came back to the Iceland game and the mistake many people made of assuming England were set for a quarter-final against France in Paris. Hodgson and his assistant, Ray Lewington, did not even bother going to the Iceland-Austria game to make a personal check their next opponents, preferring instead to spend the day sightseeing and going on a boat journey down the river Seine. Even now, two years on, it seems like a remarkable oversight and listening to Southgate it was clear he felt the attitude of the players was wrong, too.“A few of these players, in the last championships, were in a fixture they thought they should win. Then, once they went behind, they suddenly felt that approach wasn’t correct. We won’t fall into that trap again, against a really good team. It is one of many games that we have unpicked because it would be silly not to look at previous tournaments and try to identify what we can learn.”Not to be too presumptuous, for starters. Colombia, after all, are hardly a team that England can underestimate, particularly if James Rodríguez is fit to take his place in a forward line with Radamel Falcao and Juan Cuadrado. England have not kept a clean sheet here and, if they are to make it into the final eight, a lot depends on the three-man backline of Kyle Walker, John Stones and Harry Maguire, how well Jordan Henderson can shield them as the only defensive midfielder and whether Jordan Pickford can look more assured in goal.At the same time England have Southgate’s first-choice XI available, with Fabian Delph the only absentee now he has flown home to attend the birth of his child – or, as Southgate put it, “buying his wife curries and all sorts of other strange things”. Southgate is encouraged by the energy of his team’s performances and did not seem too troubled when it was pointed out to him that it will be 999 days since Raheem Sterling, with two England goals in 40 appearances, last scored for his country.“We have a very difficult opponent – a very good side who we respect –and the level of the game is going up a notch,” Southgate said. “But we think we can cause opposing teams a lot of problems and that won’t change because we are in the knockout phase. We will continue to play in the style we have.“I want the players, more than anything, to continue to attack the tournament as we have. That shouldn’t change in the knockout stage and, if anything, we should feel freer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855d87d1247e48397d83af59560369d828b2f7f6/92_286_4556_2734/master/4556.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76f7ab6774502dfe13d8f69529a8d1f1","title":"gareth southgate england colombia knockout world cup last 16","story":"Gareth Southgate has urged his players to “write their own stories” by steering England to a first knockout win at the World Cup in 12 years as his team seek to get past Colombia at Spartak Stadium and into the quarter‑finals.The national manager is acutely aware of England’s wretched record in knockout ties in the World Cup, with only Denmark and Ecuador having been beaten since Bobby Robson’s side reached the last four in 1990. Yet rather than consider that dismal record as a burden, or be tempted into looking at an apparently favourable draw that would take England deep into the tournament, the hope is that this young side will be spurred by the chance to eclipse the achievements of previous, more experienced teams.Southgate has described the game with Colombia, ranked four places below England, as the nation’s “biggest game for a decade”.He added: “The point I was making was it’s been over 10 years since we won a knockout fixture. For this team, it’s a brilliant opportunity to go beyond where more experienced teams have gone before. They’re relishing that chance. We’re viewing the game as one with an opponent we really respect. They’ve got really good players and will have lots of supporters in the stadium. I went to two of their matches in Brazil and it was a real carnival atmosphere.“We have to concentrate on our own football, playing in the style we have throughout the tournament, and playing with the same mentality. We have to show the resilience and the freedom we’ve played with up to this point. I want the players to continue to attack the tournament as we have.\u0026nbspThat shouldn’t change in the knockout\u0026nbspstage. We should\u0026nbspfeel freer, if anything, because these are the sort of matches you want to be involved in. The lads have the chance to write their own stories now.”England are expected to revert to the team who defeated Tunisia in their opening Group G game, with Dele Alli fit after missing the past two games with a thigh strain. Harry Kane, one of eight rested against Belgium, will return to captain the side and will aim to maintain his staggering scoring record wearing the armband, with manager and players alike anxious to avoid being distracted by what could lie ahead after the last 16. Finishing second in their section appears to have opened a more straightforward passage to the semi-finals, but Colombia, who will check on the fitness of James Rodríguez late-on, represent distinctly awkward opposition.England’s survivors in the England squad from Euro 2016 can recall the humiliation suffered against Iceland. Southgate implied the team’s approach in Nice may have been undermined by complacency, with thoughts drifting to a potential quarter-final against France in Paris, and stressed his team would not “fall into that trap again”. The focus is on Colombia alone.“We focus on the match, on our own performance, and everything will fall into place from there,” Southgate said. “Maybe the teams who aren’t here weren’t as strong this time. That means the ones left have hit a level of performance that’s very high. If teams knock out the likes of Germany and Spain, then they have to be respected. We feel we’re one of those countries with players coming through, but we haven’t discussed anything beyond Colombia.“We’re always trying to prepare the team psychologically, get them in the right mindset for every game, if they need a push or to be calmed down, whatever it might be. That’s the art of coaching. That’s what our staff are there to do. What we sense in the group is an excitement an understanding that it’s pointless looking beyond this match and that was a trap we’ve fallen into in the past. You can see how tight all the knockout matches are.“If you’d asked me a couple of months ago whether I knew exactly what to expect from my team, I’d have been a bit more uncertain. But the more we work with this group of players, the more consistent their performance is. We are a young side, the least experienced in the tournament, but we have some old fogeys as well who can provide the leadership. They are really hungry and want to do well … I’m confident we’ll see a really good performance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc88a1006b34330d888ddc7d0b061d368b620123/110_48_2311_1386/master/2311.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8cff15842d8a01332cf38308d86d034","title":"gareth southgate way england colombia respected","story":"“I don’t know what team can afford to rest players,” Óscar Tabárez told a room full of reporters in Samara last week, the day before Uruguay’s final World Cup group game against Russia. Tabárez’s team had already made it to the last 16 and rumours had spread there would be major changes to his starting XI.In response he fell back on a familiar phrase. “We do not speculate,” Tabárez announced. It is a distinctly Uruguayan note of defiance, a reminder that this is the most fiercely competitive of\u0026nbspfootballing nations, notorious for\u0026nbspits warrior spirit, what Jorge Valdano referred to in these pages as\u0026nbspthe “Garra Charrúa” culture, named after the native tribe which, rather than offering to negotiate, killed and ate their European\u0026nbspinvaders.Resting players, going slow, soft‑pedalling a winnable game: Tabárez and Uruguay refused to contemplate this. Russia were duly dispatched 3-0, ignition for the subsequent defeat of Portugal in the\u0026nbsplast 16. France will provide powerful over-dog opposition on Friday. But Uruguay are ticking now, fired by the thrill of competition. This is a team where nobody sleeps until this tournament is done one way or another.And so on to England and a backstory that has swirled just out of sight around the deliciously well‑matched last-16 tie against Colombia at the Spartak Stadium on Tuesday night. In Gareth we trust. For now. Depending on how things turn out. But it is hard to avoid the sense of contrast here. England, it seems, do speculate at World Cups.With Spain dumped out of the draw by Russia on Sunday afternoon Southgate’s decision not to field his most powerful team in the final Group\u0026nbspG game has begun to look an ever more wildly polarised piece of tactical thinking.So much reasoning in sport is reverse-engineered out of results, which are in turn decided on the tiniest details. History is written, in gloating 10-point headlines, by the\u0026nbspwinners.But this is what Southgate is now facing. The danger is that the effects of a calculated gamble – and probably a wrong-headed one – will\u0026nbspnow be ramped up by subsequent results.Win against Colombia and Southgate will have shuttled England towards near-certain World\u0026nbspCup glory. Lose and England’s manager will be open to accusations of having tried, unsuccessfully, to juke the draw at a tournament and fallen short of the obligation to compete to the maximum in every game, another case in sport of an obvious strength – planning, thoroughness, “owning the situation” – becoming\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspflaw.The comparison might be made with 1950, when England’s selection committee left out Stanley Matthews against the amateurs of the USA in Belo Horizonte, saving their ace for tougher challenges in the later rounds, only to find themselves guilty of the kind of starchy British post-imperial arrogance to which only a slightly wooden Hollywood re-enactment can do justice.With this in mind it is probably a good idea to pack this away now. Southgate was either right or wrong to make eight changes in\u0026nbspKaliningrad.The dumb luck of being sunk by a defensive mistake on Tuesday night, or a fine performance from an opponent, should not change this.And probably there was a slight mis-step here, albeit one made out of good intentions. Judging by Southgate’s obiter dicta at his post‑match press conference it seems England were broadly convinced that the choice for the last\u0026nbsp16 would boil down to Senegal and Colombia. Colombia are ranked 16th in the world, Senegal 27th. Strong opponents both: better to face either one with a fresher first XI.So Southgate will have chosen his team for Belgium the day before the game. The players will have been told. Overnight in Kaliningrad the skies were filled with travelling agents turning up to see their charges make their World Cup bows.Except, two hours before kick‑off things changed. Japan had finished above Senegal in Group H. Suddenly there was a genuine choice. Winning Group\u0026nbspG would dish up a tie against opponents ranked 61 in the world, below Panama. Yes, the other half of the draw already looked easier beyond that stage. But given a straight choice and no preconceptions most England managers would take the Tabárez line. We do not speculate. We play to win.Southgate chose not to strengthen his team. Elements such as loyalty and balance and happiness in the group come into this. It was a measured call. It did not work out. But it will still hover round his shoulders, a blow ready to fall should England slip up in Moscow when they might have been in Rostov playing Japan.Whereas in reality this must all be balanced against a mass of positives on the other side. The comparison with Euro 2016 has been made, when England made six changes for the final group game against Slovakia in Saint-Etienne, drew 0-0, then played against Iceland like a team recently roused from cryogenic storage.But so far it is the contrast that stands out. By the time the Iceland game came round Wayne Rooney had already leaked to the press his anger at being dropped. Senior FA figures had made clear their unhappiness with the manager, his ever more distant hopes of a new\u0026nbspcontract.Compare and contrast the complete absence of leaks or noises off from within the Harry Kane industrial complex. Kane has five goals in two games. He wanted to play against Belgium\u0026nbspB, then Japan, then have a square go at Brazil.He did not want to be rested. His agent wants him to win the Golden Boot. But there has been no suggestion of public disappointment, of anything less than a functioning team at work. This in itself is progress.Plus, there is always another side. Uruguay do not speculate. But they have arrived at the quarter-finals without Edinson Cavani, their top scorer’s hamstring twanged against Portugal after he missed only one minute of the previous three World Cup games.Meanwhile Croatia did rest players for their final group stage match but played their worst game of the tournament against Denmark off the back of it.It is surely better to judge Southgate’s progress on more tangible evidence. And not on the whims, the fury, the fine details of Colombia in Moscow, a game that deserves to stand alone, and to be played out without looking back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad1d3ed25c29f3523f2012d754f6d3753d55bc24/0_39_2057_1234/master/2057.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c96ae8dc6b67bd9093899e7da6bba5e","title":"marouane fellaini nacer chadli fringes belgium hazard flatters","story":"Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli play bit-part roles at their clubs but proved their worth with goals to beat JapanHearts sank like lost shoes in a muddy field in Manchester when the news emerged last week. Derision, resignation, bafflement: United had a perfect opportunity to rid themselves of Marouane Fellaini but instead they gave him a new contract.If one listened to some of the wailing, it felt as if Fellaini was an irritating house guest, the sort who puts his shoes on the couch and takes bites out of the cheese. The time had come for him to move on but United not only invited him back in for a brew, they made him up a proper bed in the spare room.And then there is Nacer Chadli. It was, to say the least, an eyebrow‑raiser when he was even named in the Belgium squad for Russia: one had to look up where he was playing his club football and, as it turns out, it was still West Brom. Not that he had actually played much: he had spent virtually the whole season out injured, making his call-up even more baffling. This was not Brazil fretting on Neymar’s fitness: this was Nacer Chadli.And yet these two unwanted toys, discarded in the minds of many, were the men who saved Belgium. One could almost hear the snorts when they were introduced, proof that Roberto Martínez was a smooth‑talking snake-oil salesman, not a manager but a motivational speaker with some coaching badges. Fellaini and Chadli? Pah!Shows what we know. Or, it shows that football generally, and this World Cup specifically, is absolute chaos. Nothing can be predicted. Nothing can be planned for.This is a tournament where Russia look like potential champions and Germany are sulking at home for the first time since before the war. A tournament where Thomas Müller and Andrés Iniesta have been virtual irrelevances but Fellaini and Chadli are game-changers.Before the game the talk was about a more conventionally desirable player. On Sunday Eden Hazard was asked about the departure from the tournament of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and what that might mean to him.It was framed as creating a vacancy for a tournament-defining star, a chance for Hazard to translate his frequent brilliance for Chelsea on to the international stage. “It’s time to shine,” he said, with a sort of dead-eyed certainty.He started as if that was his big aim, the juices flowing from the off. There was a driving run through the middle, a delicate flick with his right foot, a finger‑stinging shot with his left. He seemed more aggressive than usual: not in the tackle but in his movements. Fine skill combined with a point to prove.But as the game progressed he faded, though he did hit a post after Japan’s first goal. He might take it as an insult that Martínez went for the hammer and smashed the emergency glass, reaching for the sinewy tree that goes by the name Fellaini. Insult it might be, but it worked.Perhaps, if nothing else, this game might provide some succour to despairing United fans. Really, they should know what Fellaini is there for by now. He is an impact substitute, a creator of chaos to turn to when order and sound planning have not worked.Assuming he is used in these sorts of circumstance, as the plan\u0026nbspB muscle, he is a perfectly fine option – effective, ugly, not capable of elite football, not capable of much that is recognised as football at all, really, and yet someone who can change matches.Which is what he did here. Japan almost looked cocky in the minutes after they scored their second through Takashi Inui and then, when Fellaini and Chadli were introduced, it was as if they looked to the sidelines and thought: “Is that all they’ve got? This is in the bag, lads.”Well, it was not in the bag. It was very much out of the bag. Thanks to Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli, Belgium’s golden generation live to fight another day. What a world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f8435ce52bdcdb050452cdcaf1e17a17d5aa42b/0_146_4632_2779/master/4632.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5122fc23aac707ac86811b723d6d7587","title":"colombia fans world cup london elephant castle","story":"Events in Russia are followed closely in Elephant and Castle as tournament helps take minds off regeneration uncertaintyWorld Cup fever may slowly be gripping England supporters as Gareth Southgate’s side prepare to face Colombia in the last 16 but there is one corner of south London that will be fully behind the South Americans on Tuesday evening.Elephant and Castle has been at the centre of a thriving Colombian community ever since a large wave of immigration in the early 1980s as families attempted to escape conflict at home. A steady stream of students and families since then means there are estimated to be more than 40,000 Colombians living in the United Kingdom. The majority are based in the capital, with a large community also north of the river around Seven Sisters.Yet with several restaurants and bars including La Bodeguita – opened 12 years ago by Cali-born Diana Sach – situated around the much maligned shopping centre that was built in the 1960s, there is no doubt that “the Elephant” will be the place to watch the drama from Moscow unfold.“I will be getting here at 4.30 to make sure I can get a table,” says Pablo, a Colombian who moved to London in the 1970s. “We are all friends who have been coming for years. Many Colombian people live in different parts of London but like to come here because it is very exciting. It’s very important for the community.”Sach, having initially opened a kiosk selling traditional Colombian food in 1998, took the plunge when an Italian restaurant in the shopping centre vacated its premises and she and her two brothers moved in.“We were here 24 hours a day at the beginning and it was very hard work,” she says. “But it was great as we saw it gaining popularity. People now come from all over – if they have anything to celebrate, they come to us.”Recent regeneration of the area has resulted in plans to demolish the shopping centre, regularly described as one of London’s ugliest buildings, and there are fears that some independent businesses in the area could be forced out because of rising rents. The demolition has been delayed until 2019 but, despite the best efforts of Latin Elephant – a charity fighting on behalf of local traders – Sach admits she remains concerned over the future for her and the rest of the community.“We don’t know what is going to happen yet but we do know we want to carry on running a restaurant in Elephant and Castle,” she says. “La Bodeguita is my life but it is also a big part of so many other people’s lives here too.” visited La Bodeguita for Uruguay’s victory over Portugal in the last 16 on Saturday and there was no doubt whom patrons were supporting. Both of Edinson Cavani’s goals were greeted with loud cheers from supporters from Peru, Ecuador, Chile and, of course, Colombia. Around 400 are expected for Tuesday’s match, with confidence clearly running high after José Pekerman’s side recovered from losing their opening game to Japan.“I’m pretty sure we will win – we have a better team than England,” says Raul Alzate, who has lived in London for 25 years and whose nephew Steven Alzate plays for Brighton’s under-23s. “We’ve been in this country for a very long time, so I’m a bit torn actually. We usually support England as well! This time I have to support Colombia. It’s in my blood.”Much has been made of Southgate’s decision to field a weakened team in England’s final group stage match, with the defeat against Belgium ensuring they are now on the so-called “easier” side of the draw. They are third favourites with some bookmakers for the tournament after the elimination of Germany, Spain, Portugal and Argentina, although Raul insists Colombia will be no pushovers.“I can see it being a really good game,” he says. “But if England give them time on the ball, then they are in big trouble.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37bd732d817fb0a424dd2200a74f165a6047a879/0_117_3499_2100/master/3499.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5688977983f5b9af7b45393f0f57ad8b","title":"lyon ada hegerberg ronaldo champions league goals","story":"The forward, still only 22, has proved a big success in France but has grown so disillusioned with women’s football in her homeland she has turned her back on the national teamWhen Lyon’s Ada Hegerberg finished the season with a third consecutive Champions League winner’s medal she threw down the gauntlet, tweeting: “Hey @Cristiano can you score one more tomorrow?” As she latched on to a Shanice van de Sanden cross, scoring her side’s third as they defeated an exhausted Wolfsburg 4-1 in extra time, she matched Cristiano Ronaldo’s 15-goal haul for the 2017-18 campaign.In doing so Hegerberg beat her previous 14-goal tally to secure the record for the most goals in a Women’s Champions League season. “It was an ambition for me at the start of the season,” she says. “My preparation had gone well. I was in good shape. The team was in good shape.”“A lot of people talk about records but you can get lost as a player if you think too much about them. I think more about preparation than numbers. If I’m well prepared, there will be results. So I try to kick ass and work hard in the moment and I know the record will come.”The Norwegian closed her record-breaking campaign by committing her future to Lyon, signing a new three-year contract (an unprecedented length in the women’s game) which keeps her in France until 2021.“You can only have a short sight because things change a lot,” she said. “You can’t plan what the years will bring. But right now Lyon is the best club in the world, where I can get the best out of myself and become the best, so for me it was not a difficult choice. I always try to live in the present and take everything day by day to become a better version of myself. Lyon is where I’m able to do that and signing for another three years just made sense.”Life with the French and European champions feels an age away from when her goalscoring prowess first began to turn heads in Norway. “I started at maybe seven years old but I really got into it at 10, maybe 11.The Hegerberg sisters both joined the Toppserien side Kolbotn and in August 2011 Ada Hegerberg became the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the league’s history, aged 16, and finished the league’s top scorer. The pair then joined Stabaek where Ada again finished top scorer with 25 goals in 18 games.Recognised as two of the best talents in Norwegian football, the sisters chose to move to the German side Turbine Potsdam when the opportunity arose and Hegerberg is increasingly dismayed at the future of women’s football in her home country: “Football is the biggest sport in Norway for girls and has been for years but at the same time girls don’t have the same opportunities as the boys. Norway has a great history of women’s football but it’s harder now,” she said. “We’ve stopped talking about development and other countries have overtaken us.”Lyon, she says, made their move for her in the summer of 2014. “The best club called me and wanted to know if I wanted to go there and play and I was like: ‘Yeah, I’m totally doing this.’ The best players were there, I thought it was a dream. I knew it would be tough to get a spot in the team but I knew I had to trust in my own qualities and go for it.”In 2016 the poster girl of Norwegian football picked up Uefa’s Best Women’s Player award as Lyon won the treble, following it with BBC Women’s Footballer of the Year in 2017, while her longstanding frustrations over the state of women’s football both domestically in Norway and with the national team led to an announcement that she would be stepping back from the latter after the country’s Euro 2017 exit.With no sign of an end to the impasse, one of the world’s best could disappointingly be missing from next summer’s World Cup in France. Yet, since taking the decision and focusing on her club football with Lyon, she seems to those watching to be happier on the pitch, as if lifting the weight of international pressure, expectation and frustration at the system has freed her just to enjoy playing and to find a home in France.With over 250 career goals and three Champions League, Division 1 Féminine and Coupe de France titles to her name, it is easy to forget Hegerberg is still only 22.So what does a player who has achieved so much and with years of football ahead of her do to stay focused? “My ambitions are all about improvement. Every year I analyse the previous season with those closest to me Thomas my fiancé, my sister and my parents.“That’s how I find out which areas I have to keep on improving and areas where I have to consolidate,” she says.Getting space from football is also important: “I live in a really beautiful city and try to relax as much as possible when I don’t train. When we’re not with the team I train a lot on my own. Every day I need to have some distance from football. I read a lot. I don’t study, so I read everything novels, biographies, anything really.“This is how I think. It’s a lot about the mental side. During summer training with my sister Andrine and my dad I’m very concerned about results that build high self-confidence and wellbeing. My philosophy is that you have to build stone on stone and, when you reach a high level, you have to work to stay there.”• Newport County will host the crunch Women’s World Cup qualifier between Wales and England on 31 August.

The result: successive second-round exits in South Africa and Brazil. Since his appointment in late 2015, Juan Carlos Osorio has presided over an exceptional period of stability and progress for El Tri. From the beginning he pledged to do things differently. Gone were the melodrama, nostalgia and hyperventilation traditionally associated with management of the Mexican national team in their place Osorio, erudite and understated, offered innovation, meticulous preparation and a tactical flexibility that stayed true to Mexico’s tradition of musketeering football. The early results were promising. There was a long unbeaten streak in Osorio’s first six months in the job, as well as a semi-final appearance at last year’s Confederations Cup, and qualification for this World Cup – in a Hexagonal which the US men’s national team did everything in its power to turn into an effective Pentagonal – never looked in doubt. Planning for Russia was typically meticulous, involving cutting-edge sleep science, the assistance of a team psychologist, special mattresses, and a culinary regime built on the fortifying power of cherry juice and “tortillas that taste like glory”. The result: for the seventh World Cup in a row, Mexico have departed at the round of 16. Neither the chaos of the pre-Osorio era nor the stability that’s followed has allowed the Mexicans to break the fabled curse of el quinto partido. The quest for El Tri to carry a World Cup campaign into a fifth match continues.This was, on paper at least, the strongest Mexico squad in years, perhaps ever, built around a spine of players – Guillermo Ochoa in goal, Hugo Ayala and Miguel Layun at the back, midfielder Andres Guardado, and the attacking duo of Javier Hernandez and Carlos Vela – who had all come up with the all-conquering under-17 side that won the 2005 world championship and were now in the prime of their careers.Hirving “Chucky” Lozano promised youthful zest and unpredictability going forward, and for those who’d taken note of the young winger’s 17 goals for PSV Eindhoven last season, it was no surprise to see him brutalise Germany in El Tri’s opening match of this tournament. Lozano, all tireless running and lethal finishing, embodied the new hope of this Mexican side. It wasn’t simply Mexico’s commitment to attack at all costs that so impressed, it was the belief that seemed to consume the players as they flooded forward against a listless, uncommitted German defence: the belief that finally, after decades languishing in the middle of the food chain, they had the raw talent to take down the big beasts. Here, surely, was atonement for the humiliation of a 7-0 defeat to Chile in the quarter-finals of the 2016 Copa America. Here was vindication of all the tinkering Osorio had done in the buildup to the tournament, a vital riposte to the #FueraOsorio (“Fire Osorio”) hashtag haters on social media. Here was an upset to rank alongside Senegal v France in 2002 or the Netherlands’ scalping of imperial Spain four years ago. Here was proof that Mexico had arrived.A comfortable victory against South Korea was enough to see Mexico’s many travelling fans abandon cries of #FueraOsorio in favor of a serenade, set to the tune of the ubiquitous Seven Nation Army, of “el profe Osorio”. A point against a rugged but unadventurous Swedish side in the final group match promised to be enough for El Tri to progress to the round of 16, and then: then Osorio froze. The great tinkerman, perhaps over-enthused by the waves of fan-love suddenly coursing his way, abandoned the instincts of a lifetime and sent out exactly the same starting XI to face Sweden as had overcome South Korea. It was to prove a calamitous mistake. The Mexicans seemed unsettled by the aerial threat and sheer size of the Swedes, but had few avenues to vary their approach. In the event, Korea’s miraculous defeat of Germany meant El Tri progressed regardless, but Osorio described the chastening 3-0 loss as an educational experience. “My sin was to be a purist, to think we can compete and beat a team who play the same type of football every weekend,” he said afterwards. “Hopefully one day I will get it right, that we play good football and can beat teams who play that way. This match has taught me a lot.” A key part of the legend of Mexico’s World Cup curse is the quality of the opponents that have knocked El Tri out: Hristo Stoichkov’s Bulgaria in 1994, Germany in 1998, Argentina in 2006 and again in 2010, the Netherlands four years ago and Brazil in Russia. Of all the curse years it’s only against the US, in 2002, that El Tri have faced anything less than top-tier opposition in the round of 16. The match against Sweden offered a path to top the group and avoid Brazil in the second round. Mexico’s failure to get anything out of the Sweden match was, in retrospect, the undoing of their 2018 World Cup campaign.If that defeat did teach Osorio a lot, we will have to wait to discover exactly what the lessons were. In Brazil Mexico faced an opponent much more suited to their style of play than the Swedes, but for all their dominance of possession and territory in the first-half they lacked a cutting edge in front of goal. Time and time again, pressing high and turning the ball quickly from defence into attack, they got players into good spaces but were excessively deliberate with the final ball. Time and time again, Casemiro and Paulinho broke up El Tri’s forward raids before the Brazilian back four needed to step in. The Mexicans were turned away from the nightclub before they even made it to the bouncer. Two goals against a visibly tiring Mexican defence were enough to make Brazil’s eventual triumph relatively comfortable.Osorio made much in the post-match press conference of Neymar’s time-wasting theatrics in the second half, and it is to the Mexicans’ credit that their performance at this World Cup has been blessedly free of cynicism and gamesmanship. On the other hand, Osorio’s indignant reaction points to a softness in the Mexican game, an essential naivety which was a leading cause of their failure, once again, to progress beyond the round of 16. The decision to include 39-year-old Rafael Marquez, appearing in his fifth World Cup, in the starting XI against Brazil seemed emblematic of this muddled approach: at once oddly nostalgic and one match too late. The moment the Mexicans would have benefited most from the presence of a savvy, hard-tackling veteran at the base of their midfield was in the game against Sweden. Instead Osorio started Marquez against Brazil, when Mexico required maximum speed and maximum stamina to sustain their high press and lightning counter-attacks: two qualities Marquez has never had and certainly doesn’t have now, as he ticks over into his fifth decade. The veteran midfielder was predictably anonymous and off the pace it was no surprise when Osorio took him off at half time. Osorio’s real failing in this World Cup was to not tinker when he should have (against Sweden) and tinker when he would have been better to leave things alone. In the moments of truth, Mexico – both players and manager – failed to hold their nerve. Osorio, who is regularly linked with the vacancy at the helm of the US men’s national team, has said he will take his time before deciding whether to accept the Mexican federation’s offer of a contract extension. Layun, Guardado, Hernandez and Vela will all be well into their 30s if Mexico get to Qatar, but in Lozano, Carlos Salcedo, Edson Alvarez and Jesus Gallardo, El Tri have a core to build on for the future. It’s tempting, given everything that unfolded subsequently, to see Mexico’s opening victory over the world champions as less a tale of Mexican success than German defeat to recast El Tri as the simple beneficiaries of the world champions’ complacency. That would be unfair to Mexico, who played in that match with a lack of inhibition that seemed utterly joyous and in a way almost pure, the transitions from defence to attack unfolding with elastic, instinctive ease: for 90 magical minutes, Mexico were the Platonic ideal of schoolyard football. That match was more than the start of Germany’s death roll it was a glimpse of the team Mexico wants to be: impish, quicksilver, scheming and direct. For that spectacle alone this side will be remembered fondly. Mexico’s misfortune in this tournament is that they peaked at the first obstacle, and spent the next two weeks trying to recapture that early magic. The only consolation is that, given their status as perennial qualifiers, they will almost certainly have the chance to resume the quest for el quinto partido four years from now. Neutrals will be hoping they arrive in Qatar with grit to accompany their proven polish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c1ae21b4c255a777bec4b56fc26f651c3b2ee99/0_234_4019_2412/master/4019.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcb7ff5482e5743c8ffa756ba1d5ebe4","title":"world cup 2018 england v colombia switzerland v sweden buildup live","story":"Bit worrying that the sports news channel with the yellow ticker have a penalties package on heavy rotation.

Back to real football, and the thrilling news for all Arsenal fans around the world that Calum Chambers has signed an extended contract. Oh...but what’s this...looks like Riyad Mahrez is off to Manchester City. (There’s only ten games of the World Cup left before football news becomes like this for the next two years.)Don’t take away our breakaways. After Nacer Chadli’s goal last night, Alex Hess has got his time machine on the go. The World Cup sack race continues, after Spain started it before the start of the tournament. Poland coach Adam Nawalka will not have his contract extended after failing to advance from the group phase.Zbigniew Boniek, head of the Polish FA, said Nawalka will stay in the job only until July 30. He has coached Poland since November 2013 and at Euro 2016 had looked to have the beginnings of a decent side. The England team have arrived at their hotel. As they walk in, their phones and headphones are seeing heavy use, aside from Jordan Pickford, who strolled in, bold as brass, not even on his phone or listening to the hit parade or the “In Our Time” podcast, though perhaps he was thinking of not wanting to be the next Joe HartRob GreenPeter Bonetti etc etc. After that shocking revelation from Mikel John Obi, perhaps a good time to read back the interview he did with David Hytner ahead of the tournament. Have a bang on some David Squires.Wayne Rooney thinks England did the right thing by having a go-slow against Belgium and has played the classic “if anything, we’re too honest card”. “For me personally, it’s the right decision,” he told ESPN in Washington DC. “The result, in my opinion - I can say it now, I’m not (an England) player - the result was the best result for England. And maybe that’s been a problem we’ve had the last 15, 20 years as a country: we’re too honest. We sit there and say we want to win every game. This is England. This is how we should play. When all the other countries are plotting their way through, I’m sure Gareth would have liked to have kept the momentum going, but sometimes you need to take a step backward to go forward. I believe it was definitely the right decision.” And with that, I’m going to scuttle off for a break. John Brewin will be your host. Enjoy, enjoy.Many apologies to Alfredo and Lionel, but Diego Maradona is surely the greatest player in Argentina’s history. The greatest manager they’ve had? Not so much. El Diego coached his country at the 2010 World Cup, where they were ked out of sight by Germany, 4-0, in the quarters. Now he’s offering to take over from current coach Jorge Sampaoli, who might have a contract until 2022 but isn’t exactly odds-on to see it through. Maradona was asked by Venezuelan TV whether he’d be interested in doing the job again, and he had no hesitation in replying: “Yes, and I would do it for free. I wouldn’t ask for anything in return. People think I am happy but my heart is heavy. I feel really bad that everything we built with so much effort we destroyed so easily.”Meanwhile the Swiss coach Vladimir Petkovic has cited the cultural ersity within his squad as a major reason for their success so far. Two of Switzerland’s biggest stars, Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka, are ethnic Albanians and of Kosovar heritage, and Petkovic says: “We have managed to bring together different cultures, different talents, different ideologies and they help us to play really good football. We have a team where the chemistry is right, that really goes together, and this is a guarantee for success.” He’s also setting his sights further than the quarters. “What you’ve seen throughout the tournament is that we have been playing really well. We can be a surprise to those who underestimate us. We want to win against Sweden but I don’t think that should be our final objective.” Switzerland will be without the suspended Fabian Schar and Stephan Lichtsteiner Johan Djourou is likely to start in defence. “For our team every missing player is a loss, but at the same time we have a total of 23 in our squad. I can rely on all of them and I’m quite confident that the two who replace them will play just as well.”If Switzerland win this afternoon, they’ll reach the quarters for the first time since 1954. They hosted the event that year, and looked to have one foot in the semis when they went 3-0 up on Austria by the 18-minute mark, only to eventually lose 7-5. The match became known as the Heat Battle of Lausanne, with Austrian goalkeeper Kurt Schmied and Swiss captain Roger Bocquet both treated for sunstroke at half-time.

But the Korean FA have decided not to pursue charges, a local bobby explaining: “Throwing eggs is considered an assault, but it’s also an offence which can’t be prosecuted without the victim’s objection.” Thank goodness they at least registered that win over the Germans, because last time round they finished bottom of their group, and upon returning home from Brazil were pelted with toffees, the most heinous of insults in Korea.But it’s not all bad news for South Korean sport ...The result of today’s match between Sweden and Switzerland is already in. Sort of. Achilles, a deaf cat who normally prowls around the St Petersburg Hermitage museum in the insouciant style, has predicted a Swiss victory. He’s done this by chowing down on a plate of food with the Switzerland national flag stuck in it. But do we trust this Achilles? Is he a chancer? What’s his backstory? Well, he’s already predicted two victories for Russia, Iran’s win against Morocco, and Brazil’s triumph over Costa Rica. The only one he’s got wrong is his choice of Nigeria over Argentina, but the Albiceleste were useless, so you can hardly blame him for calling it the way he did. He’s got form, then. Worried Swedish fans can console themselves with the fact that the banner pictured is not square, and is therefore the civil ensign of Switzerland and not the national flag. Maybe that invalidates the whole process. We can’t take it seriously now.In defence of Neymar. Here with it is John Ashdown (not our one):I had the misfortune of watching xXx: Return of Xander Cage in theatres and thus remember well the bit of acting by Neymar. The scene ends with him and Samuel L. Jackson being blown to bits by an incoming missile, which I suppose will please most of your readers:But I offer this: every team needs a lightning rod like him, a player that attracts all the media flak and controversy (Ronaldo does this very well for Portugal, for instance).By being the centre of attention, Neymar deflects criticism from his teammates and manager. Our conversation about Brazil might have been that they’ve been a bit sluggish that they have a dubious pair of centre-backs that Tité’s tactics are not versatile that his bench is inexplicably shallow (Geromel? Renato Augusto?!?). Instead, it’s all Neymar all the time.Speaking of which, as a Welshman I fully support that this live blog discusses Neymar and the Switzerland-Sweden game and absolutely nothing else today. Thank you.One last, poetic word on brave, broken Japan. And it comes courtesy of Swastik Basu.I absolutely love the subplots peppered throughout the World Cup. In the final group game against Poland, Japan stopped playing as the result in the Colombia-Senegal match was going in their favour and they didn’t want to risk conceding goalsyellow cards which would lead to elimination. Ironically they went through on Fair Play points!The Japan manager was ashamed, he stated publicly that he regretted his own tactics, and promised to make up for it in the round of 16. The shadow of the ethical transgression was clearly looming large as Japan decided to attack Belgium even as they were 2-0 up. Many would call it tactical naivety. I would call it redemption.They took something away from football in that last group game. They gave something back yesterday.Belgium, by contrast, can now look forward to an exciting quarter-final tie with favourites Brazil. Well, sort of. Here’s what their coach Roberto Martinez has been saying. It’s expectation management straight out of the Roy Hodgson playbook.When you play against Brazil, you need to understand they are the best team in the competition. We can enjoy it from the first minute. I don’t think anyone expects us to go through to the semi-finals.Stirring rhetoric. Say what you like about Alf Ramsey, he knew the power of positive thinking. “Gentlemen, most certainly we will win the World Cup.” It’s not a bad way to work.Japan’s veteran coach Akira Nishino insists he should be blamed for their heartbreaking defeat. The 63-year-old didn’t park the bus when his side went two up then he sent his men up for a corner deep into stoppage time, an aggressive decision that had huge consequences.I don’t think the players were to blame, I think it was me who might have lost control of the game. When the goal was conceded, I blamed myself, and I question my tactics. As for the result I am very disappointed. I am devastated. When we were 2-0 up, and I didn’t change my players, I really wanted to score another goal and we did have opportunities.Perhaps when it all comes down, the poor chap will console himself with the knowledge that Japan have made an indelible impression on a World Cup at last. They contributed to an all-time classic in style. Nobody will forget these Samurai Blue in a hurry.Belgium’s spectacular win over Japan was certainly a performance for the ages. It was the first time a team had come from two goals down in a knockout match since Mexico 70, when West Germany avenged 1966 by beating Alf’s England in the quarter-final. That was a story told expertly by Simon Burnton in our World Cup Stunning Moments series. Apologies to anyone old enough to remember the pain of that particular defeat ... but otherwise, enjoy!It’s just as well Gareth rolled the dice, though. Because had England won Group G, we’d never have witnessed last night’s instant World Cup classic between a desperate Belgium team and a Japan side in full banzai mode. Stuart James was at the Rostov Arena to witness history.But should England be playing Colombia at all? Had they sent out a full-strength XI against Belgium, there’s a chance they’d have been paired with Japan last night instead. Here’s Barney Ronay’s expert take on Gareth’s Great Gamble.It promises to be quite the festival of football in Bermondsey tonight. Folk on the Kirby Estate have decorated the whole place in the cross of St George ... though there is a lone Colombian flag fluttering defiantly in the breeze.Hats off for that to Jorge Marmolejo (second right) and his family, enjoying some good-natured fun with their friends and neighbours. The World Cup, bringing us all together in peace, love and harmony. Also, any old excuse to post a picture of a cute puppy.Anyway, England. This evening against Colombia, they’ll be looking for their first win in the knockout stage of a World Cup since 2006. That’s when David Beckham scored the only goal against Ecuador in the last 16, setting up a quarter-final against Portugal, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Cristiano Ronaldo, all that. Here’s Kevin McCarra’s report of that game. Just 24 comments below the line for an England match! More innocent times, eh.There’s more on Sweden-Switzerland in the latest edition of World Cup Football Daily. Olof Lundh is your go-to guy for that Max Rushden and Barry Glendenning are on hand, as always, for just about everything else. Enjoy!Could Sweden win the whole thing? Well, laugh it up if you must, but they’ve already barged their way past Italy and Germany, and they are one of the World Cup’s great over-achievers. For a country with a population of just ten million, their record is nothing short of outstanding. They made the semis in 1938 and 1994, and the final pool in 1950. Best of all, they reached the final itself when hosting the tournament in 1958: here’s how the  reported their eventual 5-2 defeat to Brazil. And this is how a 17-year-old Pele saw it.Of course, they’re no Uruguay (pop: 3m). But then who is?Right. We’ll get onto the subject of England at some point, no doubt. But before their big game against Colombia this evening, Sweden take on Switzerland in St Petersburg. Our man Marcus Christenson runs the rule over a collective that has no stars, and may just be all the better for it.But first things first ... you have been keeping your wallchart up to date, haven’t you? If not, be about your business. Off to the fridge, or wherever you’ve pinned it up, with you. Let’s get up to speed, and then take things from there.Good morning, everyone. You’ve obviously heard there’s a match on today.One final email before I hand over to Scott Murray in London. “I think that people aren’t giving Neymar enough credit,” writes Kári Tulinius. “When he riles up opposition defenders they tend to lose their heads, creating opportunities for others. Yesterday’s opening goal was created because the entire Mexican defence was so focused on kicking Neymar that they forgot about Willian. When they panicked Neymar snuck round the back and stuck in Willian’s cross.” And with that thought deposited in your heads, I’ll bid you adieu, until tomorrow when we will have a final eight of the 2018 World Cup!On the scoresheet from the spot that night in Kiev was one Wayne Rooney (along with Steven Gerrard), who will be watching the Colombia game with interest from his new digs in Washington. When asked if he would be disappointed if England did go on and win it (they won’t), he dismissed the questions as “unfair”. You could label them plenty of other things too, to be fair. England and penalty shootouts – the unhappiest of bedfellows. The pair seem to be inextricably linked when it comes to the knockout stage of major tournaments, and more often than not, it ends badly for England. Of the eight shootouts England have been involved in, they’ve lost seven and won just one – at Euro 96 against Spain (they’d later go out to Germany on pens). The most recent came in the 2012 Euros quarter-finals against Italy, when Ashleys Cole and Young both missed. In case you needed a refresher:The goodbad news is that Young has put his hand up again, should it come to it (it will come to it). “Of course I’ll put my name forward,” he said. “I have the confidence in my ability to step up and take one. I’ll definitely be one to put my hand up. We’ve worked on them in practice and I have confidence in my ability to score more.”After today, the unthinkable – two whole days of no live football while we all prepare ourselves for the quarters, which start with Uruguay v France on Friday. The French seem to be finding le groove just at the right time, with Kylian Mbappé having announced himself on the world stage in the last-16 win over Argentina. But in Uruguay, they will be truly tested for the first time in Russia. More from Eric Devin here:Compare and contrast. The agony and ecstasy of the World Cup in two parts.Vidyanshu Mishra emails: “Wondering if Spain’s football chief’s decision to sack Julen Lopetegui was a good idea? How far you can expect a team to go if you change the manager just before tournament and appoint someone with far less experience and completely different tactics. For sure it conveyed the message that such unethical and disloyal behaviour by a manager will not be accepted but whether it was more important than performance of the team is a point that should be discussed.”This, by Sid Lowe, may contain some answers:From a Swedish dependance to an Australia one – that of outcome dependency. They may be long gone from the tournament, but the Socceroos’ failed campaign is still being dissected. Here, Ante Jukic expresses his fears that, despite the flaws highlighted in Russia, nothing will change once incoming coach Graham Arnold takes over the reins.So what of today’s second game: Sweden v Switzerland? ’s football editor Marcus Christensen is pretty well placed to run the rule over Sweden’s chances of reaching the last eight – it’s all about the collective, rather than the inidual, in this post-Zlatan world.“There are no stars (apart from maybe RB Leipzig’s Emil Forsberg) any more. The two forwards are Marcus Berg, who plays for Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates and Ola Toivonen, who doesn’t play for Toulouse. The key midfielder has been Sebastian Larsson, who was relegated with Sunderland in 2017 and spent last season with Hull City in the Championship (although he is suspended for the game against Switzerland).”Reckon you know who this lot are?Neymar aside, Brazil are beginning to look ominous as other players around him step up their game. Willian is rapidly becoming their strawberry cream, Philippe Coutinho the toffee penny, and Paulinho the vanilla fudge. Nick Ames started the chocolate analogy:“From the Seleção, a selection box of treats. While their rivals falter, beset by rusting parts and in some cases complete mechanical failure, Brazil roll on and their claim to a sixth World Cup now looks more persuasive than at any point in the past four years. The strut of champions-elect is returning and, as players and staff piled on after Roberto Firmino’s far-post tap-in, it did not take an outrageous leap to envisage similar scenes unfolding 13 days down the line when this often bewildering summer party finally winds down.”Sad news from Japan, where the psychic octopus who correctly predicted the nation’s first three World Cup matches has been killed and sent to the market to be sold as food.Anyway, enough of the hatchet job on Neymar. He’ll probably have the last laugh when he lifts the trophy in just under two weeks anyway. “That Belgium goal,” kicks off Daniel Stauss. “The breathtaking thing about that Belgium goal was how Lukaku opened up miles of space on the right for Meunier to run into while de Bruyne was bringing the ball upfield. He was a force of nature the Japanese defender was swept up in his path, the poor guy couldn’t help himself. By the time Lukaku wheeled off into the penalty area, he had completely bamboozled two defenders into closing on him. That run was one of the best off-the-ball offensive moves I’ve seen in a long time, and far and away the highlight of the tournament so far.”It was one of the best breakaway goals seen at a World Cup, for sure. It’s difficult to think of many better, but how about Salif Diao in Senegal v Denmark in 2002 and Ilie Dumitrescu for Romania against Argentina in 1994 for starters?Update: This had passed me by, for reasons that are perhaps understandable, but it appears Neymar actually has a real acting career. According to IMDB: “Neymar was born on February 5, 1992 in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, Brazil as Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior. He is an actor and producer, known for xXx: Return of Xander Cage (2017), Above the Noise (2017) and Shakira Feat. Carlinhos Brown: La La La - Brazil 2014 (2014).” Speechless.“Morning Mike!” It’s actually mid-afternoon in my part of the world, but good morning to you, David Penney! “Did anyone else notice that Layún also stood on the linesman’s foot just as much as he did Neymar’s? I didn’t see the linesman flopping around like a beached fish. It’s instances like these that make football such a laughing stock to fans of other sports.”“You can’t even say Neymar is good at acting,” writes dubod22. “He makes Steven Seagal look like Marlon Brando.” The way the ref simply ignored his shenanigans perhaps proved his lack of acting prowess. Indeed, acting and footballers, with a few notable exceptions (Vinny Jones in Lock, Stock and Eric Cantona are two that spring to mind), should never mix. Juan Carlos Osorio, the Mexico coach, said of Neymar’s attempts to put himself in contention for an Oscar: “I think it’s a shame for football. We wasted a lot of time because of one player. We stopped too often. I think this is a very negative example for the world of football and all the children who are following this game. This is a strong sport, a man’s sport and I think there shouldn’t be so much acting.”The sentiment is, obviously, spot on, if not quite his assertion about football being a “man’s sport”. One can only assume he hasn’t watched a women’s game, in which there is usually little to any playacting, ing, writhing or rolling at all. If anything, Neymar, and other men of his ilk, should take a leaf out of those women’s books, in my opinion, and get up off the floor and just play football. OK, it’s time to talk Neymar. On my TV, they’ve just replayed his antics following the “stamp” on his foot, and I can’t keep quiet any more. What on earth was he thinking? Why the need for such playacting? He’s one of, if not the most, skilful player on the planet. He dances around players for fun. Beat teams with your talent, Junior, not some ridiculous B-grade acting. Of course I might be wrong, and it might have really, really, really hurt. But I’m sure you’ll forgive my scepticism.“Can we just say a big thank you to the Japanese team.” Yes we can, Jacob Vienna. “No time wasting, no dirty tricks, no fouling to break-up play, no overlong substitutions, no arguing with the ref, no rolling four times over for a fake foul, no clutching the back of the head after being hit in the back (some of these may or may not be based on actual incidents).. Japan played with pure sportsmanship. Thank you Japan.”Indeed, there has been a sense of serenity to Japan for the most part at this World Cup, both on and off the pitch. Which, rather ironically, couldn’t have been more far removed from the circumstances of their ultimate demise at the hands of Belgium, as Nick Miller writes:The last time England played Colombia at a World Cup, 20 years ago, Glenn Hoddle’s side prevailed 2-0, thanks to goals from Darren Anderton and David Beckham. Graeme Le Saux was in the lineup that day in Lens and the left-back remembers well coming face to face with the legend that was Carlos Valderama – and his hair.“The funny thing with Valderrama was he had loads of bracelets on. He literally jangled. Every time he received the ball you could hear him. It was like a sleigh because you could hear all his bangles jiggling about. Then his hair had its own sort of gravitational field, so you could sense him coming either by listening or feeling that his hair was somewhere in your vicinity.”Gold star for Ben Aitkenhead, who is first to wade into the James Rodríguez debate with both an email and a comment below the line. That’s the kind of coverage Denmark would be proud of. “Hard to overstate how important James is to this match,” Ben writes. “Imagine the angst if Kane was injured and doubtful. James is The Man for Colombia.” Pekerman is playing down his importance, but of course he has to do that, faced with the prospect of not having his star player to call on.First up, something from yesterday to warm the cockles of even the coldest of hearts. The World Cup will, on some levels, be a poorer place without them. And their fans, for that matter. I haven’t had a chance to listen to this yet, but the blurb says: “Max and co discuss Japan’s last-gasp exit, Brazil’s win, classic play-acting, scoring records, Swedish babies and Ricky Martin.”I have no idea how they get around to Ricky Martin, but such is the joy of the pod. Do yourselves a favour etc...Please, please don’t ever end, you gorgeous thing, 2018 World Cup. After yet more drama – pure, unfiltered, thrilling late drama in the case of Belgium’s game against Japan – we are now just two matches away from a complete quarter-final lineup in what is well on its way to becoming a classic tournament. And the good news is that there is potential for more thrills and spills later today, if you can possibly take any more, with the evenly-matched Sweden and Switzerland vying in Saint Petersburg for a spot in the last eight.What’s that? Oh yes, England are playing Colombia too. But that’s almost certainly not going to be an incident-filled, heart-wrenching banger of a match, one that definitely won’t end in an agonising penalty shootout defeat for Gareth Southgate’s brave Lions and won’t be swiftly followed by industrial-sized vats of tears, a poor unfortunate pariah and the inevitable period of mourning and soul searching and a national inquest. No siree, nothing much to see at Moscow’s Spartak Stadium later on.I’m here for the next few hours to help dissect Belgium’s incredible come-from-behind win over Japan and Brazil’s victory against Mexico, which included an eye-catching performance from Neymar – and no small amount of skill from him on the actual pitch. We’ll also have a look ahead to THE BIG ONE later on. And, perhaps, Colombia v England.Throughout the course of the dayeveningwhatever it is where you are, please do feel free to get in touch on email (mike.hytner@the) or Twitter (@mike_hytner) or below the line.

It is also tricky to light – the little pilot flame may burn enthusiastically, but how long it will take to ignite the whole oven, if at all, is anyone’s guess. Last year, when a lasagne for many had to be baked and I was at the point of throwing the oven out of the window into Via Crispi, my partner Vincenzo took the lighter from me as if disarming me and pulled a chair up to the oven. He then sat with a holiday-coloured drink in one hand, the lighter in the other and stayed there until the oven of a thousand baked pastas, the gas-fired heirloom from his late and much-loved Grandma Sara, burst into life with a gassy poofff.Once lit, I am reluctant to turn it off, even in the height of summer. Occasionally I am organised with a sequence of things – one of the endless savoury tarts that fuel our holidays, a plain cake or tray of easy biscuits. But mostly, after whatever needs cooking is cooked, I end up bowling red peppers or aubergines into the belly of the Bompani beast and turning the dial up to fierce.It was during one of those sessions, with a pair of deepest-purple and pendulous aubergines, that today’s recipe came about. Magical things happen to aubergines when baked whole, although it doesn’t look like it with their skin wrinkling and charring, their taut form collapsing like a deflated bouncy castle the day the fair packs up to move on to a new town. Inside, though, the spongy flesh is transforming into soft almost-silkiness.Aubergines need about an hour – in an oven you can control that’s at 200C390Fgas 6 – then to be set aside until cool enough to handle. Once their charred skins have been pulled away, the now-collapsed flesh is the most unprepossessing thing, looking exactly like a grubby dishcloth – especially when it is set dripping over the sink.More often than not, I turn this silky, slightly smoky flesh of baked aubergine into a baba ganoush-like dip, which, over time – like much in our edible life – is turned into a pasta sauce.Recently I have changed the method slightly, chopping a clove of garlic, a handful of pine nuts or almonds, and a good pinch of parsley, then cooking these gently in olive oil, before adding the roughly chopped aubergine flesh and seasoning with salt and black pepper. Throwing shape- and sauce-matching rules to the wind, we have eaten this sauce with spaghetti, casarecce, rigatoni and fusilli, and topped, as here, with a blizzard of salted ricotta, which has a sharp sheepishness that’s a perfect match for the satiny aubergine.Don’t forget to turn the oven off.2 large aubergines500g pasta – spaghetti, rigatoni, fusilli or penne1 clove garlic1 small handful flat-leaf parsley10g pine nuts5 tbsp olive oilSalted ricotta, gratedSalt and black pepperBake the aubergines whole, directly on the rack, for 45 minutes to an hour, or until collapsed and wrinkled, then take out of the oven. Once cool enough to handle, pull away the now-charred skin – a task best done in a sieve over the sink – and leave to drip. When they are dry, chop roughly.Put a pan of salted water on for the pasta. Chop the garlic, pine nuts and parsley, fry gently in the olive oil over a medium flame until fragrant, then add the aubergine flesh and stir. Taste and season with salt and pepper.Cook the pasta until al dente, drain and then add to the aubergine. Toss together, ide between bowls and serve, passing around grated salted ricotta."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60c831ace6d0d8bbb308f3d9295b02095a5b0733/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0120dc07c30112fa651ae0ecced3c9e","title":"sir martin sorrell wpp mediamonks s4 capital","story":"MediaMonks is one of a number of companies that S4 Capital is seeking to acquireSir Martin Sorrell is in talks to buy MediaMonks, the Netherlands-based digital production group, as his first potential acquisition since leaving WPP earlier this year.Sorrell launched his own company, S4 Capital, just weeks after resigning from WPP following an investigation into allegations of personal misconduct, which he denies.

As adolescents, it was the place we would mooch around on Saturday afternoons, flitting between the handful of shops that might interest us, killing hours over a Coke in McDonald’s. As an adult, my local high street is a place not just to shop but where I know people – the barber, the cafe owner, the fella in the hardware store, the pub landlord, the drunk guy who is always hustling for a quid to buy more lottery tickets. It’s a place of local characters as much as it is two parallel rows of buildings.The high street is woven into the fabric of the lives of everyone living in a town or suburb, which is why the concept of “the high street” has its own place in the news. Just the past few days have brought us stories such as “50,000 jobs lost or threatened on high street this year” “How to mend Britain’s broken high street” “Costa owner blames falling sales on high street decline”, and that’s before we even get to the travails of John Lewis. The high street is a cipher for everyday life. Despite that, and despite British pop’s celebration of the mundane and the parochial, the high street has never been a central location for pop. There is High Street by Blood Orange, which isn’t really about the high street – despite its references to Ilford Lane, a high street in north-east London – until the end, when Skepta raps about the everyday sights: “Single mom struggling with the pushchair  She had a bad mouth but she had good hair  Stole a phone in the shop getting looked at  Barbershop, hairline’s getting pushed back  Guys looking at me like they wanna fight me  Just another day on the high street.” The reference to the barber links it to one of the greatest pieces of English pop parochialism, Penny Lane by the Beatles, where there’s “a barber showing photographs  Of every head he’s had the pleasure to know”. Paul McCartney’s is an idealised high street, where no one is looking at him like they want to fight him.In Shopping, the B-side to the final single by the Jam, Beat Surrender, Paul Weller wasn’t bothered about the high street as any kind of metaphor for a life either contented or disappointed. He was, as the on-the-nose title suggests, out shopping: “As I flit from window to window  I’m trying to pick out a friendly bargain.” It’s an odd little song, and it’s not hard to work out why it was a B-side rather than even an album deep cut. In pop, the high street usually serves as either a token of the everyday, or a locator for songs about the wider metaphorical horror of the suburbs. Ignoring the fact that lots of people live in suburbs because they like them, the idea of the outer districts of cities as wastelands has long preoccupied British songwriters. In Suburbia, Pet Shop Boys are “lost in the high street, where the dogs run … in this suburban hell”.That idea of the suburbs as somewhere to escape from permeates British pop, with the writers willing themselves into lives surrounded by People Like Them, rather than salarymen with narrow horizons, frustrated housewives (the two go hand in hand in much British pop) or the violent thugs of songs such as Everything But the Girl’s Hatfield 1980.Hop across the Atlantic, though, and it’s often a different story. Where Britons have high streets, Americans have main streets, and it’s often a rather less depressing place. “Down on Mainstreet” is where Bob Seger goes to watch “this long, lovely dancer in a little club downtown”, and where Blood, Sweat and Tears see Lucy, who “looks like a Wow!” when she’s “walkin’ down Main Street, lookin’ down”. It’s where people go cruising in Carole King’s Main Street Saturday Night.But US writers saw their main streets ripped apart by the flight to out-of-town malls, similar to how British high streets are now being hit by internet shopping, Brexit and economic uncertainty. In 1984, in My Hometown, Bruce Springsteen noted “Now Main Street’s whitewashed windows and vacant stores  Seems like there ain’t nobody wants to come down here no more.” In Nobody Home, Amy Grant sang of “Main Street USA boarded up and dry  Knowin’ what once was here just makes me want to cry”.Those lyrics speak of an empathy for and love of Main Street that isn’t as present in British songs. When British high streets are boarded up in song, as in the Clash’s Groovy Times, it’s a symptom of how we live in a terrible dystopia. The obvious explanation for the differing tones lies in geography: the US is a nation of small towns, or at least a nation whose art, from Norman Rockwell to Thornton Wilder to Harper Lee to Springsteen, has paid attention to the lives of those small towns and the communities that live in them. When your nearest big city may be hundreds of miles away, it concentrates the mind on looking for positives as well as negatives.To British ears, that can signify a sentimental streak that isn’t there when British writers remember growing up in Huddersfield or Crawley or Oswestry, or wherever. But it makes for a less wearying perspective than the endless procession of British songwriters disparaging the (usually) comfortable lives they led before the city called, and bemoaning the narrow minds of the millions who choose not to live in the city.If you want a British pop song that captures both sides of the high street – the American promenade and our own rather more desolate view of it – try Vicky Verky by Squeeze. Chris Difford’s couple “really trooped the colours  When walking with each other  And all her mates would giggle  As ladylike she’d wiggle  All along the high street  They’d splash out on an ice cream.” Except he’d got the money by robbing people, and ends up in borstal.Vicky Verky doesn’t end on a bleak note, though: back together, the pair go camping and to the coast, where she tells him: “I think I want that chance back  To be perhaps the one  Who will forever love you.” Of course, they couldn’t rekindle their love on the high street: the shops were probably all boarded up by then."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d04d9631d4ed9acab39f7701972a2e4c27aa44c3/196_204_3350_2010/master/3350.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=580816aa038cd3f2a7797b04de29b92a","title":"how we made art of noise close to the edit anne dudley paul morley","story":"‘We sampled a neighbour’s VW Golf and the group saying “money” played backwards. To our amazement it got to No 8’We were a studio team working with Trevor Horn, producing records like ABC’s Lexicon of Love and Malcolm McLaren’s Duck Rock. But we started playing together in our own time. Trevor had got a new synthesiser from Australia, a Fairlight, which fascinated us. It made it relatively easy to put in a sample of, say, a dog barking, and then play it in different pitches.We wrote a piece of music with lots of different sections and samples. There was a neighbour’s VW Golf stalling, and group members Gary Langan and JJ Jeczalik saying “urgh” , and “money”, which we played backwards. Gary set about editing it all. This was back in the day when you had to literally slice tape with a razor blade. We ended up with something quite quirky but we certainly didn’t think it had legs as a single. To our amazement, it got to No 8.I never wanted to be a pop star. None of us did. We wanted to be anonymous, and if we’d had our own way we’d never have done any TV appearances, but once the ball starts rolling you have to go with it. Top of the Pops was one of the worst experiences of my life. We’d done so many edits of the single I wasn’t even sure what its final structure was. We just stood there behind three keyboards. The director saved our bacon by cutting away to the animated video the record company had commissioned – they hadn’t liked the original one made by Zbigniew Rybczyński, featuring a punkette girl and three blokes in tails dismantling musical instruments with a chainsaw. It was the polar opposite of Duran Duran on a luxury yacht. No one knew how to take us. We were described as techno boffins whereas we had a free-ranging jazz sensibility. Steve Reich and Philip Glass were an influence and we loved the absurdist ideas of John Cage. We didn’t have any pretensions to be doing anything other than exploring interesting sounds and trying to have fun. Close (to the Edit)’s working title was Close to the Edge. We created the music through editing, and so changed the title. Being perverse and provocative I put the brackets in. JJ and Gary would sample whatever was lying around – it all became part of the musical collage. This was before people understood about rights and permissions. For years, every time the phone rang Trevor would freeze, convinced it was someone calling to sue him because we’d sampled them illegally.People didn’t know where we had come from. We were often labelled radical underground dance artists. We even got an award in the US for best black act of 1984. I think I made my excuses. We should have sent the masks to pick it up.A group that made their music in an abstract, mysterious way shouldn’t have been seen actually playing, but we were required to look like a group for TV appearances. We weren’t allowed to have just dancing masks for Channel 4’s The Tube, so we ordered clown suits that were several sizes too small. I did an interview with Jools Holland that consisted of large amounts of silence.I wanted us to be part of a wider musical story. I think we achieved that, as well as anticipating so many things. Daft Punk and Gorillaz have realised our ideas of anonymity and animated performers more fully, and I love to say that we’re the third most sampled group of all time. The proudest for me was the Prodigy on Firestarter. They wanted our “Hey”, the one on Close (to the Edit) – no other would do. The royalties kept me in coffees for many years.• Anne Dudley Plays the Art of Noise is on Island Records.

No 10 would not supply details ahead of Friday’s Chequers awayday with some cabinet members complaining they had not seen it.May made an emotional appeal for party unity at a speech at the Conservatives’ summer ball on Monday evening.“Will we find the boldness, the courage and the discipline to unite as one for the good of our nation and fellow citizens?” she said. “Or will we be ided and allow the scale of the challenge, the complexity of the questions to overwhelm us?” The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has told politicians to stop “squabbling” and put Britain’s economic interests first by reaching agreement at Chequers on Friday. It said time was running out before the 29 March 2019 Brexit date and business patience was “reaching breaking point”.The BCC said the government had made “limited progress” on only two of the 23 issues where clarity was urgently needed so firms can plan their trade following the UK’s departure from the EU. The lobby group said while some assurances had been received on the future status of EU nationals, and the industrial standards regime, urgent questions needed to be answered on subjects including VAT, tariffs, customs and regulation.These include whether a business will need to pay VAT on goods at the point of import and what rules of origin firms will have to comply with to receive preferential tariff rates.The BCC said crucial questions also remained on whether goods would be subject to new customs procedures and delayed at border checkpoints after Brexit, and whether businesses would be able to transfer staff between the EU and UK using existing processes . Members also want answers on whether or not UK firms will be able to participate in EU research and development projects after 2020.Over the past fortnight, warnings from firms including Airbus and BMW about the impact of Brexit on jobs and trade were dismissed by cabinet ministers including Jeremy Hunt and Liam Fox, while Boris Johnson reportedly said “fuck business” when asked about industry concerns.The PBSC called for mutual recognition of professional qualifications and regulatory frameworks after Brexit. It also wants assurances that employees in the sector will be able to fly in and out of EU countries to provide advice and trade across Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b2c98fb69e68a26019e94333b57c34065e8941/544_1484_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78ec7e597aaa6e0c70b9ccfa1a69b336","title":"ed miliband return stand in host jeremy vine show bbc radio 2","story":"Former Labour leader will once again be stand-in presenter of the Jeremy Vine showEd Miliband is to return as a stand-in host of BBC Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine show, as part of his continued push into the world of broadcasting.The former Labour leader also hosts a successful podcast called Reasons to be Cheerful with the former Absolute Radio presenter Geoff Lloyd.His stint as the show’s host last summer was notable for a discussion of lavatories in which the Doncaster North MP asked: “Do you have a vintage toilet you’d be willing to flush live on air?”He also interviewed his brother, David Miliband, with whom he fought it out for the Labour leadership, about refugees.Miliband has transformed his image since losing the 2015 general election, and is now known for his witty Twitter put-downs and miming to Take on Me by A-ha while eating a bacon sandwich on the late-night talk show The Last Leg. “I’m very flattered to have been asked back to present Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine show,” Miliband said. “My death metal career has really taken off since my performance with Napalm Death on the show last year, but I wanted to give something back to the place where it all began.”Miliband will host the programme for three days from Monday 9 July before handing over to the former Conservative leader Michael Howard. Howard, who was once asked the same question at least 12 times by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight, said he was looking forward to the chance to turn the tables. “As a young man I was offered the opportunity of becoming a disc jockey in the United States, which I regret to say I turned down. Now at last I can fulfil that ambition, as well as seeing what it’s like to be the journalist who forces politicians to answer the questions,” he said.The Jeremy Vine show is the biggest current affairs programme on the BBC and attracts a weekly audience of 7.4 million listeners to its midday-2pm slot.Jeremy Vine recently agreed to take a pay cut to remain the show’s host, but has signed up as the new presenter of Channel 5’s The Wright Stuff, which will necessitate a daily cross-London dash.Phil Jones, the Jeremy Vine show’s editor, said: “Political coverage is the bedrock of the programme and this is a sign of how important politics is to BBC Radio 2, especially at such a key time in the nation’s history.“Each day we will cover the big stories that affect our listeners, and continue to inform, educate and entertain the Radio 2 audience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3423bec57b8b18793bb549849c60712c0bf50318/0_137_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb1c0abf21382ddc319a548010a033f0","title":"brexit business says government indecision leading to significant slowdown in investment politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenIn the Commons, at Treasury questions, the Labour MP Adrian Bailey has just asked about the British Chambers of Commerce list of unanswered Brexit questions. (See 10.14am.) He said many were directly relevant to the car industry, and he asked what was the government’s assessment of how much the sector would lose.Robert Jenrick, the Treasury minister who was replying, did not refer to the questions directly. He just said the government wanted to get a Brexit deal that would allow trade to continue on as frictionless a basis as possible.For anyone interested in who the next Conservative party leader will be, the ConservativeHome website has released some fascinating polling.ConservativeHome does a regular survey of Conservative party members, asking them who they want to see as next party leader. It is only a survey, but their surveys have a good record of replicating the results of internal Conservative party elections.For several months the backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg came top in the next leader survey, although Sajid Javid, the new home secretary, leapt into top place in the most recent poll.But these regular surveys are only of limited use because, under the Conservative party’s leadership rules, the members would only get to choose from a shortlist of two candidates selected by MPs. It is generally assumed that Rees-Mogg would never make it into the play-off because he would not have enough support from parliamentary colleagues. MPs vote for the candidate they prefer, but in these contests they are also motivated by the desire to keep the candidate who poses the greatest threat to their first choice off the final ballot paper. And that means knowing how various candidates might perform in the run-off is crucial.ConservativeHome has been trying to find out. In a survey, it has asked members who they would prefer in six potential contests.The findings suggest Sajid Javid is best placed to win a future Conservative leadership contest. But they also suggest that Michael Gove, the environment secretary, would have the best chance of beating him.Survey suggests Johnson would only just beat HuntSurvey suggests Javid would easily beat JohnsonHere is a round-up of some of the Brexit stories in today’s papers.The atmosphere at Westminster last night was so febrile that it was described by one senior Tory as “a bit end of days” as No 10 arranged face-to-face talks with senior ministers before their meeting at Chequers on Friday.Another said: “It feels like the wild west. A lot of ministers have been slapped down for failing to observe cabinet responsibility and yet No 10 are the worst offenders. We are all being kept in the dark.”Elliott and Coates say the plan amounts to a reworking of the “max fac” plan.Two sources said that it was likely to be branded as a successor to the “max fac” plan, which relies on technology to reduce border friction and is supported by Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Michael Gove, the environment secretary, while incorporating many of the elements of the “new customs partnership” plan that they object to. Such a partnership would lead to Britain collecting EU tariffs on its behalf.Some officials made clear that they saw it as primarily a “rebranding” exercise of the plan, which Mr Johnson and others thought they had defeated. One said that the final version, which is still being worked on, could only involve the change of “a comma here and a phrase there”.To shore up his leadership prospects, Mr Rees-Mogg’s allies are said to have interviewed PR firms earlier this year. Although presented as an attempt to kickstart efforts to match the renaissance of Labour activist groups, insiders said that the true purpose was to create a vehicle that could serve as a leadership campaign in the event of a contest for the Tory crown.The revelation comes after reports this week that supporters of Mr Rees-Mogg, an Old Etonian and chairman of the investment company Somerset Capital Management, have raised a war chest of £750,000.In an effort to boost his profile, Mr Rees-Mogg announced at the weekend that he had joined Snapchat, the social media app popular with young people that deletes messages shortly after they are sent.A source familiar with the recent invitation to PR firms said: “They were asked to explain how, if Jacob was speaking at a university, they would go about maximising the publicity and harvesting the greatest number of supporters who could later be converted into voting Tory members.”Everyone threatening Theresa May with chaos, revolt, resignations, and a leadership election if she doesn’t do as they wish needs to think carefully about what might be the consequences of their actions. A vote of no confidence in the leadership called on this issue would in all probability rally the sensible middle to the Prime Minister. Even if it didn’t, any new incumbent would face exactly the same negotiating choices and arithmetic in parliament.Such arithmetic is what any government has to live with. When we negotiated the coalition in 2010, we had to ditch some of our ideas like abolishing inheritance tax in order to secure the overall prize of implementing a viable economic plan.This is a parallel situation – if ardent Brexiteers push too hard they will end up without their main objective. If there is no agreement this week on a plan for customs arrangements, the Commons will be much more likely to vote in the near future to stay in the Customs Union in its entirety.The choice is either to back a compromise plan now or to end up with a more watered-down version of Brexit that would be forced on ministers anyway.What defines the cabinet these days is an absence of seriousness,” says one senior figure in the City. “We are facing some really big serious challenges as a country and the people in charge are frivolous.” The impression of a lack of grip was only reinforced by the revelation that Oliver Robbins, the chief Brexit negotiator, had left a folder containing cabinet briefings and emails from the prime minister on a train ...In Imperium, Cicero describes Pompey as “a petulant child, trapped in the body of an ageing clown. What makes him vulnerable is his delusion that the whole world takes him seriously.” As they gather in Chequers this week, cabinet ministers must remember that the trappings of office do not prevent them seeming absurd. With power comes responsibility and the stakes are too high for the self-indulgent political games too many of them are playing. They should get a grip and grow up or get out.There are only two reasons for removing the leader, to change direction or because the alternative is a major upgrade. No such figure exists to meet condition two. The Tories could use a more inspiring leader but, when one scans the obvious names, inspirational is not the word that leaps to mind. There are some solid performers, some with potential, but none yet with the look of a game-changer.  A change of political direction can only be towards a harder Brexit, but this too will fall foul of the same problems besetting Mrs May. The Tories will still be ided, there is no majority in parliament for such a position and the economic position may well deteriorate. The choice then is between a leader who grasps the complexity of Brexit and wants a compromise that does minimal damage to the economy and a leader who does not but will be forced to accept one in the end.The Local Government Association conference is taking place this week. The LGA represents all parties and is currently Conservative-led, and its chairman, the Tory peer Gary Porter, has said councils will face an £8bn black hole in their finances by 2023.Today Nick Forbes, the LGA senior vice chair and the Labour leader of Newcastle city council, is speaking at the conference. Echoing Porter, he will also says councils face “more pain to come” because of the £8bn funding shortfall. But he will argue that Brexit will make this even more problematic, because after Brexit people will expect better services. According to extracts from the speech released in advance, he will say:People will expect things to be different. That’s what they voted for they voted for change.They will expect to see a difference in their local area, they will expect to see more housing, they will expect to see better local public services.Now, we didn’t paint these claims on the side of a bus, but they are the expectations we will have to deal with nonetheless.To do that, we as local government need a new settlement from central government, one that devolves powers and finances down to local communities.The government has now published its LGBT action plan (pdf), and its national LGBT survery (pdf). And here is the news release about its 75-point action plan, focusing on the government plan to eradicate conversion therapy.My colleague Peter Walker wrote this up in a preview story overnight.Among other things, the survey shows that on average LGBT people are likely to have a lower life satisfaction than other members of the population.Given that the British Chambers of Commerce chart (see 9.51am) may be illegible to many of you, here are the questions in a point size you may be able to read.The BCC says there are 24 questions about Brext where business needs answer.On two it gives the government an amber rating, meaning some progress has been made. Those two questions are:Will I be able to hire EU nationals in future – and under what conditions? What industrial standards will my firm need to comply with in the future, and will the UK stick with the European model that we have strongly influenced?And here are the 22 other questions where the BCC has given the government a red rating, meaning that little or no progress has been made.Will business travel between the UK and the EU involve further administration, costs or visas?Will my business be able to move skilled staff members between the UK and the EU in future? Will UK firms and institutions be able to participate in European R\u0026ampD projects after 2020? Will UK projects be eligible for support from the EIB after 2020? How will the UK replacement for EU Funds work, and how can my company access opportunities? Will I need to pay VAT on goods at point of import? Will I be able to use postponed accounting or have access to more generous deferment account terms to offset the cash-flow issues? Will I need to become VAT-registered in every EU member state where my firm has clients?Which regulator will be overseeing my business in the future, and what rules do I need to follow? Is the UK government going to charge businesses for the creation of new regulatory agencies in the UK? Will conformity assessments on products conducted by a UK body will continue to be sufficient for the product to be sold on the EU market?What dispute resolution and means of redress will be available to my business in the future?Will my business have to pay mobile roaming charges in the EU after Brexit?Will my business continue to be able to hold and transfer data and personal information without any interruptions after we have left the EU?Will I be able to continue trading without tariffs with the EU in the future? What rules of origin will I need to comply with once the UK has left the EU? Will I be able to UK and EU content to be counted as single origin, both when trading with the EU and with third countries?Will my company still have access to markets on the same terms as now once we have left the European Union?How will my business be able to contribute directly to future trade negotiations? Will I still be able to fly people andor goods between the UK and the EU after Brexit day – or could travel be disrupted? Will my goods be subject to new customs rules, procedures and inspections at the UK or EU border in future? Could my shipments be held up and delayed? Will there be new health or safety-related inspections at the UK-EU border that my company will need to deal with? Will I need to do additional customs-related paperwork, including import and export declarations, when trading with the EU?Will my business be able to become a ‘trusted trader’ to move quickly through borders in future – and what will the process be? What, if any, procedures will my company face trading cross-border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?Here is the full list of questions from business about Brexit drawn up by the British Chambers of Commerce, with the BCC’s assessment of whether the government is providing answers. Only two topics are graded amber, meaning some progress has been made. All others are graded red, indicating little or no progress.Business groups are becoming increasingly willing to speak out about their concerns about Brexit and this morning there are two significant interventions in this field.The first is from the British Chambers of Commerce, which says the government has made almost no progress over the last two years towards providing answers to business to the key questions about what will happen after Brexit. It says this is causing “a significant slowdown in business investment”.The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has today published the two-dozen top real-world questions being asked on Brexit by businesses across the UK – and says the government has managed to make limited progress on just 2 of the 24 issues where clarity is urgently needed so that firms can plan their trade following the UK’s departure from the EU.Here are some of the 24 Brexit questions it raises where businesses still don’t know what will happen.On tax, whether a business will need to pay VAT on goods at point of import, and will services firms need to be registered in every EU Members State where it has clients?On tariffs, what Rules of Origin firms will have to comply with to receive preferential tariff rates?On customs, whether goods will be subject to new procedures, and delayed at border checkpoints?On regulation, whether checks on goods conducted in the UK will be recognised by the EU?On mobility, whether businesses will be able to transfer staff between the EU and the UK using the same processes as currently?On R\u0026ampD projects, whether UK businesses will be able to participate in EU projects after 2020?And this is from the BBC director general, Adam Marshall.With the time running out ahead of the UK’s exit from the EU, business patience is reaching breaking point. Businesses have every right to speak out when it is abundantly clear that the practical questions affecting the competitiveness of their firms and the livelihoods of millions of people remain unanswered. With less than nine months go to until Brexit day, we are little closer to the answers businesses need than we were the day after the referendum. It’s time for politicians to stop the squabbling and the Westminster point-scoring - and start putting the national economic interest first. These are not ‘siren voices’ or special interests. They are the practical, real-world concerns of businesses of every size and sector, in every part of the UK.In a separate intervention, the Professional and Business Services Council, which represents firms working in the services sector (eg law, accountancy, consulting, advertising etc) employing 4.6m people, has written an open letter to Theresa May urging her not to ignore the importance of services. There has been a lot of speculation about May trying to keep the UK effectively in the single market for goods. The PBSC is effectively saying services need to retain full single market benefits too.Last week the European Services Forum, which represents the same sector on a Europe-wide basis, made much the same point in its own open letter.Here is the agenda for the day.11.30am: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons.12pm: Jeremy Corbyn speaks at the Unite policy conference. Later delegates will vote on calls for Unite to back a second referendum on Brexit.Lunchtime: May meets the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte for talks in the Netherlands.2pm: James Brokenshire, the housing and communities secretary, speaks at the Local Government Association conference.2.15pm: Crawford Falconer, the government’s chief trade negotiation adviser, and George Hollingbery, a trade minister, give evidence to the European scrutiny committee.2.30pm: Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, gives evidence to the international development committee about sexual abuse in the aid sector.4pm: May hosts a Pride reception at Number 10.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

It has been suggested the inflammation triggered by the scratch might help embryos to implant. Many private fertility centres, including those in the UK, currently offer the procedure with costs reaching as high as £350, although it is not routinely offered on the NHS. But the new research, the most comprehensive study to date, found that the scratch makes no difference to the chances of women undergoing IVF having a live birth.With the endometrial scratch previously thought to be helpful for women whose embryos fail to implant, the team also looked specifically at women who were known to have had two or more embryos transferred but did not become pregnant. Again, no benefit was seen.The team also failed to find a benefit when they considered other differences, such as whether the IVF procedure involved fresh or frozen embryos.However they say women found the endometrial scratch uncomfortable. In addition, five women experienced excessive pain and two had excessive bleeding.Cindy Farquhar, postgraduate professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Auckland and senior author of the research, told the  clinics should stop offering women endometrial scratches.“I think it is unreasonable for clinics to ask for patients to pay for something when there is now clear evidence that there is no added benefit,” she said. “I would hope that it will disappear from the list of add-ons that many clinics have both in the UK and in New Zealand and Australia.”Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital who was not involved in the study, said women who have recurrent implantation failure are hard to treat. “This mini-trauma offered a real potentially exciting way forward and it has become very widely adopted in international practice and in UK practice,” he said. “Now somebody has been brave enough to do a large randomised control trail and shown it has no benefit.”Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women’s Clinic, said in light of the new study endometrial scratching had probably been overused. But he said it is too soon to write off the procedure, adding that work is needed to explore whether it might still hold benefits for some women.“There are different causes of implantation failure: it could be the embryo, it could be the uterus,” he said. “What we need to establish is: in these women is there a uterine problem, and is that problem something that could be treated with this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4439a0d6b9debe539282adb8ad8c60459443333/360_66_3348_2009/master/3348.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e865065acbd33e6f920a443802fab00a","title":"post oxfam charities must come clean on how donors money is spent","story":"Funders want charities to show that every penny they raise goes to the frontline. But what about the vital role of backroom staff?If a week is a long time in politics, four months seems to be an aeon, as least as far as charity donations from inidual givers are concerned.At the start of year, when scandals broke about Oxfam and the Presidents Club, dire consequences were predicted. Thousands of donors were, it was reported, cancelling direct debits as a result of their disillusion with charities. Charity leaders felt they had been dealt another body blow, just as they were starting to recover from the collapse of Kids Company and questionable fundraising practices.This is not to minimise the consequences for Oxfam, which has been forced to make cuts of £16m to its aid programmes and lay off staff, after losing government funding. And Sports Relief saw a big fall in the amount it raised on the night of its televised appeal in March, from £55m in 2016 to just £38m this year – the lowest for a decade. But many in the sector are breathing a sigh of relief that the general impact seems to have been less cataclysmic than predicted.Part of the problem is that funders continue to believe they maximise their impact by giving every penny to the frontline, and they want charities to be able to demonstrate that almost every last penny they raise goes directly to the projects and people they support. This is in line with the narrative peddled by all UK governments since 2010 that public services are “bloated” with administrative staff. In the public sector, this has resulted in vital support staff being valued much less than those on the frontline. For charities, this focus could be lethal, as a new report by the thinktank, Charity Futures, makes clear. In the report, Stephen Bubb, the former chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, points out that charities need to spend money on administration and monitoring in vital areas like safeguarding. He singles out Comic Relief, but there are plenty of other examples where charities shy away from any idea that they have admin costs: Crisis, asking for £26.08 last Christmas to cover the “exact cost” of funding a place at one of its Christmas centres, Combat Stress’s pitch for £21 to pay for an hour of its helplinefor veterans suffering mental health problems, or the RSPCA’s winter appeal request for £8 to feed a cat over three days of the holidays, £10.40 for a rabbit, or £12 for a dog.Bubb and Daniel Fluskey, head of policy and research at the IoF, believe the way forward is to change the language used around fundraising. The Charity Futures report says charities should attach a “warm glow” to core costs by identifying the backroom staff who are integral to a charity’s function.Warm glow or not, more has to be done on the narrative about how charities operate and spend donors’ money.Jane Dudman is the ’s public leaders editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269c9486a2bbf73c8d3937236a78f0bef3536b1c/29_58_4830_2898/master/4830.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8156457e9d90e2b98d2c9d64e654552","title":"cameron norrie laim broady britains lack of depth","story":"Then there were two and that it was Aljaz Bedene, back representing Slovenia, who has left the British men’s ranks so depleted is an irony lost on few. Indeed, though he does not compete for Great Britain any more, he revealed the England football captain, Harry Kane, played a role in his first-round victory against Cameron Norrie.This time last year Bedene was celebrating a five-set win against Ivo Karlovic that ignited the home crowd 12 months on and his four-set victory against Norrie has left British hopes reliant on Kyle Edmund and the teenage wildcard Jay Clarke. Andy Murray’s 11th-hour withdrawal has highlighted how fragile the supporting cast is.Bedene used to be among that number but, not permitted to represent Great Britain in the Davis Cup, having previously done so for Slovenia, he switched back after three and a half years competing under the union flag. This victory must have been all the sweeter then against Norrie, born in South Africa to British parents, raised in New Zealand and college trained in the United States.“Against Tunisia he was pulled down and he stayed calm. I would freak out, because it was an important moment. I kept calm, which was good, although it wasn’t easy, because most of the things went against me.”Norrie certainly had his moments, indeed he took the first set, but ultimately on his second Wimbledon he came up short. Bedene was competing for a sixth time here and perhaps that was the decisive factor – he won two tie-breaks in the third and fourth set, showing a touch more composure at the crucial points of an absorbing match, clinching a 4-6, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory. Nonetheless Norrie turned professional only 14 months ago and to qualify outright, rather than rely on a wildcard, suggests a bright future.“I handled the occasion a lot better than I did last year and I’ve grown a lot over the last year as a player but he just played more clutch than me in both tie-breaks,” Norrie said.All is not entirely lost for Great Britain and Edmund, seeded 21st, is expected to beat the Australian qualifier Alex Bolt comfortably on Tuesday but defeat would leave Great Britain’s men’s contingent staring down the barrel of failing to get anyone beyond the first round for the first time in the open era.Liam Broady, another wildcard, was the other Briton to bow out on Monday, competitive for the opening set against the 2016 finalist, Milos Raonic, but ultimately blown away by the big-serving Canadian, going down 7-5, 6-0, 6-1. As he pointed out afterwards, the British ranks would be strengthened were Dan Evans in attendance but Broady stopped short of questioning the decision not to give Evans a wildcard, having returned from his one-year drugs ban in April. “Dan is a fantastic grass court player, he’s a fantastic tennis player full stop and he’s beautiful to watch on the court,” Broady said. “But the All England made their decisions for obvious reasons. I think Dan understands that as well as anybody.”Considering Broady is ranked 173rd in the world, there is little shame in losing to the 13th seed, even if Raonic won 13 of the last 12 games. If the 24-year-old was competitive in the opening set, eventually losing serve at 5-6 down with two consecutive backhands into the net, here was an illustration of the work that needs to be done to qualify on merit, citing Norrie as the example to follow.“I’m hoping to get to the place that Cam’s in now,” Broady said. “He did a great job of it. It took him less than a year to get into the top 100. It definitely gives me heart to know that type of player can do really well.”Norrie undoubtedly did so in a tight first set, edging it 6-4 but he lost a second in which he broke back twice in a tie-break. The third went the distance again but when a Norrie doubt fault ensured it went the way of Bedene, the Briton was always facing an uphill battle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16e91ca58a8b80bae848b8cd37b4a1c20a1840c/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03a5eb8ba5e19591943f7c7ebf97b4a6","title":"froome slow process lack detail annoy organisers experts","story":"The verdict fell suddenly in the nine‑month saga of Chris Froome’s adverse analytical finding for Salbutamol. Most notably it wrongfooted the Tour\u0026nbspde\u0026nbspFrance organisers, who were expecting a court hearing on Tuesday morning to resolve their attempt, dating back three weeks, to refuse Froome entry to their race on the grounds that with the outcome in abeyance his presence would be damaging for the image of their race.That attempt was rendered irrelevant immediately on Monday morning when a statement from the UCI cleared Froome of any wrongdoing. Crucially, given the length of time the process had taken, there were no hints of a possible appeal. There were also, however, few details from the governing body an explanation came from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which – the UCI made clear – had been involved from relatively early in the proceedings.The Wada statement said, in essence, that Froome had demonstrated the levels of Salbutamol found in his urine samples varied widely enough for the finding to be within a certain margin of error (“demonstrated within‑subject variability in the excretion of Salbutamol”) and that he had been ill and had upped his dosage. It also accepted that in his case a comparative study was not possible because it was impossible to replicate the conditions how the sample had been taken. Crucially, the statement concluded “the sample result is not inconsistent with an ingestion of Salbutamol within the permitted maximum inhaled dose”, mentioning also that there had been “chronic use of Salbutamol at varying doses over the course of weeks of high intensity competition”.The verdict left Froome in the clear to attempt a record-equalling fifth victory in the Tour de France, a double of Giro d’Italia and Tour de France in the same season, and a “quat-trick” of four grand tour victories in a row: Tour and Vuelta 2017, Giro and Tour 2018. Critically, it fell before the start of the Tour de France, eliminating that court case between Froome and the organisers and removing any potential ambiguity over the results of the 2018 Tour. Fans would be able to watch him racing in the knowledge that the case was no longer pending.The Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, was – understandably – frustrated at the way events had left his organisation with egg on its face and he bemoaned the length of time the proceedings had taken. “Above all, it’s a pity that we have had to wait for months, because the lack of answers in all this time has obviously given rise to indecision, doubt and thus to suspicion. That’s where we have ended up.”The one thing lacking in the verdict was a detailed exposition of the nuts and bolts of Froome’s defence, although the cyclist told Sky News that he would be making information public in the next few days. The lack of detail was bemoaned by one anti-doping expert Robin Parisotto, speaking to cyclingnews, said he felt it detracted from the verdict. “It’s now about having full access to the reasoned decision as it’s hard to comment without it,” said Parisotto, a former member of the UCI’s Biological Passport programme. “This is a case where they need to release the report in order to silence the agitators. I’m bamboozled to be honest.”The Froome ruling raised other questions, most notably whether it had established a precedent for further Salbutamol cases. Wada rules – as quoted in the organisations statement on the Froome case – specify that if Salbutamol is found over a certain threshold it “is presumed not to be an intended therapeutic use of the substance and will be considered as an AAF unless the athlete proves, through a controlled pharmacokinetic study, that the abnormal result was the consequence of the use of the therapeutic dose (by inhalation) up to the maximum dose indicated above”.The Froome ruling appears to have departed from that particular part of the rule, because a key factor in the case was the fact that the study could not be carried out in a way that replicated those in which the sample was taken. That will most likely be claimed to apply in other cases. The question of where it left the threshold for Salbutamol was also hanging perhaps Salbutamol would go the way of caffeine, where it proved impossible to regulate the substance by working with a permitted threshold and it was eventually legalised to avoid\u0026nbspconfusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2447541f23cc57d8f695b7716ee5664528ca3b63/830_162_2605_1563/master/2605.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0804009b0108a9a25283540fad9fd136","title":"chris froome team sky leader tour de france","story":"Chris Froome has been named as Team Sky’s leader at the Tour de France after the UCI ended its anti-doping investigation into the four-times winner on Monday.Froome, 33, is seeking a record-equalling fifth Tour crown and fourth in a row, but organisers had moved to block him from racing at all prior to the conclusion of an investigation into an adverse analytical finding for salbutamol at last year’s La Vuelta. This year’s Tour begins on Saturday.Froome currently holds all three Grand Tour titles after following up last year’s Tour and Vuelta wins with victory in the Giro d’Italia in May.He will be supported in France by a strong line-up which includes fellow Brits Geraint Thomas and Luke Rowe, former world champion Michal Kwiatkowski, Egan Bernal, Jonathan Castroviejo, Gianni Moscon, and Wout Poels.Froome is hoping to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-times winners of the Tour, and also to become the first man to do the Giro-Tour double since Marco Pantani in 1998.Froome said: “The last 12 months have been the hardest but also the most incredible of my career. I’ve never started the Tour de France after riding the Giro d’Italia and it has meant a completely different approach to my season. But I learnt a lot from riding the Vuelta straight after the Tour de France last year which has given me confidence coming into this race.“I want to make history with a fifth Tour de France win and fourth consecutive Grand Tour. I am under no illusion about the challenge, but I am feeling ready and I couldn’t ask for a better team to support me. This is the biggest race of the year, in front of the most passionate cycling fans, and I can’t wait to get racing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/581bfae2f21fb4fb4b7133bccf15a1b7133cec40/0_280_4945_2967/master/4945.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5434f1b141ab6b3a207180bf4c2a1f0a","title":"max verstappen austrian grand prix","story":"Speaking before the Austrian Grand Prix, Max Verstappen was unwavering in his self-belief that he alone could turn around his troubled season by “doing nothing”. The 20-year-old also told me he believed he had grown up. “I am getting older,” he said. “I don’t need people shouting at me to tell me what I did wrong.” With his win at the Red Bull Ring, certainly showed remarkably maturity.Where Lewis Hamilton and Daniel Ricciardo suffered from tyre blistering, Verstappen had his rubber under control. The worst damage was caused by the loading through the last two right-handers and the team principal, Christian Horner, believed Verstappen dealt with it superbly. “That is where Max was really cute,” he said. “He backed off through those right handers and made his time in the other parts of the circuit. A really, really mature drive.”The Dutchman was able to keep his rear left cooler than the rear right, a remarkable achievement, Horner described as “unbelievable” and further evidence that Max was right to believe in Max.It was a different story for Hamilton who suffered from heavy blistering, and was forced to stop again before he retired. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, said it had been unexpected but it was noticeable that Ferrari did not have an issue. “Everyone who suffered from the blistering was attacking,” said Wolff. “We were going flat out, and going flat out means you are overheating the surface of the tyre, and that causes the blistering.”Hamilton certainly believed it stymied his charge. “Managing tyres wasn’t difficult it was just that I was trying to overtake,” he said. “That’s the problem you can’t attack with these tyres. That has robbed the fans of seeing any motor racing.”Ferrari may beg to differ and that its car is easier on the rubber is clear. At McLaren however it has just prompted more head scratching. “A lot of people started to have problems with rear tyre blisters,” said Fernando Alonso. “We didn’t and that’s what allowed us to move up the order in the last few laps. We have to understand why we didn’t suffer from blistering, if we did something different compared to the other teams, because that was the key for coming through the field.”Down on power to their rivals at the front of the grid, Austria proved once again that Red Bull are increasingly adept at taking advantage of every possible situation to turn the tables. In China their lightning fast decision to pit under the safety car proved to be a race-wining call for Daniel Ricciardo and once again in Austria their bold decision to pit both cars under the virtual safety car gave them an advantage that was unassailable by Ferrari or Mercedes, even had the latter’s cars not expired.Horner paid tribute to his crew. “You have to have confidence in your boys to nail a double stop with the proximity that the drivers were in there,” he said. “We have got the best guys in the pitlane without any shadow of a doubt. It was a ballsy call but it was the right thing to do and it paid idends.” Wolff admitted his team had got stuck in a “thinking loop” assessing options which proved to be a mistake. Red Bull are suffering from no such distractions and are formidably sharp.Racing in their 50th grand prix in Austria, the Haas team left with every reason to celebrate. Fourth and fifth for Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen was the team’s best finish and enough to pass Force India and McLaren and take fifth place in the constructors’ championship.The team enjoy a technical partnership with Ferrari and use the impressive Ferrari power unit but while the attrition at the front of the field played a part, the team’s pace was ominously strong throughout the weekend. In qualifying Grosjean was sixth, beating Ricciardo and just five-hundredths slower than Verstappen. More importantly the gap to best of the rest behind them – Renault – was a massive eight-tenths. Members of the other midfield teams said they were shocked at the Haas pace with Renault’s Carlos Sainz saying the gap was “a world” away.Haas backed it up in the race and appear to be creating a midfield group of one, to team principal Günther Steiner’s delight. “Everybody realised the potential the car has got, but we just didn’t turn it into enough points. This time, we scored.” he said.Having drawn harsh criticism in the past by employing team orders in Austria, perhaps the Scuderia decided that discretion was the better part of valour this time in not making Kimi Raikkonen move over for Sebastian Vettel.In 2001 Ferrari ordered Rubens Barrichello to cede second place to Michael Schumacher on the last lap, which was not well-received but there was uproar a year later when they once again ordered the Brazilian, who had led every lap from pole, to give the win to Schumacher. Interestingly Ferrari had much less reason to do so that year, with a dominant Schumacher ultimately going on to win the title with six races remaining.This season it appears every point will count and Vettel could have had three more. The team have favoured him in the past over Raikkonen but it may be that switching the Finn who was absolutely charging at the end was deemed too likely to provoke another storm in the mountains of Spielberg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a752611531deae314676a2dd8c2a20a99c3e2d25/0_228_3863_2318/master/3863.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c4202c25eea2ac51f6a0ba9183a30f5","title":"shoestring sailor alec rose round the world sailing","story":"There were two reasons why Alec Rose wanted to sail around the world. One was to visit his son who lived in Melbourne, the other was the simple matter of having done it. Rose was 59 at the time, and working as a greengrocer in Portsmouth. He left on 16 July 16 1967, and got back 354 days later on 4 July 1968. They say there were more than a quarter-of-a-million people waiting for him on the day he landed. The voyage made him one of the most famous men in the country and earned him a knighthood. Sir Alec was absolutely baffled by it. “What,” he asked, “have I done to deserve this?” He went back to work at as greengrocer.Rose’s fame burned its traces on his home town. There’s a lane named after him near the Guildhall, sheltered housing in Gosport, and a Wetherspoon’s pub in Port Solent, and a blue plaque up near the Victory memorial in Southsea. There were plans to mark the 50th anniversary of his homecoming with a get-together in Castle Field, too. The organisers wanted to gather enough people to make “the world’s largest human image of a ship”. They thought it would take 371 but then Guinness told them that a school in the UAE had just broken that very same record and they now needed 4,883. So they abandoned the plan.Maybe it’s for the best. Rose wasn’t the first man to sail around the world, or the fastest, he was just the one who did it with the least amount of fuss. There can’t have been a sportsman who had less interest in his own fame or the bullshit business of bolstering it. Rose had no reason to go other than his want to do so. “I just felt it was my personal affair and really interested no one else,” Rose said. He refused take on any sponsors, to “share his values” with a few choice brands. No one knew whose shirts he wore or which scents he preferred. Because, he said: “I wanted to be captain of my ship and beholden to no one.”Rose paid for the boat, a 36-foot ketch called Lively Lady, out of his own savings. It took him 15 years to scrape the money together. He was a very ordinary sort of hero, a man who embodied qualities a lot of English people like to think we share, and which a lot of English people suspect we’ve lost. “He had immense courage, perseverance, and endurance, but above all modesty,” his friend Sir David Mackworth wrote when Rose died in 1991. “This modesty came out in many ways and I am sure it is the chief reason why Portsmouth, and then the whole country, took him to their hearts.”He was a year behind Francis Chichester, who had just been knighted for becoming the first man to sail single-handed along the old Clipper route, around the Cape of Good Hope through the Roaring Forties to Cape Horn.Rose planned, for a time, to race against him, though he knew he would never win. Chichester’s boat, the Gipsy Moth IV, was purpose built for the trip. The Lively Lady was built in an Indian laundry shed, made out of teak and Andaman padauk. When Rose first set off to race Chichester he got caught in a storm, collided with a freighter, and sailed home again. The press called him “the shoestring sailor”.“I felt such a fraud having a wonderful send-off for the second time in a year,” Rose said when he left again. His friends made an effort with his farewell, because they thought it would be the last they ever gave him. “They would come along and ask if it were true and express real concern.”Rose remembered: “Quite a few believed they would never see me again. They all thought I was completely mad.” But his biggest worry, he explained, was that he wanted everyone to understand that “it was a personal adventure I have saved for all my life, and when I come back I don’t want the ballyhoo that Sir Francis got. That was just terrible.”Rose didn’t even want to take a radio with him, but was persuaded to so he could keep in touch with his wife, Dorothy, who ran the grocer’s shop while he was away. “No one was more surprised,” Mackworth wrote, “when halfway round his modest adventure suddenly became big news.” It wasn’t an easy story to cover, for most of his trip no one had any idea where the hell he was. For weeks at a time there was no news at all. “Watch for Alec Rose” reported the  on 15 March, and “Still No Signal from Alec Rose” on 16 March, then “No Anxiety Yet over Alec Rose” on the 17th. The Daily Mirror and ITN even started chartering search planes to try and find him.Miles below, Rose was busy minding his own business. “I was happy and content, I had all I needed. I had a good boat under me and felt as free as the birds that circled above, I was king of my little world.” When Rose finally re-emerged, 50 miles off the Scilly Isles, Dorothy told him how excited everyone was. “He seemed a bit dubious about the size of the reception that was planned,” she said, “and I told him that if he would do these silly things he must expect it.” Rose never made another voyage, but spent the rest of his life pootling about the south coast and raising money for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6212a15a5126610d43a20f1df43c4582561a4360/0_87_2089_1252/master/2089.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc3b34b48e0ed6452c95810bbf85df4d","title":"talking horses hollie doyle back in the saddle after haydock trampling","story":"‘It’s not serious,’ says jockey returning to action just 10 days after losing teeth in a mid-race tumbleHere’s another for the fat folder marked: ‘Jockeys Being Tough’.

She showed what she can do in her last ride before this injury, when she was second at 66-1 in Royal Ascot’s Sandringham Handicap, on Ortiz for Henry Candy. Good luck to her.\u0026nbspToday’s nap is a 9-2 shot called First Flight (3.45), who is seeking a hat-trick of wins in the fourth race at Hamilton. A half-brother to a Listed winner, this ex-Godolphin beast was, within the last year, rated a stone higher than he is now but the losing run he began with Saeed bin Suroor continued through his time with Heather Main until he bagged a claimer at Wolves last month.\u0026nbspBrian Ellison picked him up that day and won an Ayr handicap with him 10 days ago. I think he got to the front with a degree of comfort and a shade too early that day and can go in again. The market shows a bit of interest in two of the beaten horses from that race, Ballestra and Whatsthemessage, but I’m not convinced they can turn it around.\u0026nbspOn the subject of veterans who’ve come down the weights, Roy Rocket (3.30) is in line for his eighth success at Brighton, having ended a long losing run there last week. That was only an amateur riders’ race but it seemed a plausible return to the sort of form that may make the grey hard to beat here. He’s 11-8.\u0026nbspThere’s 4-1 about Pot Luck (6.45) at Chepstow tonight. Andrew Balding’s runner was very green on her debut in late May but was getting the hang of it by the finish and should know a lot more this time.\u0026nbspTips by Chris Cook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7729cc6ad8ddff670046684f8434208447a45fe8/0_123_1991_1195/master/1991.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a87f81224f5022109ed786390e02fd3","title":"hoverboards why they havent got off to a mcflying start","story":"The gadgets inspired by Back to the Future Part II’s floating skateboards have failed to deliverWe could start by saying “they” didn’t promise us hoverboards. People want hoverboards because they saw one in the disappointing sequel Back to the Future Part II . But that doesn’t mean people haven’t tried to make them. Like other colourful retrofuturist fantasies, hoverboards were a lustmotif that spoke to a whole generation in the way that flying cars and jetpacks did to baby boomers.Problem No 1: how would this thing hover? We have four choices: some type of thrust, a cushion of air, maglev or magic. If it sits on a cushion of air, it is probably a hovercraft, which have been around since the 1960s. One alarming effort by Airboard originally claimed to be a genuine hoverboard but turned out to be a personal hovercraft, looking more like an industrial floor scrubber you can ride. Essentially a floaty scooter, its noisy internal combustion engine allows it to bob about menacingly on a cushion of air, with a drive wheel on the ground to steer it. Looks fun but it doesn’t hover, isn’t a board, and people just don’t want to be seen on a giant lawnmower. If our hoverboard uses maglev – and we have a few examples of those – it inconveniently requires superconductors, cooled with liquid nitrogen to around -135C. Naturally, it also requires a magnetic surface. But they do look the part. First up, California-based company Arx Pax’s Hendo hoverboard. Watching the demo, it feels ostensibly close to that skateboard ideal – it looks a riot to ride, with whooping trialists gleefully floating about 15cm above the floor. But on closer inspection, it screeches like a defective train and is so hard to control even professional skateboarder Tony Hawk spins like a top until he is flung off. And unfortunately the battery lasts just a few minutes. And $10,000 (£7,500) a pop? Next! But what if this tech were extended to an entire skatepark, as carmaker Lexus has done with its Slide hoverboard? Perhaps the closest example yet to Marty’s machine, this gadget houses a liquid nitrogen-cooled superconductor to float above a hidden magnetic track. It keeps the board in place using “quantum locking” – a property of type 2 superconductors that overcomes the tendency of magnets to wobble off and repel each other, using a sort of magnetic, sticky “vortex”. Slide certainly brings us a mite closer to Marty – it looks the part, glides quietly – but there’s no getting away from the fact that, as with any maglev, it needs a special surface. It might be well hidden but there’s still a magnetic track under that skatepark. And that won’t satiate a public hungry for Marty McFly kicks. What about conventional thrust propulsion? The US company ArcaSpace comes admirably close to the ideal with its ArcaBoard. It’s capable of hovering a foot in the air, by dint of its 36 electric propellers generating 200kg of lift controlled by onboard balancing tech to help stabilise it. You can even control it using an app on your smartphone, which is neat. You might only be able to catch some sweet air on this for three minutes, but it’s surely a great start. The drawback – ah, there’s always a drawback – is that there’s no disguising the fact that it looks like a mattress with fans on it. It hardly radiates skateboard chic, and many may balk at forking out $15,000 for a flying carpet. And there doesn’t seem to be much evidence that the rider can control it. What’s the point of a skateboard you can’t do sick tricks on?Then you’ve got flyboards. These are not so much floaty skateboards as flying platforms. The best known example is perhaps Franky Zapata’s jet-propelled Flyboard Air, which evolved from an earlier invention, those funky-looking water-jetpack gizmos also called flyboards – you may have seen beautiful people enjoying them on YouTube. The Flyboard Air is a jet-powered “personal aerial vehicle” capable of vertical takeoff and landing, and can fly at a height of 150 metres at 87mph. While it has obvious emergency and military applications, it was designed to be flown safely, sans licence, by almost anyone who takes a shine to it. A flight lasts 12 minutes but Zapata anticipates longer trips in the future.Canadian inventor Alexander Duru’s Omni Hoverboard is a similar contrivance, which uses fans to create the requisite thrust. It’s essentially a large, rideable drone – think giant desk fan with bootstraps. Its first iteration wormed its way into the Guinness World Records book in the rather uncrowded category of longest hoverboard flight – 276 metres – and the firm is working on a consumer version.Both of these, like many of the drone-derived technologies arriving on the scene, look great fun – even practical – but the nagging problem is … they aren’t skateboards. Last but definitely least are those upright, dweeby, hands-free Segways marketed as hoverboards by Swegways, Airwheels and so on, readily available at any Argos. On any given day, one might see poseurs trundling along the pavement on them, upsetting dogs. These may be fun, but the main sticking points here are that: (a) they aren’t boards and (b) they don’t hover. And they have even been known to set your feet on fire. What a let-down. McFly would have spat out his cornflakes. Surely the real test of a genuine hoverboard is, can you do a sweet flipkick on it? If the answer is no, it won’t do. Back to the Future? More like back to the drawing board."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da679d274723164b1554390889eae2ee1e9a64d5/137_0_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db6730310859c5334ae530477100cc5f","title":"samsung galaxy s8 s9 phones sent photos random contacts","story":"Firm is investigating reports that default messaging app sent pictures without consent Samsung is investigating reports that its default text messaging app on the Galaxy S8 and S9 smartphones is sending photos to random contacts without permission.Users posted complaints on Reddit and Samsung’s support forums about a strange issue that appears to be silently sending photos to random contacts. The Samsung Messages app doesn’t show any sign of sending the photos, meaning the user is completely unaware of the picture messaging.“Last night around 2.30am, my phone sent her my entire photo gallery over text but there was no record of it on my messages app. However, there was record of it on Tmobile logs. Why would this happen?” asked one Reddit user.“Oddly enough, my wife’s phone did that last night, and mine did it the night before,” said Reddit user Sfkn123. “I think it has something to do with the Samsung SMS app being updated from the Galaxy Store. When her phone texted me her gallery, it didn’t show up on her end -- and vice versa.”Reddit user Moosan said something similar had happened to them. “My phone’s battery was super low overnight so maximum power saving had kicked in from a routine I set with Good Lock, and two or three people had been sent photos (just one each, and they were photos I had sent them in the past).”While it’s not clear what is causing the random picture messaging, affected users reported receiving an update to the default text messaging app on their Samsung smartphones that enables Rich Communication Services (RCS). This is the long-awaited replacement for SMS that adds modernisation features such as picture messaging, typing indicators and read receipts.Samsung said: “We are aware of the reports regarding this matter and our technical teams are looking into it.”Affected users are encouraged to contact Samsung directly until a fix is issued.In the meantime, users can switch to another text messaging app, such as Google’s Android Messages, or disable access to phone storage for the Samsung Messages app."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea4e2ca5dc943aa0b2715197019ba4fc1c721525/0_25_2418_1451/master/2418.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17d93aeec221c63779dda8ce6500b376","title":"10 best lesser known lidos open air swimming pools readers favourites","story":"Our recent feature on UK lidos prompted so many readers to share their favourite outdoor pools that we’ve created a follow-up list based on some of the suggestionsThis is such a handsome pool it’s little wonder adam hayton described it as “definitely one of the best”. There are two pools: the 30-metre main tank, complete with springboard, and the baby pool. There is also a play area, a good mix of shade and open sun for those who like to bask on a sun lounger, and a kiosk serving a surprisingly wide range of hot and cold food. The traditional poolside changing cubicles are supplemented by recently upgraded modern facilities. This is a pretty pool in a pretty spot – and one could easily fall in love with it.• beccleslidoJulie Adams and Colinowl both raved about this “brilliant” pool, which sits right on the beach and is one of the most northerly in the UK. It offers the unusual opportunity of a bracing dip in the sea followed by scampering across the road in your togs then sinking into the warm embrace of the heated, filtered seawater. The pool has plenty of vintage charm and the yellow colour scheme brightens up even the dullest of British summer days. It is also a first-class example of what can be achieved when a community group works closely with a local authority to save and sustain a community asset like this. The super-fast metal water slide and excellent cheesy chips at the smart little cafe are the cherries on a very fine cake.• stonehavenopenairpoolBathurst is a riot of colour, from the bright and cheerful murals that smarten up the otherwise austere brick walls to the vibrant sunshades that fly like flags over the picnic area. We agree with poppypoppy that this charming community run pool, with its well-stocked kiosk and heated water, shouldn’t be overlooked.•  bathurstpoolLymington is well-known for sailing, but the glorious sea water baths that lie on the foreshore are worthy of more attention than they receive. Kimmi851 put in a bid for the baths’ recognition and it’s impossible to disagree. The large pool is cleverly ided to accommodate swimmers, paddlers, a giant inflatable obstacle course and other activities beside. And you only pay for what you want to do, so it’s very good value. The sun loungers and wide range of ice-cream flavours will please less energetic bathers.• lymingtonseawaterbaths.org.ukStrand delivers the wow factor the minute you step through the turnstiles. 24beforemylove recommends this Medway marvel, and quite rightly too. The gleaming white pool surrounds are accented with the brightly coloured bridges, walkways and big pink elephant slides that are a hallmark of this pool. The young, and young at heart, will enjoy zipping down the elephants trunk into the filtered and treated river water below. The freeform pool has a rectangular tank at its heart, which keeps serious swimmers happy, and the whole thing is encircled by the largest lazy river at a UK lido. • strandpool.infoFondly known as Wivey Pool by FiGreen and other lovers of this rural gem, this is a community-run pool whose charm lies in simplicity. The pleasing timber buildings that house the changing and plant facilities are basic, but they blend perfectly into the soft, green countryside that surrounds the pool. It sits at the edge of this pretty village’s recreation ground, and in recent years has opened for a brief spell of heated swimming around Christmas. That is a rare treat outside of London, and is to be savoured. • wiveypool.netSince it was refurbished a couple of years ago this 250-metre salt-water leviathan can rightly claim to be the UK’s largest infinity pool, described by eliska2 as “a slightly left-field, not-quite-lido experience”. Swimming alongside the wall on the seaward side, taking in the view to Clevedon’s historic pier and the south Wales hills on the other side of the Bristol Channel is a seaside treat. The marine lake is free to use and a safe haven from the Bristol Channel itself, a dangerous stretch of water for swimmers with a huge tidal range and strong currents. • clevedonmarinelake Madamadams recommended this little slice of volunteer-run heaven. Stanhope pool is an oasis in the centre of the village in this beautiful part of the country. It has a slide and plenty of space to sit and relax around the pool. It feels a little like a secret world, and on sunny days the trees cast pleasing puddles of shade.• stanhopepoolAskham is a charming, heated 20-metre pool with a toddler pool alongside it. It is surrounded by grass that cries out to be picnicked on, and benches are available for bathers who prefer to picnic at a table. If you plan on showering after your swim, make sure you buy a token from reception to operate the showers. There is a little cluster of great pools in this area, including Shap, which was recommended alongside Askham by q321gg8cla.• askhamandheltonRadleyman pointed out the extensive recent refurbishment of Abbey Meadows. The future of this much loved pool was under threat for a time, so to see new life being breathed into it, bucking the trend of lido closures, is a real pleasure. It reopened last month after a £1.3m refurbishment, and this gorgeous L-shaped heated pool is definitely worth a visit.

But what is the best way to say sorry? It was Elton John, pop’s wisest banger merchant, who once said: “Sorry seems to be the hardest word,” and Elt and Blue were right about that. It’s especially tricky for celebrities. In a culture that has realised unchecked behaviour that damages others is not cool, more and more famous people have had to issue public apologies for things they’ve done, said or tweeted. In 2016, a group of conflict management researchers found that apologies that adhered to the following five-point structure were most likely to be seen as sincere:➻ An expression of regret – ie the actual “I’m sorry” (but, importantly, not a justification)➻ An acknowledgment of responsibility➻ A declaration of repentance➻ An offer of repair➻ A request for forgivenessUsing those guidelines let’s find out which apologetic celebrities meant it the most …Earlier this year we all remembered Roseanne Barr existed when her sitcom started up again for some reason. Then it got cancelled. A 1.45am tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett that compared her to “Planet of the Apes” got flagged to ABC who pulled the hit reboot. Barr’s apology was, all told, “very bad”: she blamed insomnia drug Ambien, retweeted almost 100 meme tweets from her followers that seemed to back up her original sentiment, then pleaded, “I honestly thought she was Jewish and Persian-ignorant of me for sure”, which doesn’t really explain or justify the early morning racism at all. Back to Sorry School with you, Roseanne. 15To herald the launch of Arrested Development season five, the cast of the show did a roundtable interview with the New York Times that drew criticism for the way male cast members spoke over Jessica Walters’s emotional retelling of hostile behaviour she experienced working with co-star Jeffrey Tambor. Jason Bateman was particularly mansplain-y in the transcript, and apologised in a series of tweets, starting: “Based on listening to the NYT interview and hearing people’s thoughts online, I realize that I was wrong here.” By the metric, it was a good apology – Bateman said “sorry”, acknowledged he was in the wrong, and offered repair – but it shouldn’t take people online telling you that you should’ve apologised to someone when you were in the room with them crying. 45Jama’s apology earlier this year was one of my favourites of the genre, because it involved apologising for an apology, which is nowhere to be found on the five-point chart. After fans found old tweets from 2012 where the Radio 1 DJ shared a joke at the expense of dark-skinned black women with the caption “Looooooooool”, Jama quickly tweeted “My genuine and sincerest apologies go out, not just to dark-skinned women but to ALL women,” which was a real zero out of five. A follow-up explained how what she did was bad, but not much by way of repair or asking for forgiveness. Work to do. 35In 2017, Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme made headlines after kicking photographer Chelsea Lauren during a gig and putting her in hospital for the night. The ensuing apology was, by a chart I am beginning to begrudge, good: Homme said sorry, explained without justifying, did some forward-looking to a time where he doesn’t kick photographers in the camera so hard it hits them in the face (“Yeah, I’m gonna have to figure out some stuff I think”) and even went so far as to apologise to his wife, brother and children. Hate to have to say this about a man who kicked a photographer in the face but: good apology. 45Rita Ora’s entire career is a performance art piece about how you can achieve success by being loved and loathed by the same number of people at the same time. With the release of hit banger Girls, that theory was proved correct: some camps called it an anthem, while others – including queer artist Hayley Kiyoko – criticised lyrics that presented same-sex feelings as something you catch after a good bottle of wine. Ora’s ensuing iPhone-notes-screenshot apology won a number of fans over, but others labelled her soft coming out – “I have had romantic relationships with women and men … this is my personal journey” – as cynical. Once again, Ora’s Theory of Universal Balance comes through. 55Exemplary form from the Full Frontal host: after calling Ivanka Trump a “feckless cunt” in a monologue about the missing migrant children story that has dominated headlines, Bee backpedalled when critics and fans called her out for using a gendered insult. “It is a word I have used on the show many times, hoping to reclaim it,” Bee explained. “This time, I used it as an insult. I crossed the line.” She then went on to apologise, explain, make good for the future and throw in a joke about Ted Cruz, before finishing on: “I should have known that a potty-mouthed insult would be inherently more interesting to them than juvenile immigration policy.” Watch and learn, Roseanne. 55"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud.

Music can provide handy shortcuts in sound to these locations, too. A wobble of surf guitar – wham – you’re in a Pacific picture postcard. A swagger of slow, southern rap – you’re cruising down Ocean Drive. Alongside the tons of sun-spun US classics, there are lesser-known scorchers too, so let’s wind down the windows for all of them, and let the speakers run hot.Let’s begin with the “king of the surf guitar” himself, Dick Dale, who was born in the entirely inappropriate northern outpost of Boston, Massachusetts. Misirlou began life as a slow, Arabic song from the Mediterranean, first released in the US by Turkish singer Theodotos “Tetos” Demetriades in 1927. Dale sped up the track like a Cadillac bombing down an ocean highway. Next up are the Beach Boys – of course – introducing us to the Californian dreams that they made in pop’s early days. Instead of Surfin’ USA and Surfer Girl, enjoy this gorgeous 1963 album track, which summons up the magical aura of American beach life: “Smell the warm and salty air  See a wave reflect a beam ... Make it real your summer dream.”Then let’s have Marlena Shaw, and the west coast’s own surfside creation myth. “And if you listen carefully  The winds that ride  On the high tide  Whistle a melody,” Shaw explains. “So the people started to sing  And that’s how the surf gave birth untold  To California soul.” A dubious theory, Marlena, but when you’re wearing sunglasses, it’s totally convincing. After that euphoric rush, let’s go for full American heat with Jan Hammer’s Miami Vice Theme, guitars forcing balmy winds through your lustrous 80s hair, and hot, shiny synths rolling up your jacket sleeves.Catch your breath with the Thrills – whose Deckchairs and Cigarettes is an ode to the slowed-down loveliness of San Diego and the soft glow of youth – and the beauty of Through My Sails from Neil Young and Crazy Horse’s Zuma. Named after LA’s long, sandy beach, the album ends on this beautiful, seaside song: “I’m standing on the shoreline  It’s so fine out there,” they sing. We hear more of these feelings in Miley Cyrus’s Malibu, from her latest album Younger Now, where peace comes from the ocean, literally and metaphorically: “Next to you  The sky is so blue  In Malibu.”Now it’s time to wind down as the sun slowly sets. Before we do, let’s remember that the biggest summer hit of recent years was made in Miami. The earwormy Spanish guitars and sweet nothings of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s Despacito took it to No 1 for a record-breaking 16 weeks in the US. Then we fade out with two more beachside classics, all about the memories and promises the golden shores of America give us: Don Henley’s the Boys of Summer and the Mamas and Papas’ California Dreamin’. Even when the sun goes down, we’ll be safe and warm with these songs. Our love for them will still be strong.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd84e2e39b4ac5870c61a1ab52055bd6cbfb7517/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10472673534ba47aa11bdcedb6d38955","title":"pacific hymns the definitive hipster playlist","story":"Seattle, Portland and San Fran aren’t just cities – they’re states of mind, man. So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69bfaee41ee2f082caaf089d346f92af7ac41734/89_4_4508_2706/master/4508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5283e8bc7d43d224132246c384f5556","title":"doubts raised over merkel compromise on border controls","story":"Junior partner in coalition has previously objected to plan, and Austria may retaliateA plan for a new border regime in southern Germany, struck on Monday night by Angela Merkel and her hardline interior minister to defuse a bitter row in the coalition government, is coming under heavy scrutiny.The border deal, hailed by the German chancellor as a “good compromise”, foresees setting up so-called transit centres on the country’s southern border, where asylum seekers who have already been registered in other EU countries will be held until they can be sent back to those countries.Like “airside” areas at international airports, the centres would be located on German soil in geographical but not legal terms, making it easier to deport people held in them.The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, had threatened to resign over the issue of immigration on Sunday night, but the deal has allowed Merkel to avert a fallout between her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union (CSU).However, critics say the scheme is at worst unworkable and at best merely moves the political crisis to another part of the coalition.The transit centre scheme was proposed in 2015 by a CSU politician, Stephan Mayer, but was rejected in the strongest terms by the Social Democratic party (SPD), then and now a junior partner in Merkel’s grand coalition government.Three years on, the centre-left SPD, wary of fresh elections, may feel less inclined to provoke a new crisis, but it could again reject the proposal at a meeting with members of Merkel’s bloc in Berlin on Tuesday. The party leader, Andrea Nahles, said on Tuesday morning that she opposed the term “transit centres”.The proposal could also shift the political crisis south to Austria, where the government said it could take its own measures to protect its borders.The compromise deal between Merkel and Seehofer suggests refugees arriving at the Austrian-Bavarian border who were first registered in EU states that now refuse to take them back, such as Hungary, should be sent back to Austria.A position paper by the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, and his deputy, Heinz-Christian Strache, of the far-right Freedom party, quoted in Austrian media on Tuesday, said: “Should this agreement form the position of the German government, then we will see ourselves forced to take actions to avoid disadvantages for Austria and its population.”Seehofer said on Tuesday he had already discussed a possible solution with Kurz.Meanwhile, migration experts have criticised the border arrangement proposed by Merkel and Seehofer. “The German government has truly made a mountain out of a molehill,” said Gerald Knaus, the architect of the 2015 migration deal between the European Union and Turkey.Knaus, the director of the thinktank ESM, said the deal struck by the German government could have the unintended consequence of increasing migration into Germany, if for example the Greek government used the new agreement to unite families with people who had already arrived in Germany, while in return taking back some asylum seekers who have been fingerprinted in Greece.In addition, Knaus said, the emphasis on transit centres would mean Bavaria bearing most of the administrative burden of registering and processing refugees and migrants who arrive in Germany."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75df84081f7703bac9f9ef6ebce0eefdfb97a305/0_19_5216_3128/master/5216.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c05fcbea094d002ed9b1ceaf662874b8","title":"uk to appoint lgbt health adviser national action plan","story":"Theresa May promises ‘real and lasting change’ following huge nationwide surveyThe government will appoint a national LGBT health adviser and take measures to end so-called conversion therapy as part of a plan to deliver what Theresa May has promised will be “real and lasting change”.The proposals form part of an action plan published by the Equalities Office on Tuesday. It follows a UK-wide survey of LGBT people that had more than 108,000 responses, billed as the largest study of its kind.The 30-page plan contains a series of pledges, including to improve the police response to LGBT hate incidents, more support for LGBT students and teachers and improvements to gender identity services for transgender adults.The proposals, which will receive an initial £4.5m in funding, were welcomed by the campaign groups Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation.Ruth Hunt, Stonewall’s chief executive, said she was “really pleased that the government is listening to the thousands upon thousands of LGBT people who responded to this survey”.The online poll, which ran from July to October last year, sought views from LGBT and intersex people about their personal experiences and interactions with public services.In comments released with the plan, the prime minister said the survey had highlighted where more efforts were needed.“I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction,” May said.The plan promises to end these practices, with the Equalities Office to look into various legislative or non-legislative ways to do so.The techniques, sometimes called “cure” therapies, are based on the idea that being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender is a mental complaint that can be reversed. They are often modelled on mainstream methods of psychotherapy, and sometimes prayer, and are known to be harmful.One man who underwent such a process and then took part in sessions to “cure” him said the experience left him suicidal. He told ITV News he underwent a combination of confession and prayers, supposedly to rid him of a gay “demon”.He then took part in sessions for others, but became depressed and prayed to die. “I wanted God to remove me from the world to lessen my suffering and to lessen the suffering of those around me,” he said.“At the time I believed this was a demon being cast out of me. And I remember the next day waking up and thinking, I don’t really know what that means now. Does it mean I’m a straight man now? Is that demon gone? Did that demon really exist?”Penny Mordaunt, the minister for women and equalities, said: “Our action plan is a step towards everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics, being able to live safe, happy and healthy lives where they can be themselves without fear of discrimination.”May is to host the annual Downing Street LGBT Pride reception on Tuesday evening. Among the guests for the first time will be Peter Tatchell. The veteran campaigner said May had invited him after he was “banned” previously.In a separate statement, Tatchell called the action plan a “welcome start”, but said it fell short on issues such as the deportation of LGBT refugees to countries where homophobia was widespread. The £4.5m budget was “derisory and insulting”, he added.Paul Martin, the chief executive of the LGBT Foundation, said his organisation had worked with the Equalities Office on the survey and he was “delighted that the government has listened”.The study and announcement are separate to government plans to amend the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, making the process by which transgender people can change their legal gender easier. A consultation on this is to begin soon.Mordaunt said she had been struck by the survey showing how poorly served transgender people in Britain were by existing systems and legislations, saying the government would examine how to best speed up and demedicalise the process of changing gender.She said the launch of the consultation was not a delaying tactic. “We want to make it less bureaucratic, more supportive and less intrusive,” she said. Asked if there should be less emphasis on medical intervention, Mordaunt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think that is absolutely right, we already require people to live in their new gender for two years, that is causing all kinds of difficulty and anxiety for people who may have two sets of identity documents … which causes huge problems accessing public services,” she said. Mordaunt said she would also listen to the concerns of some women who have expressed fears that simplifying the process of changing gender could lead to the abuse of female-only spaces, such as domestic violence refuges. “What we are not going to do is unpick the Equalities Act, which protects women-only spaces like refuges for example, we are not going to unpick those safeguards,” Mordaunt said. “Those women raising those concerns are legitimate concerns that we need to address at the end of the consultation but equally legitimate are the concerns of iniduals changing their gender and at the moment are having to make all kinds of strategies to do simple things like use the bathroom or go to the gym. We have to look at this and have a sensible conversation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b3025b2b76b0e67586ff22acb1761b05061c3c3/0_147_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e176b2332bd4d882a8e0e2a6e687503","title":"amlo wins mexico election in pictures","story":"Supporters of the Juntos Haremos Historia (Together We Will Make History) presidential candidate, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, – fill Zócalo square in central Mexico City to celebrate his dramatic election victory.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe architect of a proposed new Dublin Bus route network has said the design is for a city of the future not for the past.On Monday the National Transport Authority (NTA) published plans for a complete redesign of the Dublin Bus network, and the introduction of a once-off fare for all the city’s public transport services.Jarrett Walker, the designer, said the aim was to “make it possible for more Dubliners to get to more places, more quickly”.He said the design was to make using the bus the “logical choice for a greater share of the population,” he told RTE’s Today with Miriam show on Tuesday.“To improve all those things we had to have a system that wasn’t designed based on history, but was designed based on the future. We really did have to take a blank slate and make sure we were designing a network that makes sense for Dublin now, rather than things that are relics of the past.”The plan will see decades-old routes replaced by new itineraries, which the NTA said will result in more frequent, reliable and integrated services.However, a number of journeys that are currently direct will require changing buses, and some passengers living in outer suburbs will have to take more than one bus to reach the city centre.Last month the NTA published plans to upgrade 16 core bus corridors, with dedicated lanes and segregated cycling facilities. However, the redesign of the network will affect every bus route in the city.Mr Walker said the new system will mean changes.“The route numbers that people are used to are extremely confusing to the visitor. I can attest to this. It is my job to come into cities and learn the network . . . people are used to all kind of things that don’t make sense to the visitor and to the new user.”Under the proposed new system, Mr Walker said bus routes in Dublin routes will be lettered or numbered in a way that makes the whole structure of the system really clear.“One of the big ideas of the plan is there will be extremely frequent bus services flowing through the centre of the city in simple paths, called spines and they’re lettered A through G and then further out the spines making branches called G1, it’s designed to be very simple and very easy to learn.“There will still be a bus where you’re used to having a bus, it will probably be something like you’re used to, but there are a lot of changes.”He said the existing bus system was effective in getting people into and out of the city centre but less effective there are many other things it doesn’t do well.“It’s very difficult to travel on the same side of the city without going into the city centre” and added that the service was infrequent in many cases and “immensely complicated”.The report took 18 months to compile and involved a survey on people’s expectations.“We spent a week locked in a room with the National Transport Authority, Dublin Bus and the local authority. We designed the network together with people who know the city. That was the process.”Incorporating Dublin city centre’s medieval streets into the plan was the trickiest part of the project, he said. But it had been a joy getting to know the city and “figuring it out.”The report will now go into the consultation phase before a final plan is agreed. “We always make changes at the consultation phase. It is very rare that you’d discard a plan,” Mr Walker said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550184.1530459659!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"just three nurses recruited this year for hse relocation package","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAccording to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, there were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015. Photograph:  Frank MillerJust three nurses have been recruited so far this year as part of the HSE’s relocation package.The “Bring them Home” campaign was put in place by the HSE in July 2015, offering Irish nurses working in Britain a relocation grant of €1,500 to return to the Irish public health service.Since April 2017, an additional €1,500 is paid after a period of 12 months employment and subject to a commitment to remain in that employment for a further year. Last year, it was decided to extend the package beyond Britain to include nurses from any overseas location.There were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.The HSE said upon its announcement three years ago it was hoping to attract up to 500 staff under the initiative.Irish Midwives and Nurses Organisation general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said that while it was important to have packages to incentivise Irish nurses to come back, the current offering was insufficient.“The figures demonstrate that it doesn’t go far enough, it has to be much higher. In addition, the incentive to stay also has to be included,” she said.“What we found is some who availed of the first part of the incentive left after six months. Recruitment is only one part of the story – retention is an even bigger part. The rate of pay is too low within a global market where you can get better rates.”The HSE said it could not provide a comment on the figures at this time but pointed to the health service employment report published last May, which showed a 4.6 per cent increase in the number of nurses employed over the previous year, from 36,474 to 38,139."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Architect of plan says current system is inflexible and \u0026lsquoimmensely complicated\u0026rsquoHeadline of article had referred to \u0026lsquoNama\u0026rsquos busted tycoons\u0026rsquoGroup speaks out after court ruled hospital acted unlawfully preventing older woman with dementia from leavingMan (21) arrested in connection with death of Cork pensioner in DouglasHosepipe ban to be extended to Galway, Kilkenny, Laois, Kilkenny and parts of LimerickVaradkar and Coveney attend Ireland\u0026rsquos formal launch for UN Security Council seat in New YorkSix people injured when two cars collided in Co Limerick on N20 on Monday morningProgrammes measured on personal development, educational experience, and career developmentWoman found husband\u0026rsquos body in pool of blood after coming home from workPatients will be able to \u0026lsquoremotely\u0026rsquo carry out IVF with donor egg, says companyIreland has been without a US ambassador since Trump came to office at the start of 2017Modern technology and social media has led to huge increase in material that must be disclosed at trialDublin consumption peaked last week at 50 million litres above normal levelsSenior Fianna F\u0026aacuteil figures believe Varadkar is keeping option of autumn election openTaoiseach says important for Ireland to have a place where \u0026lsquoimportant decisions are made\u0026rsquoPassengers on 46a route among those who will be forced to get two buses instead of oneMay says \u0026lsquosome real differences\u0026rsquo remain between UK and European Commission around BorderHealth professionals warn of sunburn and sunstroke as country sizzles in the heat"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551477.1530552756!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no end to the heatwave in sight says met %C3%A9ireann","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEnjoying the good weather at the Forty Foot, Sandycove, Co Dublin, on Monday.

Photograph: Simon CarswellTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said there was “no vanity” in Ireland seeking a seat on the United Nations Security Council the motivation was to protect institutions such as the UN in a changing world, he said.Mr Varadkar was speaking at the UN in New York as the Government formally launched a campaign to win a non-permanent seat on the council, the UN’s most powerful body, for a two-year term in 2021-2022.“The UN is an important place where important decisions are made this is where decisions are made about where peacekeepers should serve,” the Taoiseach told reporters outside UN headquarters in Manhattan after laying a wreath to the 88 Irish peacekeepers killed over the past 60 years on UN missions.“It is where decisions are made on sanctions, it is even on occasion where decisions are made on whether or not the world should go to war. This is no vanity here this is serious stuff.”The Government has drawn criticism for applying diplomatic resources to the efforts to win a seat in the face of intense competition from Norway and Canada as a “vanity project”.Mr Varadkar told reporters that his plan to put Ireland “at the centre of the world” after Brexit meant “embracing a much wider world out there” where power was shifting to the east and south.“For Ireland to do well in this changing new world, we need to protect institutions that stand for multilateralism, institutions like the UN,” he said.Without these institutions, he added, “the big powers call all the shots”.Mr Varadkar considered the campaign to be “a good investment”. Ireland had diplomats in 80 countries but none in the another 100 countries.“This is where we meet those countries,” he said of the UN. “I think we have a really good and really important role to play in that.”Ireland’s two-year intensive campaign of lobbying will culminate in a secret ballot at the UN in June 2020, where the 193 member states will vote on the security council membership. If victorious, it would be the fourth time that the Irish have held a seat at the table, the last being in 2001-2002.Former Irish president Mary Robinson, who is helping the Government launch the bid, said that it was “probably Ireland’s most difficult attempt” to be elected on to the council.UN ambassadors were invited to U2’s concert in New York on Sunday night as part of the charm offensive behind the bid said it was a “very good soft power stroke”, as they rarely come together, she said.“Everybody’s aware that it is a very tough contest,” she said, noting that it was important for Ireland to see a council seat again “at this particular dangerous time in the world”.Mr Varadkar was joined by Vice-Admiral Mark Mellett, chief of staff of the Defence Forces, and a colour party for the wreath-laying ceremony on the 60th anniversary of Irish peacekeeping for the UN.The Taoiseach said that almost everyone in Ireland knows somebody who has taken part in an UN mission and peacekeeping was “very much part of our national identity”.“I really believe that the blue helmet, which is the symbol of UN peacekeeping, is every bit as much a symbol of Irish identity as the shamrock or the harp,” he said.The ceremony was attended by Irish UN peacekeeping veterans Jim Casey (71) and Michael Colton, who escorted the bodies of the nine Irish soldiers killed in the Niemba ambush in the Congo in 1960.“It was the worst journey I ever made,” said Mr Colton.Mr Casey said that it was “very important” that the slain peacekeepers be remembered.“A lot of people in Ireland don’t know what happened on those missions,” he said. “It should be brought to their attention and they should know what’s going on.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Najib Razak picked up from home by anti-corruption agents in state fund probeKey point is the fact none of the boys can swim, says veteran rescue erPhilip Wilson (67) is most senior Catholic cleric in world convicted of concealing abuseThe coach and 12 children found alive nine days after going missingTwelve boys aged 11 to 16 and their soccer coach had not been seen since June 23rdAt least 48 dead after 28-seater bus went out of control in mountainous Uttarakhand stateWorker reportedly grabbed by throat as crackdown on single-use bags angers consumersRescuers are hoping 13 missing made it to elevated rock mound called \u0026lsquoPattaya Beach\u0026rsquoExperts from across the world join mission as receding flooding offers opportunityTwo men held over incident in which child was lured away while waiting on her parentsTwelve boys and their soccer coach missing in cave complex since last weekendTwelve members of youth soccer team and their coach missing in cave complex since SaturdayVisit would mark first to North Korea since Trump-Kim summit in SingaporeProsecutors allege two women smeared nerve agent on North Korean leader\u0026rsquos half-brotherFour people on board and person on ground die in incident in India\u0026rsquos financial capitalMonitoring group says work shows need for denuclearisation deal with PyongyangStruggling economy expected to slide further as new US sanctions come into effectSearch for soccer team enters fourth day, with water proving to be \u0026lsquobiggest challenge\u0026rsquoTwelve boys and their soccer coach missing in cave in Chiang Rai province since SaturdayNavy ers trying to reach chamber deep inside cave complex in Chiang Rai province"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551501.1530554138!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may calls on eu to show more flexibility in brexit negotiations","story":"British Prime Minister gives a statement on Brexit in the House of Commons.

Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesTheresa May has called on the European Union to show more flexibility in negotiations over Brexit, warning that parliament would reject the withdrawal agreement unless it was accompanied by clarity on a future trading relationship.Updating MPs on last week’s European Council meeting, the British prime minister said a White Paper to be published next week would set out “detailed proposals for a sustainable and close future relationship” between Britain and the EU.“I warned EU leaders that I did not think this parliament would approve the withdrawal agreement in the autumn unless we had clarity about our future relationship alongside it,” she said.“The EU and its member states will want to consider our proposals seriously. We both need to show flexibility to build the deep relationship after we have left that is in the interests of both our peoples.”Ms May has called her cabinet to an all-day meeting at Chequers on Friday to agree a common position on key issues surrounding Brexit, including customs and Britain’s future relationship with the single market. Downing Street on Monday declined to comment on reports that the prime minister had a new proposal for the customs relationship after Brexit.Earlier, Conservative ministers and backbenchers rounded on Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg after he warned the prime minister that she risked splitting her party as Robert Peel did over the Corn Laws in the middle of the 19th century.Writing in the Daily , Mr Rees-Mogg suggested that his fellow Brexiteers in the backbench European Research Group (ERG) would vote against the final exit deal if Ms May abandoned her negotiating red lines.“Any attempt by the EU to impose its laws and court on the UK, either directly or indirectly, must be rejected. Any EU agreement that restricts the country’s ability to make trade agreements with other states, restricts our ability to control our migration policy makes us pay to trade or interferes with our fishing waters could not be accepted. Indeed MPs would vote against such propositions in parliament,” he wrote.Foreign office minister Alan Duncan said Mr Rees-Mogg risked debasing “government, party, country and himself” by his insolence in lecturing and threatening the prime minister.“The PM must be given maximum latitude and backing,” Sir Alan tweeted. “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down.”Backbench MP Simon Hoare accused Mr Rees-Mogg of hectoring and blackmail and warned that he risked opening the way to a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn. Another backbencher, Vicky Ford, said there was no majority in parliament for the hard Brexiteers’ vision of Brexit.“If this becomes a binary choice between staying in the single market and customs union or no deal, then I do not believe there is a majority for no deal,” she told the BBC.On Monday evening, foreign secretary Boris Johnson offered support for Mr Rees-Mogg in a complimentary tweet.“It’s vital that all MPs are able to air their views on Brexit. Whatever your position, I hope we can all agree that Jacob Rees-Mogg is a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Indeed, Mexicans joke that “AMLO”, as he\u0027s known, mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005 and a household name, has been campaigning for the presidency for 18 years.Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Mexico\u0026#039s Jeremy Corbyn to battle \u0026#039the mafia of power\u0026#039“It’s a triumph for all the world, all the people,” he told his fans, gathered outside his home in the early hours of Monday. “It’s of millions and millions who are fed up with this regime of corruption and privilege, and who decided today to vote for a real change.“I’m going to do it. I won’t fail you.”Jose Antonio Meade, 49, candidate for the ruling PRI, conceded defeat with lightning speed, announcing shortly after the first exit polls were given, at 8pm in Mexico City, that he had lost.An experienced and well-respected politician, he was severely handicapped by representing the party of despised President Enrique Pena Nieto.Jose Antonio Meade gives a thumbs up after voting on Sunday. He was the first to concede defeatRicardo Anaya, from the conservative PAN, conceded 45 minutes later, saying he had already phoned the winner to wish him well.I recognised his triumph, I congratulated him, and I wished him success, the 39-year-old said.Once his victory became clear supporters streamed towards the Zocalo plaza at the heart of Mexico City, cheering and chanting: It is an honour, to be with Obrador.The plaza was completely full by the time he arrived to give a victory speech in which he underlined his long-time claim that he would head the biggest transformation of Mexico since the 1910 revolution - though he also stressed three times that the transition would be both peaceful and ordered.Nothing to create an economic crisis, he pledged, vowing to respect the independence of the central bank, keep taxation at its current level, and promote business.I will not let you down, he said, to wild cheers from the crowd. We are going to be ruled by three basic principals. No lying, no stealing, and no betrayal of the people. Thousands of supporters of Mr Lopez Obrador crammed into the Zocalo square in Mexico CityA thousand miles to the north, in the border city of Ciudad Juarez – from where he launched his campaign in April - cars were honking their horns as they passed his party’s headquarters, and drivers sped by waving flags, leaning out of their cars and cheering.The long-time friend of Jeremy Corbyn has been the front runner from the start, but has made an extra effort to win over the sceptical northern states. Making his third attempt at taking the presidency, he promised to defeat “the mafia of power” and usher in a new era of corruption-free rule, in which the most marginalised come first.His platform includes promises to sell the presidential jet, slash his presidential salary in two, and turn the presidential palace into a cultural centre. He has campaigned with the pledge of doubling pensions for retirees, increasing scholarships for students, and boosting production and employment in the impoverished south.How he will pay for this remains unclear – his team speak vaguely of corruption reductions freeing up millions of dollars.And he has been remarkably unspecific in his plan for dealing with Mr Trump, Nafta and the surging violence – only talking about rooting out the causes of organised crime, such as poverty and a lack of opportunities among the young, and floating a plan for an amnesty for cartel members.Mr Lopez Obrador in Ciudad Juarez on April 1, to kick off his campaignNevertheless, his message has resonated in a country exhausted by endless corruption scandals and a failure to reduce the incessant violence. As the results were announced in Ciudad Juarez two policemen were shot and injured not far from the headquarters, in another grim sign of the deteriorating security situation which both the PAN and the PRI have failed to calm, and which has driven the city to support Mr Lopez Obrador for the first time.May has been the worst month for murders in the city in seven years, and, dependent on trade with the US, the election has set residents on edge.Mr Lopez Obrador’s candidate for mayor of the city, Javier Gonzalez Mocken, who by midnight on Sunday had a narrow edge over his opponent, told The  his party was going to work on reducing the causes of cartel violence.“Lopez Obrador is looking at the reasons – the poverty and lack of hope,” he said, inside the chaotic party headquarters as the votes came in. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, casting his vote on Sunday morningHe admitted he did not agree the suggested amnesty for cartel members.“In the strict sense of the word, no, I’d not be in favour of that,” he said. “Not if they have killed people. But he’s talking about how lots of people are driving into working for the gangs through lack of opportunity. He talks about scholarships, and universities. That is good for the city.”And he said he was confident Mr Lopez Obrador would establish a working relationship with Mr Trump.He\u0027s a very serious man, he said. Both sides want a deal on Nafta, as businessmen in the US and Mexico are concerned by this uncertainty.We\u0027ve definitely been taken aback by the treatment from Mr Trump - it\u0027s been worse than any other president. We\u0027re concerned by him. So we have elected Mr Lopez Obrador to improve our relations with the US.Mr Pena Nieto addressed the nation on state television, promising to work with Mr Lopez Obrador for a smooth transition.Mr Lopez Obrador will take over on December 1.Please review our commenting policyComment: Forget the Alan Partridge jokes – Richard Madeley is one of the best broadcasters we haveScottish drug deaths hit record high amid calls for radical new strategyRSPCA and National Park urges lantern festival to cancel amid fears of new wildfires Thailand cave rescue: Meet the \u0026#39A-Team\u0026#39 of heroic volunteer British ers who led searchHas Corrie character fallen victim to a superbug?

The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that.

Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

Since the war broke out in 2015\u0026nbspmore than 22 million people have become\u0026nbspdependent on aid to survive, and around eight million of that figure live on the brink of famine.\u0026nbspCivil society has collapsed, with of doctors\u0026nbspand teachers going\u0026nbspunpaid, and the country is in the grip\u0026nbspof the worst\u0026nbspcholera epidemic in modern history.\u0026nbspAn estimated 80 per cent of the country’s food, medicine and other imports flows through Hodeidah, leaving aid agencies sounding the alarm that any damage or hold up in the flow of goods could push Yemen into total collapse.\u0026nbspThe Arab coalition fighting to regain control of Yemen – led by the exiled government, Saudi Arabia and UAE – launched a massive operation to retake the city earlier this month, which it hopes will clear a path to driving rebels out of the capital, Sanaa, and end the stalemate in the three-year-old war.\u0026nbspSky News Arabia reported late on Wednesday night that Yemeni president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi rejected the second of two offers from Houthi rebels, which would allow the Iran-backed forces to remain there\u0026nbspbut under UN supervision.\u0026nbsp“Houthis not treated like any other terrorist militia and\u0026nbsphave dialogue with UN and\u0026nbspopportunity to negotiate political process.

Merkel HANGS in BALANCE as key ally threatens to quit                Merkel holds on: German Chancellor thrashes out last minute dealDescribing it as a \u0026ldquoa really good compromise, she claimed it would secure the principle of freedom of movement within the EU while allowing Germany to take national measures to limit migrant arrivals.But the trio of Austrian politicians said it would cause a domino effect, causing them to assess their own border protections, particularly in the south by Italy and Slovenia.\u0026nbspIn their statement, released immediately after Mrs Merkel and Mr Seehofer made their announcement, they said they first wanted to see whether the new agreement would win the support of the entire government in Berlin.But they added: \u0026ldquoShould this agreement thus become the German government position, we will see ourselves forced to take action to avert disadvantages for Austria and its population.The CSU\u0027s Horst Seehofer may fly to Vienna to meet Mr KurzBorder controls at the Italian-Austrian border pass known as Brenner were also up for debate, the statement explained.The statement said: The German considerations prove once again how important a common European border management is and the Austrian position that a Europe without borders is only possible with functioning external borders, is vindicated.The Schengen Agreement is a treaty which led to the creation of Europe\u0027s Schengen Area, in which internal border checks have largely been abolished.However, if checks are enforced at the internal borders of the bloc, this would start to weaken the principles which allow it to function.Their words come after Mr Kurz outlined his vision for the EU as he prepares to take on the bloc\u0026rsquos rotating presidency.He explained: \u0026ldquoWe want to use these six months to build bridges in the European Union and reduce tensions.\u0026ldquoWe are also focusing on building a Europe that protects, which is the motto of our presidency.\u0026ldquoI think people are justifiably fed up of hearing migration talked about at the EU level, but not seeing anything happen in practice.Meanwhile Mr Seehofer has already had a phone conversation with Mr Kurz about the latest developments, and may fly to Vienna shortly for face-to-face talks.He told German TV station NTV: I have the impression that he is interested in reasonable solutions."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/983125_1.jpg","title":"China secret military base Indian Ocean sri lanka hambantota asia europe","story":" The Grand Aurora vehicle carrier, right, sits moored at Hambantota PortThe $1.5 billion deepwater port is likely to play a major role in China\u0027s Belt and Road initiative and is under a 99-year lease to China Merchants Port Holdings at a cost of $1.12 billion.Government and diplomatic sources have told Reuters that the United States, India and Japan have raised concerns that China might use the port as a naval base.The Sri Lankan government and Chinese embassy in Colombo have denied that and the agreement for the port deal included a clause that it cannot be used for military purposes.Sri Lanka has already informed China that Hambantota port cannot be used for military purposes, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe\u0027s office said in a statement.

Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To which the EU’s Michel Barnier will inevitably reply: “No. It’s full single market membership, including free movement of migrants, or nothing.”Then what? What else has No10 got?There are red lines Theresa May must not cross: free movement, independent trade deals, our courts’ supremacy. She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting.

which is unprecedented in its bluntness - has been leaked to The Sun.In it, former US Marine Corps general Jim Mattis says Washington DC is “concerned” that Britain’s military prowess is “at risk of erosion”.With threats around the world spiralling, America now expects the UK to hike its cash to the military to help counter them “beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests”.In an ominous threat, the general also makes it very clear that while Britain may want to “remain the US partner of choice”, France is already boosting its defence spending - and is waiting in the wings to replace us.President Trump wants an answer from the UK by the time he arrives in Europe next week for the NATO Summit, Mattis adds.The letter’s revelation today is a deep embarrassment to Theresa May, and plunges her into a fresh political crisis.Defence Secretary Mr Williamson, backbench MPs and British generals have all pleaded with her to hike the MoD’s budget and fill its £20bn blackhole.But the PM is adamantly refusing, alongside Chancellor Philip Hammond.The letter from highly respected General Mattis - nicknamed “Mad Dog” when he was in the Marines -  was sent on June 12, three days after he held talks in London with Mr Williamson while his guest at Trooping the Colour.In the two page letter, General Mattis argues that Britain’s position as a leading world power “has been the credibility of the UK’s armed forces”.But he adds: “I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change”.For the first time in the letter, the senior US politician also gives a firm hint that Washington now wants Britain to go beyond  the NATO minimum of spending 2% of GDP on defence, which the government only just about meets at the moment with the inclusion of pensions.Mattis adds: “A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defense (sic) spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.“Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk”.Purposely highlighting Paris’s recent pledge to pump an extra £260bn into bolstering its armed forces by 2025, Mattis adds: “As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defense.“Other allies are following suit.”And dropping the hint that the Special Relationship is now in peril with France in ther wings, Mattis goes on: “It is in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice.“In that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability.“It is not for me to tell you how to prioritize your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defense blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.“In advance of that, the President and I look forward to hearing details of the progress you have made with your Modernizing Defence Programme at the upcoming NATO Summit.”Generals are calling on Mrs May to increase the MoD’s budget to 2.5% of GDP a year, which would see a cash increase of £6bn-£7bn.In comparison, the US spends 3.6% of the biggest GDP in the world on its military.But Mrs May has infuriated Tory backbenchers by repeatedly refusing to commit to maintaining the UK’s status as a Tier One military power, saying only that the UK would be a “leading nation” instead.Former Chief of Defence Staff Lord Houghton warned on Saturday: “US observers have come to realise we are living a lie.“President Trump is not remotely impressed by our national pretension to be America’s greatest ally.”The letter will also be seen as more evidence that Mrs May’s relationship with Donald Trump is under increasing strain.Fears are mounting in Downing Street that the President will use next week’s NATO summit in Brussels to announce a major US drawdown unless more members states step up their military funding.The letter – leaked to The Sun by military sources – has been copied to the Chiefs of the three armed forces, as well as No10, and National Security Advisor Sir Mark Sedwill.Senior Tories last night called on Mrs May to urgently act on  Mr Mattis’s warning.Former  defence minister Mark Francois MP told The Sun: “For many months, the Defence Committee has been arguing that we must increase our defence spending, not least to remain a credible ally of the Unietd States.“This letter is a real wake up call that we need to invest to maintain our leardership in NATO, and I hope the Prime Minsiter takes urgent note.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The victim was left uninjured but shaken by the ordeal."},{"url":null,"title":"brazen couple caught romping in barber shop in full view of street as stunned passerby films them in the act","story":"The brazen pair were filmed in VIP Barbers in Greenock, Scotland, by a stunned onlooker at 4.40am on Sunday while he walked home from his job in a nightclub.The shutters were up on the shop and the lights were blazing to allow passers-by to see the sleazy show.The man who filmed the romp can be heard saying No danger - VIP barbers, twenty to five in the morning.  What the f***!He told The Sun Online: I was on my way to a pals house after work when I saw it.It was the last thing I expected to see at that time of the morning.The wild footage has been viewed more than 46,000 times since it was posted on social media.But others found the 36-second footage hilarious, branding it “typical Greenock”.One said: “Naw be sitting on that seat again!!”Another replied: “Typical Greenock man hahaha x”.Ive no idea who they are but they must have had access to the barbers because the lights were on and music was playing.You expect folk shouting and bawling at that time but not folk romping in a shop.VIP Barbers declined to comment.We recently told you how another shameless pair were at it in a cemetery up against a GRAVESTONE.And a Scots dad went ballistic when a randy couple appeared to be having sex beside his teenage daughter in an airport lobby."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000416943470-e1530567648312.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"piers morgans ego ally ross tv","story":"Not despite that barnacle-brained oaf Piers Morgan, as some of you might think, but largely because of him and his complete inability to keep a lid on a dementedly competitive streak which, one minute, had him ­threatening to “gorge on the innards” of BBC rival Dan Walker, the next, saw him getting soundly thrashed by Richard Arnold in an egg and spoon race.Wiser heads, of course, would have settled for painting themselves into just one corner. Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of. A full-length Scandinavian mink coat.”RANDOM TV irritations: Jeremy Corbyn’s insanely annoying habit of giving a triumphant little sniff every time he thinks he’s made a good point.BBC presenters turning Aneurin Bevan into the L Ron Hubbard of their NHS cult. News ­reporters describing everything that’s happened quite a lot as being: “On an industrial scale.”Over-familiar BBC continuity announcers suddenly greeting me with a: “Hi, I’m Russell.” (Don’t care.) And a bite massage therapist from Hollywood called Doctor Dot failing to provide the necessary health and safety warning before she told This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes: “Ruth’s going to be biting you tonight.”’Cos she’d have bitten off more than she could chew if she did.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “Alphabetically, what day of the week comes first?” Andy: “Tuesday.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “In which decade of the 19th Century was the Crimean War fought?”Simon: “The 1950s.”Andrew O’Keefe: “TV series Twin Peaks is set in which fictional town?”Dan: “Transylvania.”“No, Twin Peaks.” NHS cultists gathered last week to applaud, grovel, sing, dance and grin like madmen in its honour.I exaggerate a bit, obviously. The singing and dancing doesn’t begin until tomorrow night on ITV.It was still an unsettling experience though, watching BBC2’s NHS At 70: Live, from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham, hosted by Anita Rani a level eight cultist from The One Show, Nick Robinson and Helen Skelton, who was in the maternity unit warning that we may “hear screaming”.As well as the massed ranks of staff, there were also NHS bigwigs and former patients who were encouraged to stand, clap and thank nurses, doctors, ambulancemen, chemists, the woman on reception, everyone.The nasty suspicion is, of course, that all this BBC worship, which makes Kim Jong-un’s birthday celebrations look really half-ar*ed, carries a political edge and is designed to shut down every single argument apart from the ones that say:A)The NHS needs more money. Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine. So instead of going to hospital when you crack your head open you will be prescribed tickets to go and see Russell Brand . . .”AAAAAAAAARRGH!The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “In 2017 which Hollywood star was made a dame at the age of 100?”Will: “Joan Collins.” Oof.King Kylian Mbappe taking the World Cup by the scruff of the neck with France’s thrilling 4-3 victory over Argentina.The Sky Planner’s damningly accurate verdict on Bear’s Mission With Warwick Davis: “Contains scenes of moderate peril.”Love Island narrator Iain Stirling breaking into a water fight discussion to announce: “God I’m lonely.” And the magnificent Laura going all Malcolm Tucker on Wes after he admitted he wanted to “crack on with Megan”.“Do me a favour then, f*** off.” Truly, hell hath no fury like a Scottish woman scorned.GOOD Morning Britain, Wednesday,  rent-a-gob Afua “problematic” Hirsch says: “I am English, but why do I feel uncomfortable ­answering that question?”Because if you ever stopped playing the professional victim and admitted this great liberal democracy had afforded you all the most ­extraordinary privileges in life, including an ­expensive private education, you’d swiftly have no point, purpose, job or income, obviously.ON Monday’s This Morning, the arrival of “Britain’s Sexiest Cow”, a Jersey milker called Char, prompted the obvious Schofield question: “What was the competition?”Two Friesians, an English Longhorn and Naomi Campbell, I’d imagine.THIS week’s winner is Simon Cowell and a Hawaiian feather god from the Royal Academy’s forthcoming Oceania exhibition, which you’ve probably booked already.Emailed in by Spud, of London.Picture research: Amy Reading.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Without a Parliamentary majority and with a Cabinet that has ­forgotten Lord Melbourne’s definition of collective responsibility “it is not much matter which we say, but mind, we must all say the same”, nonetheless she carries on.Perhaps the vicar’s daughter is inspired by the hymn “Jesus good above all other, gentle child of gentle mother, in a stable born our brother, give us grace to persevere”.It is certainly a grace she has been given in abundance and it is also her great strength.As the Cabinet prepares to assemble in the Buckinghamshire countryside it may choose to reflect on what we have already done and it should consider what unity and determination can deliver.The European Communities Act will be repealed next March. The country is now leaving the EU in its own domestic law, just as the UK was already leaving the EU in international law under the relevant treaties.The United Kingdom has irrevocably set a new course. One where the nation will be free to make its own laws and conclude its own trade agreements, free to take back control of its immigration policy and no longer obliged to pay “Eurogeld” in return for the dubious privilege of following EU laws.The question for the Cabinet at Chequers is what to do with the freedom the British people want reinstated.Does it seize this great opportunity to do things better, to forge new trade relationships, to have better laws, regulations and policies, or does it follow the managers of decline to place a once proud country in a tremulous state that sees Brexit as mere damage limitation?This is a historic decision and one the Prime Minister is well placed to make. Theresa May has the vision and has put the law in place to leave the EU. However, there are political challenges ahead.There is a need to overcome a fear of the future. In leaving the EU, the UK will have a new relationship with it based on trade without political convergence. Trade between two friends and partners who respect each other’s internal legal authority.This is the case for the majority of world trade. Yet there are still those who advocate the vassal state, with the UK accepting the domestic application of EU laws as a price of trade — something no other trading partner agrees to.Then we need to call the Irish bluff. There is no insurmountable problem concerning the Northern Ireland border and any solution which would split the UK in two is outrageous. That the EU suggested it is offensive.This fake alarum should be seen for what it is: Domestic Irish politicking in advance of a general election, with Dublin being gullibly exploited by Brussels.The Irish government, if not the European Commission, thought that Dublin had “cast-iron guarantees” which suited them last December, then again last March, and they had hopes of finally getting them in June.They have been disappointed each time by their friends on the continent. Ireland is being used by the EU to put pressure on us. The Taoiseach’s announcement that he is supporting Belgium over England might get cheered in Irish pubs but it is not getting them anywhere in Brussels.What ought the Cabinet to decide on Friday? Above all it must maintain the clear negotiating line set out at the beginning: No deal is better than a bad deal, and plenty of bad deals are on offer.Fortunately, David Davis, with his titanium-plated spine and his ministers in the Department for Exiting the European Union, have ensured that preparations for a “no-deal” scenario are well advanced.There can be no sensible argument that we have to take a bad deal because a “no-deal” outcome has not been prepared for. This is simply incorrect, primarily thanks to the Brexit minister Steve Baker.The Cabinet should agree that if there is to be a deal, it has to be agreed in detail prior to our departure.There is no legal reason to pay £39billion to the EU on our departure and if there were no guarantee of a trade agreement, it is something I would strongly oppose in any vote in the House of Commons.Likewise leaving the EU into the purgatory of a perpetual transition would be foolish.If a bad trade agreement should be rejected, what exactly is a respectable one?It must be judged against the UK’s economic interests but there are some things that no independent nation could agree to.Any attempt by the EU to impose its laws and court on the UK, either directly or indirectly, must be rejected. Any EU agreement that restricts the country’s ability to make trade agreements with other states, restricts our ability to control our migration policy, makes us pay to trade or interferes with our fishing waters could not be accepted. Indeed many MPs would vote against such propositions if brought to Parliament.In this regard Michael Gove was right to tear up any form of the idiotic customs partnership. The Prime Minister commands the support of Brexit-backing MPs, Conservative Party members and Brexiteers in the nation at large.This is why her opinion poll ratings remain so high. Yet the metropolitan establishment of fashionable society and the beau monde is still against her. Theresa May must stand firm for what she herself has promised.One former Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, did decide to break his manifesto pledge and passed legislation with the majority of his party voting the other way so leaving him dependent on opposition votes.This left the Tories out of majority office for 28 years, 1846 to 1874. At least he did so for a policy that worked.At Chequers the Prime Minister must stick to her righteous cause and deliver what she has said she would. She must use her undoubted grace to persevere.It is incredible to watch Europhile Tories savage Jacob Rees-Mogg simply for insisting, as he does on this page, that Theresa May should keep the promises she has repeatedly made.Of course she must. The future of her Government and our democracy hinge on it. Yet her top aide Oliver Robbins reportedly intends on Friday to demand that the Cabinet signs off what amounts to a betrayal of the referendum vote.His strategy, to stay in the EU’s single market for goods, already looks fatal to regaining full control of immigration, freeing ourselves from the sway of the European Court of Justice and striking our own trade deals.And that’s before Brussels formally rejects it, as it will. Michel Barnier will then demand full single market membership, with free movement, and kill our ambition to trade independently too.What will Mrs May do then?The Sun has always believed her pledges to take back control of our ­borders, laws and money. We still agree that “no deal” is better than a bad one. But the EU is now clear that a bad deal is our only option — and Barnier admits he’s not even negotiating.Will the PM ever say enough is enough and honour her “red lines”? Or will she cross more of them? How is Robbins’ plan Brexit? It’s not.Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, David Davis and Liam Fox must not stand for it. Nor must sensible Cabinet Remainers.Voters are not dumb.

I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction.“No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love “This LGBT action plan will set out concrete steps to deliver real and lasting change across society, from health and education to tackling discrimination and addressing the burning injustices that LGBT people face.”LGBT hate crime had been experienced by 40 per cent of those surveyed, with more than nine in 10 of the most serious offences going unreported.The plan aims to look into the scale of LGBT abuse online, improving mental healthcare, combating bullying in schools, and increasing awareness of the services for victims of sexual assault and domestic abuse.Laura Russell, of the LGBT campaign group Stonewall, said it was “heartbreaking” so many people had been offered conversion therapies.She added: “Our 2015 Unhealthy Attitudes report revealed that one in 10 health and social care staff across Britain witnessed colleagues express the dangerous belief that someone can be ‘cured’ of being lesbian, gay or bi.”Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell backed the move on conversion therapy.

I was later told I had tonsillitis.Its so unfair on all of us. I had a really good holiday but at the end I just wanted to get home.Nobody should have been in that situation.Im still in a lot of pain today and will be going to the doctors later.I would never use Thomas Cook again.One passenger told Sun Online they saw many people having panic attacks while others reportedly stripped to deal with the unbearable heat.Pregnant women and babies were apparently left to their own devices, while passengers claim two people were rushed to hospital.Desperate holidaymakers say they broke into chanting in a bid to leave the overheated aircraft, with temperatures said to reach up to 48C in the back of the plane.The 214 people on flight MH1805 were expecting to fly to Stansted airport at 2pm, and were initially told the delay was down to the plane needing to be refuelled.They say they were repeatedly told they were taking off in a few minutes, and forbidden from leaving the grounded plane.Lee Palombo was on the plane with his wife Flordelise, a nurse who rushed to assist a pregnant woman who was struggling to breathe.The 43-year-old from Papworth, Cambridgeshire, said passengers begged for water but were denied it.“I can’t fathom why they didn’t give us any drinks, he said. Someone could have died on that plane.“I’m very concerned that they would keep people on the plane in that boiling heat, I’m healthy so I was okay but people were getting really ill.Diabetic passenger Isabella Wright said she nearly passed out from the heat and lack of food and described their treatment as horrific and a breach of human rights.The nightmare continued off the plane, as exhausted passengers were finally sent to hotels after the flight was eventually cancelled.A pregnant lady was said to have been taken to different accommodation and told to stump up cash, and ended up spending the night in workers accommodation without air con or a shower.Isabella Wright added that her hotel room was dirty and unhygienic and had no clean spaces for her to carry out injections vital for her diabetes.A Thomas Cook Airlines spokesperson said they would be looking into the individual claims, and confirmed passengers had departed Zante at 9am local time this morning - 19 hours after the scheduled departure.They added that passengers were taken to a number of different hotels where they could get rooms, and all passengers were given welfare and dinner in addition to a hotel.We tried to fix the issue so that we could get customers on their way as soon as possible, but we recognise that we should have disembarked the aircraft earlier."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000417645548.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"women cant find men freezing eggs","story":"Experts said women were increasingly forced to act due to men in their 30s feeling too young or busy chasing a career.It challenges the previous belief that “social freezers” were too focused on their own jobs to become mums.Most of the 150 women quizzed who stored their eggs had achieved their career goals, the US study found.

It comes in response to a major paper, published by Ministers last month, on how as many as 3.5 million EU citizens can apply to stay in the UK after Brexit.The Government wants to charge £65 for adults and £32.50 for children, which is the same as the cost of a standard residency application.But Mr Verhofstadt has said that EU nationals, who could not vote in the referendum, should not have to pay a penny if they were in Britain when Theresa May began Brexit negotiations in March 2017.He fumed: “It is unacceptable that citizens who were never consulted on Brexit should have to pay to retain their existing rights.”The demand comes despite the Brexit chief admitting last month that member states had not lived up to their side of bargain by guaranteeting ‘free movement’ for British ex-pats living on the Continent.British officials insist the charges represent a “fair amount” to help bankroll the scheme, which will cost taxpayers £170 million. In the letter Mr Verhofstadt also raises concerns about how an independent monitoring authority to guarantee EU citizens’ rights will work in practice.And he calls for a “dense network” of information centres to be set up across the country where people can get help filling out their applications.Euro MPs also want the Government to commit to ruling on whether or not people can stay within a short window of as little as two days.

Recent outbreaks have highlighted its ongoing threat.In September last year, the World Health Organisation declared that the elimination of measles had been achieved in the UK.Elimination of measles can be verified once a country has sustained interruption of endemic transmission for at least 36 months, according to the WHO.The UK has also reached the WHO target for 95 per cent of five-year-olds to receive the first dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.Its thought the sharp rise in British cases is linked to outbreaks in Europe, where take up of the MMR vaccine has been low.There have been 48 measles deaths reported in the EU since 2016 and take up of the jab is typically low in countries including Romania, France, Greece and Italy.Public Health England has called on young adults and teens planning to go abroad over the summer to check they are vaccinated.The age group is vulnerable as take up of the MMR jab fell heavily in the late 1990s following research by Andrew Wakefield which suggested a link between the vaccine and autism.However, his work was discredited and he was struck off the medical register in 2010.Numbers having the jab also dipped to a low of 80 per cent in 2003.Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications.Its now uncommon in the UK because of the effectiveness of vaccination.Anyone can get measles if they havent been vaccinated or they havent had it before.It usually clears in 7 to 10 days but can lead to other serious complications.Symptoms:Initial symptoms include:A few days later a red-brown, blotchy rash will appear, usually beginning on the head or upper neck before spreading.Youll most likely feel most ill the first few days the rash appears.Complications:About one in every 5,000 people will die from measles.Complications are more likely to develop in:The most common complications include diarrhoea and vomiting, ear infections, eye infection, pneumonia and bronchitis.But measles can also lead to other complications, although these are rare:Treatment:There is no specific treatment.Your GP will probably suggest resting at home and waiting for it to clear.You can ease your symptoms with pain killers, but always speak to your GP first.You can avoid measles by getting vaccinated.One dose of vaccine can be given to a baby when they are 12-13 months old and a second before they start school.Countries where vaccination levels are higher have less chance of the disease spreading.Source: NHS Choices Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: In the early 2000s there was a fall in MMR vaccination coverage in children and as a consequence, we are now seeing measles cases in young adults.Measles can be more serious in adults with a higher likelihood of hospitalisation and complications arising.Measles is circulating in England and the rest of Europe.We often think about what travel-related vaccines we might need before going on holiday, but its also important to check that we are up to date with routine vaccinations like MMR.If you are unsure if you have had two doses of MMR call your GP practice to check and catch up if needed.Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, added: This is so disheartening when we consider how close we came to completely eradicating this unpleasant infectious illness and achieving medicine’s ultimate goal of confining this awful disease to the history books.“Unfortunately, we had major setbacks in the 1990s when false claims about the MMR vaccine caused panic which led to a significant drop in the numbers of parents allowing their children to be immunised, and the latest figures would appear to indicate that we are still feeling the impact.We ask all parents to do the right thing, including when returning from abroad, and have their children so that we stand the best chance of permanently eradicating measles in the future.”Parents were urged to protect their kids after warnings of the deadly measles outbreaks in Europe over the Easter holidays.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The future of her Government and our democracy hinge on it. Yet her top aide Oliver Robbins reportedly intends on Friday to demand that the Cabinet signs off what amounts to a betrayal of the referendum vote.His strategy, to stay in the EU’s single market for goods, already looks fatal to regaining full control of immigration, freeing ourselves from the sway of the European Court of Justice and striking our own trade deals.And that’s before Brussels formally rejects it, as it will. Michel Barnier will then demand full single market membership, with free movement, and kill our ambition to trade independently too.What will Mrs May do then?The Sun has always believed her pledges to take back control of our ­borders, laws and money. We still agree that “no deal” is better than a bad one. But the EU is now clear that a bad deal is our only option — and Barnier admits he’s not even negotiating.Will the PM ever say enough is enough and honour her “red lines”? Or will she cross more of them? How is Robbins’ plan Brexit? It’s not.Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, David Davis and Liam Fox must not stand for it. Nor must sensible Cabinet Remainers.Voters are not dumb. They will smell a sellout instantly.It would be a national calamity — suicidal for the PM, her Government and party.“It’s not negotiation - it’s a capitulation.”Senior Eurosceptic Tories confronted the PM in the Commons yesterday to angrily demand the PM scotch other rumours that she wants the UK to join the European Economic Area alongside Norway – the ultimate soft Brexit.Sir Bill Cash branded EEA membership for Britain as “preposterous” and that it would “undermine democracy if that were true”.Mrs May replied: “The EEA would not deliver on the vote of the British people.”Sir Desmond Swayne asked Mrs May if Brexit could still be “recognised as Brexit”.To laughter from Opposition MPs, Mrs May quoted her own catchphrase to insist: “There has been much jocularity around the term ‘Brexit means Brexit’, but it does mean Brexit”.Arch Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, exploded rivalries by warning Mrs may she would split the Tories in two as Sir Robert Peel did in 1846 if she gave up her Brexit red lines to strike a deal with Brussels.The Somerset MP also called for Theresa May to stand firm for what she herself has promised.He was savaged by a series of Tory moderates, including foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan.Accusing Rees-Mogg of “insolence”, Sir Alan accused him of “lecturing and threatening the PM”, adding: “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise \u0026amp should pipe down”.Grandee Sir Nicholas Soames: told him to “shut up” and “put a sock in it.But Sir Alan’s own boss in the Foreign Office, Boris Johnson, leaped in to defend Mr Rees-Mogg.Some pro-EU politicians want Britain to stay in the customs unionafter Brexit - but that has been ruled out by Theresa May, because it would stop us striking any new trade deals with the rest of the world.Last year, the PM set out two possible paths for the future customs relationship between Britain and Europe.One option is the customs partnership - which would mirror many aspects of the existing customs union.It would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods which enter Britain on their way to the continent.The advantage of that would be no border checks would be needed between the UK and EU, particularly on the key Irish border, but Brexiteers worry it would tie us too closely to Europe.The alternative is known as maximum facilitation - a hi-tech arrangement where automated systems check goods as they flow across borders in a way which helps business trade freely.But EU bosses have cast doubt on whether the right technology exists to make that solution work.While the row may seem technical, many Brexit backers regard it as crucial for the UK to take total control of our trade and customs arrangements, or risk making our EU departure pointless.Theresa May faces a major challenge finding a solution which is acceptable for both hardline Eurosceptics and the pro-EU Tory rebels.The Foreign Secretary tweeted: “ It’s vital that all MPs are able to air their views on Brexit.“Whatever your position, I hope we can all agree that Jacob Rees-Mogg is a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country.”Mrs May was due to address rich Tory donors at the party’s annual summer fundraiser at the posh Hurlingham Club in West London.She will also travel to the Netherlands today to explain her latest thinking to Dutch PM Mark Rutte, and Berlin on Thursday to see German boss Angela Merkel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Children are frequently reported to experience panic attacks, bed wetting and altered behaviour when a parent is detained.The criticism comes in the wake of family separations in the United States, where images of imprisoned children screaming for the parents has prompted widespread condemnation. In the UK, Home Office regulations state that children are neither split from both their parents nor placed in detention for immigration purposes.But in less than two years Mr Beales says BID has dealt with several cases in which Home Office enforcement has meant children being taken into care.Among them are the four children of Kenneth Oranyendu, who was detained when he reported to the Home Office after dropping them off from school in March.His wife was in Nigeria for her father\u0027s funeral at the time, and the 45-year-old begged immigration authorities to allow him to pick his children up from school. But he was referred to an immigration detention centre 200 miles away, and his children placed in care.Within a few days of his arrest Mr Oranyendu\u0027s wife was able to return to the UK to collect the children, and the family are now together after he was released on bail.But he still has to report to the Home Office every two weeks, and fears he could be detained again. His children, aged between six and 17 and all British citizens, have been \"shattered\" by the separation.\"Every time I go out of the house they are afraid I\u0027m not going to come back,\" he said. \"They are terrified we will abandon them, and suffer from panic attacks. They wake in the middle of the night to check if their mum and dad are still there.\"Mr Oranyedu has a conviction for drugs smuggling - a crime he denies - and was detained by immigration detention after he served his sentence. His supporters say he is being punished twice because he is not a British citizen. The Home Office told Sky News human rights were \"fully considered\" Mr Oranyendu\u0027s case, and that his status as a \"foreign national offender\" meant protecting the public and preventing crime were taken into account.Government guidance says children must not be separated from both parents for immigration purposes, and set out that the decision to detain any parent should be \"necessary and proportionate\" with regard to the children concerned.A spokesperson said immigration procedures would not result in children being taken into care unless in exceptional circumstances, and said children\u0027s welfare and safeguarding was at the heart of family returns."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-medellin-columbia_4351190.jpg?20180702114817 ","title":"facebook gave 61 firms extended access to user data","story":"The dating app Hinge, alongside corporations including AOL, Oracle, Nisan, Panasonic and Snap were among those to receive the extended access.Mark Zuckerberg, the social media company\u0027s founder and chief executive, previously accepted responsibility for the breach ahead of a Congressional hearing.He said: \"We didn\u0027t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake.

Welcome to the bizarre world of a hereditary peer by-election The lucky winner will get to speak in the House of Lords, claim a \u0026pound300-a-day allowance, and have the right to shape and vote on the laws of the land.  The system is a bizarre hangover from Tony Blair ’s attempts to modernise the House of Lords.    When the ex-Labour PM mostly abolished inherited peerages in 1999, he agreed to let 92 of them stay in the House of Lords as a compromise. Almost two decades on, the situation has still not been resolved.  That means when one of the hereditary peers dies or retires, the peers that got booted out in 1999 get first refusal on his or (very rarely her) seat. The retirement of Lord Glentoran at the age of 83 has opened up a vacancy. And because he was a Tory, only Tory hereditary peers in the Lords - of which there are 47 - can vote.

Some politicians pockets hundreds of thousands of pounds a year working as company directors, barristers and advisers to big business. The independent Committee on Standards in Public Life today says they can keep the roles, but demands more transparency.  Launching the report, committee chairman Lord Bew said: “A majority of MPs do not hold remunerated outside interests, and a number of MPs hold outside interests which would be considered within ‘reasonable limits’. “However, where a small number of individuals have taken up outside interests beyond what might be considered reasonable, it risks undermining trust in Parliament and parliamentarians. “We are therefore recommending a package of important reforms to address issues concerning MPs’ capacity to fulfil their parliamentary duties and responsibilities to their constituents and to mitigate the potential for undue influence on our political system. “To demonstrate high standards, Parliament needs to be more transparent with the public about the registration and declaration of interests.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mps cheeky england world cup","story":"NewsMP\u0027s cheeky England World Cup-themed Brexit ad lands him in hot water with the FATonight\u0027s clash with Colombia has already sent the nation into World Cup fever.

And it seems one MP may have got a tad over-exuberant.  Gareth Thomas earned himself a yellow card from the Football Association after he seized on another Gareth in a tongue-in-cheek Brexit fight.  The Labour MP tweeted an light-hearted image of England manager Gareth Southgate, below the words: Make sure you get your MP to back Gareth this July!. Only in smaller font did he mention it was actually about his bid to give people a second Brexit referendum. After what sources described as a stern phone call from a senior FA official, the image was removed from the MP\u0027s Twitter account last night.  Mr Thomas admitted: The image on my Twitter was only meant as a bit of fun to promote my People\u0027s Vote Bill this Friday. But the FA weren\u0027t happy with it so we took it down immediately. We don\u0027t want to tease the FA.  Mr Thomas has a Private Member\u0027s Bill before Parliament this Friday, which would force the government to grant a public vote on its withdrawal agreement with the EU. A string of Remain-backing Labour MPs have thrown their weight behind a so-called \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027. But it is not Labour policy and the Bill is so far down the Commons \u0027order paper\u0027 that it will not even be debated on Friday. It is likely to be postponed until October 26 but may not be debated then either.

There’s lots to celebrate because we can be proud the UK is a world leader in LGBT rights. But I know that, in 2018, many LGBT people still have to deal with discrimination, hatred and even violence and I’m determined to do something about it. Last year we launched the first national LGBT survey which attracted more than 108,000 responses, making it the largest survey of its kind anywhere in the world. Some of the findings make for difficult reading. I was shocked to learn that two-thirds of people avoid holding hands in public with same-sex partners for fear of a negative reaction.  That so many people fear the consequences of this simple gesture shows that a society in which we are all treated equally and fairly is still some way off. Two in five of the people surveyed had experienced verbal harassment or physical violence simply because of their sexuality. Worse still, 90% of those people felt they couldn’t report it because “it happens all the time”. It’s for reasons such as these that we’re publishing our LGBT Action Plan, setting out the concrete steps to help improve lives for LGBT people and eliminate the discrimination and inequality they face. We are going to appoint a national adviser on health inequalities, so the specific needs of LGBT people are at the heart of the NHS. We will continue our investment in programmes to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying in schools, protecting LGBT students and confronting hatred in all its forms.

The body of the six-year-old was discovered by police in woods on the grounds of a derelict hotel at around 9am yesterday, two and half hours after she was reported missing. Alesha was staying with her dad and gran at their home in Rothesay, Isle of Bute, when the alarm was raised. Her mother Georgina Genie Lochrane, 23, found out the heartbreaking news about her daughter after Alesha\u0027s grandmother posted an appeal on Facebook .  Genie has since been escorted by police from her home and taken to the island yesterday afternoon. Formal identification is yet to take place but it is believed to be that of the six-year-old. As police continue their investigation, they are recording the details of every ferry passenger travelling to and from the island, the Daily Record reports. Alesha\u0027s relatives from Coatbridge said they are shocked by the tragedy. Alan McGuire confirmed that the youngster was visiting her gran on Bute when the tragedy happened. Alan said: “Alesha would go to Bute quite often to visit her gran and this was just a regular visit.  “We are devastated about what has happened because she was a lovely wee girl. “At the moment we simply don’t know what is happening. We are waiting to hear if the police are treating it as suspicious or as a tragic accident.” His partner Lisamarie said: “I don’t want to say too much because we don’t know many facts. She was a lovely girl and this has been a shock.” Another relative said: “The family have had a lot of heartbreak in recent years but this is unbearable. “The police are investigating and at this stage we don’t know if this is an accident or something even worse.” Alesha was a pupil at Chapelside Primary School in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire and head teacher Wendy Davie paid tribute to her this morning.   She said: Alesha started with us at Chapelside Primary in August 2016 and had just finished primary two. She loved being at school and enjoyed all aspects of literacy, in particular writing. She was such a perfectionist in her handwriting and was very proud of her work. Alesha was very friendly and she welcomed everyone first thing in the morning at breakfast club. She was a very considerate child who loved being part of a group and she was popular with all the other children, and was a smiley and happy young girl. She was part of the family of Chapelside Primary and she will be greatly missed by everyone at the school. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and Chapelside Primary community at this very sad time. The area surrounding Alesha’s gran’s home, around half a mile from the spot where her body was found, was sealed off by police tape, with an officer standing guard at the cordon. The scene itself where Alesha’s body was discovered was concealed by thick foliage. A small clearing in the shrubs, which appeared to be an entrance to the grounds of the former hotel, was also taped off. Detective Superintendent Stuart Houston from Police Scotland’s Major Investigation Teams said: “This death of a 6 year old child has shocked the tight knit community of Rothesay and it is imperative that we find out what has happened.

The Met Office has forecast highs up to 33C this week and 35C next week - after eight days in a row already at between 29C and 33C. And the heat is forecast to remain through the second half of July and August, computer models show. Britain is hotter than 29C Barbados. The famous 1976 summer saw standpipes on the street as Britain sweltered. The heatwave has left Brits feeling uncomfortably hot with many people saying they have struggled to sleep.  Why is it so hot? High pressure over the UK is causing high levels of sunshine and clear skies. Unlike our usual hot spells that are down to warm air pushing in from the continent, this heatwave is caused by the weather lifting the temperature day on day.    How long will the UK heatwave last? Forecasters say the uncomfortable, sweaty nights show no sign of disappearing. Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said: “There’s no sign of an end to the heat. Warmth looks like continuing for the first half of July. And forecast models point to above-average temperatures for much of July and August.” What areas will it affect? Thursday looks like the peak of this week\u0027s heat, with the hottest areas in the west, while the eastern coast getting fresher weather.  Highs of 30C are expected on Thursday, with the North West getting a high of 31C.  Northern Scotland may get cooler by Thursday, while the South and West of England will remain hot through to the weekend.    When will it rain? The Met Office has issued a weather warning for thunderstorms - the first such advisory since the service was introduced. Helen Roberts added: “This week could see 33C in the second half of the week, and next week looks much like last week and could come close to 35C. “Lots of very warm, dry, sunny and settled weather is ahead, and humid nights mean it will be difficult to sleep.”  When was it last this hot? The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Parallels with the famous 1976 summer can be made. Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weather trending said: “Hot and dry weather breeds hot and dry weather. This effect was seen in 1976. This spell ending seems increasingly unlikely through the first half of July.” Metweather forecaster Jo Farrow Paul Michael White said: “The storms are no breakdown as the heatwave will keep on cooking.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum told baby girl 50","story":"NewsMum-to-be told baby girl has 50% chance of death after intestine and spleen move into her chest weeks before birthEXCLUSIVE: Heavily-pregnant Marlo Rankin panicked and struggled to hold back tears when she was told her daughter Mabel might die due to a rare condition\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter08:03, 3 JUL 2018NewsMabel fought for life on a ventilator in hospital (Image: Marlo Rankin/Mirrorpix)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA horrified mum-to-be was told her unborn baby girl had a 50% chance of death after her intestine and spleen moved into her chest weeks before her birth. Heavily-pregnant Marlo Rankin, 40, panicked and struggled to hold back tears when she was told her daughter Mabel had a rare condition which could kill her. After a \u0027normal\u0027 33 weeks of pregnancy, she was left unsure whether Mabel would live or die after the infant\u0027s organs shifted into her chest while she was in the womb. The mum and her partner Jeff Bush, 42, were told their daughter\u0027s organs were restricting the growth of her left lung - and that her heart had also grown on the wrong side of her body. At 34 weeks pregnant, Jeff and I were devastated to find out that our baby had a 50% chance of survival, Marlo told . Hearing the \u002750/50\u0027 was a shock and a constant reminder that either side was possible. The weeks leading up to her birth were the most terrifying of our lives.  There were no guarantees that she’d survive. It was hard trying to stay positive, knowing the reality that we could have lost her.  Little Mabel was diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( CDH ), a condition where a hole in the diaphragm results in the intestines - and sometime the stomach - entering the chest cavity and preventing lung growth. In the lead-up to the birth, and the weeks that followed, Marlo said the world just stopped as she and Jeff desperately hoped their precious girl would make it. She described the time as your worst nightmare full of shock, fear and heartbreak as they worried about the worst case scenario - losing their child. She also said watching their daughter struggle for life while hooked up to tubes was the darkest moment of your life, because you have no control. But Mabel, a fighter from the start, defied the odds and has recently celebrated her first birthday - an occasion which will forever be emotional for the family because of what they went through.  Marlo, from Upminster in Essex, said that everything was completely normal with her pregnancy until 34 weeks. The agro business economist for the UN was sent for a routine growth scan at Queen\u0027s Hospital, Romford, in January 2017. But the scan showed something was wrong. Her heart was pushed to the other side of the body, on the right, Marlo said. There was a hole in her diaphragm, which usually separates the lower intestine and spleen from the lungs. The mum was told the hole meant those organs were able to move to the chest cavity, preventing the lungs from developing.  I was panicked, terrified and in tears, trying to get hold of Jeff who hadn\u0027t come with me because we thought it was just a routine appointment, she said. Mabel was our second child and we had no problems with Joey. The whole world stops when that assumption (that there\u0027d also be no problems) goes out the window. It was horrifying. It\u0027s your worst nightmare. You\u0027re under the assumption everything is fine and you are growing a healthy baby - especially that far into the pregnancy.  Marlo said she phoned Jeff crying, telling him you have to come, something is wrong with the baby, prompting the dad-to-be to also break out into tears. Doctors told Marlo her baby needed to be seen by a neo-natal specialist. They waited an hour and a half for the specialist, but Marlo said it felt like forever. The worst case scenario goes through your mind that we might no longer have a healthy baby, and we don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong, she said.  Marlo and Jeff were told their baby had a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, the cause of which is unknown and occurs in about one in 2000 babies. The couple had never heard of the condition and didn\u0027t know anyone who had. Marlo said the consultant told them their baby\u0027s right lung was developing but the left lung was smaller. They were advised their baby would have to be born somewhere with the highest level of care for infants. Marlo said the consultant told them babies that do survive tend to catch up, but that the early years can be complex. She described her and Jeff going for a coffee after hearing the news, saying: We were both crying and thinking \u0027what will it mean?\u0027 We were thinking of the worst case scenario, that we would lose our baby. Or if it did survive, would it have a disability? We didn\u0027t know. It was a lot of shock and fear.  The next stage was a referral to the King\u0027s College Medical Institute for more detailed scans to determine exactly which organs had moved. It was just a few days until the parents had their appointment, but Marlo said the weekend felt like an eternity. She considered how it would affect their little three-year-old boy, Joey, and all of them as a family. And while they waited for things to become clearer, Mabel kicked so much, she was trying to tell us she was strong, Marlo said. She added: Jeff and I were a really good team. We would both talk to her and say how strong she was. The day of the appointment at King\u0027s was one of the most difficult and exhausting days of Marlo\u0027s life, full of scans and blood tests. Marlo said a consultant spoke to them and said \u0027do you know what the condition is\u0027 and \u0027do you know what the odds are, there is a 50/50 chance of survival most of the time\u0027.  The parents were told that in their case the odds were better, and their baby had a 67% chance of living. But they were warned it would be difficult to tell what would happen until their baby was born. They said as far as they could tell the heart was functioning, but the lower intestine and spleen had moved into the chest cavity and was restricting the growth of the lungs, Marlo said. The left lung had not been able to grow to its normal size. Marlo said a consultant explained to her that she would need to give birth in a special neo-natal unit and that she would be induced. Tests also ruled out genetic abnormalities and Down\u0027s Syndrome at this stage. Speaking about how she felt, Marlo said: We were exhausted but trying to be hopeful that the odds were in our favour. We were trying to stay positive but there\u0027s that fear and that heartbreak. There are people out there in the same situation whose babies didn\u0027t get a favourable outcome.  A week later, they were at the Royal London Hospital where scans confirmed Mabel\u0027s lung had now developed to a reasonable level. They found out the sex of the baby, and Marlo said knowing helped her feel more connected. But being showed around the neo-natal unit was an extremely challenging moment for the mum. You just see babies hooked up to machines, looking helpless and alone, she described. For Jeff it was reassuring because you could see the high level of care they were getting, but for me it was distressing. When the time came for Marlo to be induced at 38 weeks, she got to hold her baby just briefly before Mabel was immediately taken away to be intubated. She was crying and she was pink - and we were thrilled, Marlo told. At least she had enough lung capacity that she could do that. It was an incredible moment and felt like the best start for her. I was in a state of euphoria that she\u0027d been born that the shock of her being taken away didn\u0027t hit until later. Jeff went with Mabel while Marlo was being cared for and sent her photos of their new baby to show she was doing OK. She was lying there, a tiny little thing with all those wires, Marlo said.  But they were constantly reassured and given updates by the team at the Royal London Hospital, who were phenomenal. Nearly four hours after Mabel was born on March 1, 2017, Marlo was finally able to go and see her. She said initially their newborn appeared to be quite strong, but sadly her condition deteriorated throughout the day. The first 24 hours can be critical, Marlo was told, and Mabel was having a lot of trouble breathing. Marlo said: At 15 hours old, one of the consultants said \u0027it\u0027s not looking good\u0027. They were struggling to stabilise her and weren\u0027t sure she was going to make it. I said \u0027what else, what else can you do\u0027. She was struggling for life. There was a team of about 10 people around her helping her. I was so exhausted from the trauma. I remember the two of us sitting, crying, and just hoping she would make it through the night.  It took about 10 days for Mabel to be strong enough for surgery and Marlo described surgeons cutting 3cm on a tiny little body. The operation on March 10 was to move the organs that had gone into the chest cavity and close the hole in her diaphragm so her left lung could develop. Her heart had naturally moved back into its correct position on the left side of the body. Before surgery, we said goodbye to her and prepared ourselves for the worst, Marlo told. But three hours later the surgeon said everything went well. It was a rollercoaster. Although she had been weaned off the sedation, Mabel didn\u0027t wake up until April 1 and doctors couldn\u0027t work out why. Her mum would sit by her bedside everyday holding her little hands and doctors\u0027 advice would be she\u0027s fragile but she\u0027s stable. She even became known as stable Mabel. I\u0027d read and sing to her but it was just so sad, Marlo said. I felt all along that she knew I was there.  While Mabel was in hospital in London, her family was offered free accommodation run by The Sick Children\u0027s Trust and the family were overwhelmed by the kindness the charity offered them.   Marlo said: The Sick Children\u0027s Trust were a life saver for us. Mabel was in hospital for three months overall, in London for nine weeks. For that entire nine week period we had a room provided by the Sick Children\u0027s Trust that was big enough for our little boy to stay with us as well. It meant we were always able to be there with her at her bedside, she was never on her own. On April 7 doctors performed another procedure to drain fluid found in Mabel\u0027s chest that was making it impossible for her to breathe on her own. After this procedure she lifted her arms above her head for the first time, a sign she was going to be OK. She started improving rapidly and was eventually able to be taken off her ventilator and given nasal oxygen by the middle of the month. Then when she was eight weeks old, on April 23, Marlo walked in to see her little girl in her cot breathing on her own.

Bailey Smyth-Osborne was said to have been subjected to \u0027more than one\u0027 blunt impact of mild to moderate force, as well as a yanking and twisting motion to his left limb. His penis may also have been pinched, and any trauma he suffered went beyond rough-handling, a jury was told. It is alleged one of his parents, Marina Smyth or Michael Osborne, caused the injuries while the other was aware and failed to protect him. Bailey was just three weeks old when the young couple found him stiff, cold and not breathing in his Moses basket next to their bed at their flat in Tonbridge, Kent, on December 5, 2016.  Despite desperate resuscitation attempts by both Osborne and paramedics, Bailey could not be revived. But a court heard that although cause of death was later recorded as a result of pneumonia, sepsis and a cold-like virus, other injuries were discovered by doctors which caused concern. These included a 5cm long bruise to the right-hand side of his head, bruising and swelling to his penis, and bruising across the middle joints of three of his fingers. Bailey also had bruises to his thumb, left elbow, left ankle and right heel, and \u0027quite intense\u0027 bleeding under his scalp. Prosecutor Jennifer Knight told Maidstone Crown Court in Kent on Monday: The head injuries found are consistent with more than one blunt impact of mild to moderate force. Any bruising to a young baby who is not yet mobile, without explanation is a cause of concern, particularly bruising to the penis which raises the possibility of pinching or impact.  Bailey\u0027s \u0027severe\u0027 fractured left tibia was discovered during a CT scan and resulted from \u0027forcible traction\u0027 most likely occurring 24 to 48 hours before he died, added Miss Knight. The kind of fracture caused by pulling with a twisting motion, a twist or yanking, injury...a very distinctive kind of fracture typically seen in non-accidental injury, she explained. Both the bruising and fracturing indicated a level of trauma beyond rough handling of Bailey and in-keeping with physical assault of Bailey in the period leading up to death. Smyth, 21, of Oxford Gardens, Maidstone, and Osborne, 22, of Bybrook Road, Kennington, Ashford, Kent, deny causing or allowing serious physical harm to a child between November 16 and December 6, 2016. The jury of seven women and five men was told the prosecution does not have to prove which parent inflicted the injuries. But Miss Knight said whichever defendant was not responsible would have still been aware of the significant risk posed to their child. It is the Crown\u0027s case that one of these two defendants was responsible for Bailey\u0027s injuries and the other, though not the actual perpetrator, allowed them to occur by failing to take responsible steps to protect Bailey from a risk of injury which should have been foreseen, she added. The court heard Osborne and Smyth met as teenagers. They lived together in Walters Farm Road and Bailey was born healthy and without complications on November 16, 2016.  He was discharged with his mum that same day and other than being diagnosed with oral thrush at two weeks\u0027 old, for which he was prescribed drops and then gel, was well. Bailey was also described as appearing \u0027well and content\u0027 at a family birthday party on December 3, just two days before he died. The court heard the couple would take it in turns to care for their son during the night and he had last been fed by Smyth at 12.30am on December 5. A neighbour later told police that he had heard a baby crying at about 1am. Jacob Nash said he went to his balcony window to listen and could hear a high-pitched cry that he thought was unusual and lasted quite a long time, maybe 20 to 25 minutes, said Miss Knight. But Smyth told police she had not heard any crying and it was not until she woke at 10am that she discovered her son was unresponsive. Having handed him to Osborne, she then telephoned her mum, crying and saying Bailey was not breathing. But it was another 45 minutes before Smyth dialled 999, the court heard. When an emergency first responder arrived just four minutes later he noticed Bailey was unconscious, grey in colour, with a stiff chest and jaw, and arms and legs which were cool to the touch. Osborne was giving him CPR under the instruction of the ambulance control centre operator. Paramedics took over but the court was told by 11am it was decided the newborn had been dead \u0027for some time\u0027 and any further attempts to resuscitate him would be futile. However, having been taken to Pembury Hospital, doctors immediately noticed bruising to his head and penis, the court heard.  His further injuries were then discovered during a post-mortem examination. Smyth and Osborne were arrested and twice interviewed by police. Both denied either being responsible for, or aware of, their son\u0027s injuries. Marina Smyth had no explanation for them. She could think of no occasion where she or Michael Osborne had ever handled Bailey in a way that might have caused his leg injury, said Miss Knight. She said he always cried when he was undressed or had his nappy changed but she had not noticed any crying that was unusual. Marina Smyth said she did not remember seeing any bruising to Bailey\u0027s penis and could not think of any reason why he would have bruising to his fingers, the head or the impacts to the top of his head. Smyth said she had fed and put her baby to sleep in his Moses basket, and did not notice any crying during the night. She then found Bailey unresponsive the next morning, gave him to Osborne and dialled 999. Asked about her relationship with Osborne, Smyth told police he would get \u0027stressed out\u0027 and described a couple of occasions when he woke her during the night because he was agitated and struggling to get their son back to sleep.

Little Katie Wallace has for the first time been able to speak to her sister and school friends - and she owes it to a trip abroad. The eight-year-old\u0027s crippling anxiety and selective mutism meant she would clam up around others, but she has always been able to speak to her dad. However, a once in a lifetime charity trip to Tenerife in May this year left Katie so excited and carefree she was soon chatting and getting involved with others. Katie and her dad Fin went on the incredible holiday thanks to money raised by local Lancashire charity, Days of Sunshine.  The charity takes local children away throughout the year and believed Katie - who had never been out of the country before - would really benefit from a fun trip in the sunshine. Speaking of Katie’s incredible progress single dad Fin, 52, said: “She’s a different child, I can’t believe it. “When I say she was silent, she was completely mute for seven years. “I can’t believe how much of a difference the holiday has made. I can’t pinpoint exactly what made the difference I think it was a mixture of everything. “A new place, amazing activities and new friends that she felt comfortable with, I don’t even think she realised she’d started to interact.  “She was just too excited and loving life, it was incredible to see. “It’s quite a journey we have been on and it feels like this has been a miracle holiday.” Katie was diagnosed with selective mutism - a severe anxiety disorder - when she was just four years old leaving her unable to speak to anyone except her dad. Miraculously she is now able to speak to her teacher, albeit not in front of the class, and she is able to chat with school pals and her big sister Emma Wallace, 28. Fin, from St Annes, Lancs., believes a lot of Katie’s anxieties are down to her early childhood before he took over her full-time care when she was two.  He said: “She’s already been through so much, she\u0027s such a delicate little thing and I just want the best for her. “I can’t begin to tell you how awful it was, she would suffer in silence if I wasn’t around not telling anyone if she felt poorly or was in pain. “She didn’t show expressions either, a clown could run into the classroom and she would not flinch.” Finn was starting to feel helpless and was worried Katie would continue to suffer from her selective muteness for the rest of her life. He said: “No one knew how to help, the school did their best but all you know is what you read on the internet. “She had a speech therapist but I didn’t think that would help as her speech itself is fine, she is very articulate when she talks to me.”  Fin, who is unemployed after having a heart attack and being diagnosed with cancer in 2015, said it was distressing for Katie when he was in the hospital. He said: “I was in the hospital for two weeks and Katie had to stay with her big sister Emma while I was recovering. “I can’t even begin to imagine how scared she must have been as it was the first time we had been apart and she knew I wasn’t very well. “She must have felt so lonely not speaking to anyone for so long. “It is incredible the change in her in the last month, I am so grateful to the charity - they have changed our lives beyond words.

The 18-year-old woman was on her way to lodge the bookie\u0027s earnings in the Post Office when she was set upon by the thug. Dash-cam footage captured by a passing driver shows a man in a white hoodie snatching the money before fleeing the scene. The video was released by Hertfordshire Police on Monday as they appealed for information on the theft that took place in Hatfield, Herts. Police are also appealing for information about a second man who threatened the teenager before they made off with the shop\u0027s takings.  The motorist who filmed the ordeal comforted the victim before taking her back to the Ladbrokes. Detective Constable Andrew Greenman said: We are grateful to the member of the public who has shared their footage with us after being in the right place at the right time. We are following several lines of inquiry at this stage, one of which is appealing to the public to ask if they recognise the man pictured. I want to reassure the victim that we are doing all we can to capture those responsible.  A spokesman for Hertfordshire Police said: Officers investigating a robbery in Hatfield have released dash cam footage of the offence in progress, as well as still images, in order to identify the two suspects. It happened in Wellfield Road, Hatfield, at 2.10pm on June 25. The victim, an 18-year-old woman, works at Ladbrokes in Birchwood and had left the branch with a large quantity of the store\u0027s cash takings in a bag, with the intention of banking it at a Post Office in the town centre.

People on board included pregnant women and mothers with young children who began to \u0027melt\u0027 as the air conditioning unit failed and temperatures soared to as high as 40C, it was claimed. One person even suffered a panic attack, a witness said. Flight MH1805 was expected to depart from Zante, Greece, for London Stansted airport at 2pm on Sunday. Travellers say they were originally told the plane needed to be refueled resulting in an initial one hour delay to the flight. They were then trapped inside for three hours without adequate water supplies resulting in many passing out and throwing up.  Kerry Shippey said: “Nobody minds a delay, things happen, but keeping people in a tin can in 40 degree heat so that people are passing out and throwing up is taking things a little far don’t you think?” Dan Chapman, 22, told the Mirror: “It was very dangerous as there were some very old and pregnant women, as well as babies on board. “Two people passed out and an ambulance had to be sent out for them. “It is illegal to treat animals like this let alone people. “People were very agitated after we were refused from exiting the plane for reasons I am unsure about. I\u0027ve also lost a days work today, as have many others. “It was easily the most uncomfortable experience of my life.”  An 18-year-old travelling abroad for the first time with a group of friends, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “There were only six bottles of water given out to the whole plane, which were supposedly meant for the cabin crew and passengers. Once this had run out cabin crew melted down ice for extra supplies. “I saw one young woman around the age of 17 suffered a panic attack and needed oxygen and was taken away in an ambulance. “I was travelling with a group of nine 18-year-old girls and it was our first time travelling on our own for all of us. It was fairly traumatic and stressful for all involved.  Videos posted online showed restless passengers dripped with sweat and fanning themselves with safety instruction cards. The nightmare continued off the plane, as exhausted passengers were finally sent to hotels after the flight was eventually cancelled. Another holidaymaker told us how she “arrived at our accommodation to find cockroaches on the walls.” She added: “We were told a transfer would pick us up from the hotel at 6am but this didn’t arrive. “We later found out that us and another hotel down the road had been forgotten about. We finally boarded the plane home, 12 hours later.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have kept quiet on who they are going to name as godparents for their youngest child. But bookies are backing close confidants, like the couple\u0027s outgoing private secretaries Miguel Head and Rebecca Priestley, rather than family members. Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: It\u0027s looking increasingly likely the Duke and Duchess will turn to trusted aides over family members.  Here are the latest odds on who could be Prince Louis \u0027 godparents...   Favourite to be named as godfather is Miguel Head, Prince William\u0027s outgoing private secretary. He has been with the Royal Family for more than ten years, and took over as private secretary for the Duke in 2013.  He is due to leave his role this month, and will be replaced by Simon Case, a top civil servant in the government\u0027s Brexit department.  Tiggy Legge-Bourke - 2/1  Tiggy Legge-Bourke was William and Harry\u0027s nanny, and helped them through the death of their mother Princess Diana in 1997. She left royal service in 1999, but has remained close to the two princes. William is reportedly the godfather to her son, Tom.   Laura Lopes is the daughter of William\u0027s stepmother Camilla, from her first marriage to Andrew Parker-Bowles.  Her 10-year-old daughter Eliza was one of Kate\u0027s bridesmaids when she married William in 2011. Rebecca Priestley - 4/1  As well as William\u0027s top aide Miguel Head, Kate\u0027s former private secretary Rebecca Priestley is a favourite to be made godparent. The duchess\u0027 aide was with her since 2013, and was on hand to help Kate out during the first six years of her marriage. But she stepped down from the role last year, and is now director of a consultancy firm. David Jardine-Paterson - 5/1  David Jardine-Paterson went to Eton at the same time as Prince William, and later married one of his friends. His wife, Emilia Jardine-Paterson, is god-mother to Prince George. His younger brother, JJ Jardine-Paterson, dated Kate\u0027s sister Pippa for four years.  Hugh van Cutsem jr is the son of Prince Charles\u0027 best friend from school. The four van Cutsem brothers have been close to William and Harry since childhood. Hugh\u0027s 11-year-old daughter Grace van Cutsem is Prince William\u0027s god-daughter, and was a bridesmaid at the Duke and Duchess\u0027 wedding. She became famous after being pictured with her hands over her ears when the newlyweds appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony. Other favourites  The older sisters of William\u0027s mum Princess Diana - Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McQuodale - both have odds of 6/1. Captain Mark Dyer, a close family friend often said to be a second father-figure to Prince William, has odds of 6/1. Meanwhile William\u0027s cousins Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie both have odds of 7/1. Who didn\u0027t make the top of the list   Prince Harry\u0027s new wife Meghan Markle is way down the list of favourites, at 14/1.  Although the new Duchess of Sussex is close to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgem it\u0027s not seen as likely that she\u0027ll be made a godparent. This is because the royals still follow a pattern of choosing close friends and even former members of staff, and Meghan falls outside that category.  The same goes for Louis\u0027 uncle Prince Harry and his auntie Pippa Middleton , who at 10/1 are both a bit of a long-shot. Kate and Pippa\u0027s brother James Middleton is also in at 10/1.  And for those interested, Donald Trump has odds of 1000/1.   Prince George has seven godparents, including Earl Grosvenor - one of the wealthiest men in the country.   He also has fellow-royal Zara Tindall , Prince William\u0027s cousin, and Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton , William\u0027s former private secretary.   His other godparents are William and Kate\u0027s pals Oliver Baker , William van Cutsem and Emilia Jardine-Paterson , as well as a friend of Princess Diana, Julia Samuel .

Lewis Mundy and Kimberley Floyd, both 27, excitedly boarded a TUI flight to Greece and tucked their passports into the magazine pocket of their seats. But after stepping off the jet they realised they did not have the documents. They instantly tried to backtrack, but were told they couldn\u0027t re-board. Instead a member of staff conducted a search but quickly emerged to say they could not be found. The couple pleaded with airline employees to have another look and gave detailed instructions about where the passports were, but still they could not be found.  They were then refused entry the country and were sent packing on a return flight to the UK within 30 minutes. Lewis and Kimberly, both from Portsmouth, were unable to fly back out on another date and had to forfeit the \u0026pound1,400 holiday. Lewis, who owns his own groundworks company, described it as the biggest nightmare you could imagine. He said: We boarded the plane to go to Greece, it was very exciting. We sat to watch a film and chilled out on the plane to pass the time. We were supposed to be sunning it up in Greece but instead ended up at Stansted. There\u0027s no sign of our passports and we\u0027ve had no help, no compensation, nothing. We\u0027ve done everything we could but no one seems to care. It was a nightmare, the biggest you could imagine.  The couple booked their week-long holiday to the five star Atki Hotel on the island of Kos with First Choice and flew out on a TUI jet from Gatwick in June. Kimberley told how people looked at them like they were criminals as they waited. She said: I realised as soon as we got off the plane, it could only have been two minutes tops. They told us we couldn\u0027t get back on the plane and the made us wait by the door to the airport while someone went to look but they said there was nothing there.  We had people around us making sure we didn\u0027t leave. We were waiting for about 30 minutes for a flight back, we had to wait by the door. They tried to move us somewhere else but I refused. There was people watching us like we were criminals. After waiting for between 30 and 40 minutes the couple were put on the next flight back to the UK, and endured another four hour flight. Kimberley added: They didn\u0027t care, they gave us a boarding pass and chucked us on the next flight, we didn\u0027t get a choice - it was disgusting.

Little Reginald Fields was hoping to raise cash for candy over the summer, so set up Mr Reggie\u0027s Lawn Cutting Service alongside his siblings and cousins. And they began doing odd gardening jobs in the Ohio neighbourhood. But when the 12-year-old and his team unintentionally cut some grass on a neighbour\u0027s property the police were called over the \u0027trespassing.\u0027 Cops arrived to the shock of other residents.  “If they would have been four white children, the police would not have been called,” said neighbour Lucille Holt-Colden who filmed the children\u0027s hard work.

Reggie was left so disheartened by the drama he considered throwing in the towel and calling it a day. However, Reggie\u0027s plight has been met with an outpouring of support and money which has given him the encouragement to carry on - and now his business is booming with requests for his services. More than $36,000 has been raised over the last two days through a GoFundMe page , which initially had a target of $1,000.  Reggie is hoping to use the money to buy new equipment. Just give me a call. I will be there. On time! he said. He\u0027s even set up a business page which has been flooded with comments calling him an inspiration and saying he has a bright future ahead of him.

He wants to do it all. He said something about opening up a store that sells parts, she added. He has his mind set.

Lee Ann Jarrell spent an hour perfecting her look on the maternity ward - even contouring while having contractions - and only paused when the pain became too severe. The 22-year-old has defended her decision to film herself applying make-up in her hospital bed before 8lb 2oz Olivia arrived. Instead of making her look vain, she insists the video would show her daughter, now six months, the importance of loving yourself enough to want to look good.  Lee Ann, of Mandeville, Louisiana in the US, said: I just wanted to look glamorous in the pictures of me giving birth - to look picture perfect. “Even if I was sweating, I knew if I saw myself in the mirror, I would think, ‘You look good\u0027. Before the birth on December 14 last year, Lee Ann could never leave the home she shares with her lawyer husband David Jarrell, 36, without make-up on.  She also got up at 5am every day to put her face on, conducting her two-hour regime before her husband woke. Lee Ann, who uses a 14-step make-up regime, said: “I felt ugly without it. I would worry when we were out that my make-up might wear off, too, so I\u0027d try not to sweat or sometimes even smile, to make it last longer.” Even though David insisted she looked gorgeous bare-faced, she refused to believe him.  She added: “He said I was beautiful the way I was and didn’t need to cover up all the time, but I felt a real pressure from girls looking so perfect on social media to look the same.” Hours before being induced at 2am at St. Tammany Parish Hospital in Covington, Louisiana, Lee Ann started on her eyebrows at home. She said: They always have to be asymmetric and just perfect. Afterwards I packed my make-up bag, laden with 20 brushes and all the products I needed to get me looking good.  And at 4am she got to work on her delivery look. Lee Ann, who was a week past her due date, said: “Some people did look at me like I was doing something wrong. But I got my mirror and camera out and began. I wanted to create a natural look and it was a good way to distract me from the painful contractions which had started, too.” Then Lee Ann, who is originally from the Philippines, embarked on her intricate 14 step make-up regime.  Starting with primer, she then applied foundation, followed by concealer, setting powder and face powder. Then she sculpted her cheekbones by contouring, before applying blusher, a highlighter and creating a smoky-eye, using eyeshadows, then applying mascara, lip-liner, lipstick, more setting powder and finally additional face powder. The mum, who met her husband online nearly five years ago, said: “David was sat beside me holding my hand the whole time, telling me I looked great and it was going to be ok. “I kept having contractions throughout and even had to pause doing my make-up on the video, while I dealt with the pain.  Birth is a beautiful thing for a woman, the most natural thing in the world, but there is nothing wrong with wanting to look good yourself, wanting to add some sparkle. Finally, an hour after she completed the look, Lee Ann’s waters broke and she gave birth to Olivia at 12.44pm. Ironically, despite her insistence on having flawless make-up during labour, after her daughter was born, Lee Ann finally learned to love her natural face. She said: “I realised I should be confident being natural and bare-faced.

Sometimes, no matter what you do, you\u0027ll never be good enough for your partner\u0027s parents. You can be the best husband/wife in the world, but that won\u0027t stop them criticising every little thing you do. One wife found out the hard way what her husband\u0027s family really thought of her after discovering a string of cruel messages which accused her of ruining the last holiday by suffering epileptic fits. The woman was abroad with her husband, five-year-old son and mother-in-law at the time.  She revealed all in an anonymous post online. On holiday with in-laws and I have no signal on my phone so I borrowed mother-in-law\u0027s phone to ring my mum as it\u0027s her birthday, she wrote. As she was about to make the call, a message from her sister-in-law popped up. It said: I am glad the stupid b**** is not spoiling it this year for you all. Wanting to know what the message was about, the woman decided to check more of the texts.  Only to find some \u0027horrid\u0027 things. She continued: So wanting to know what this was about I did check mother-in-law\u0027s messages only to find many messages saying \u0027thank god the fits have stayed away this year\u0027 and \u0027the lazy cow is pulling her weight this year\u0027. Then messages back saying \u0027it\u0027s his fault he knew when he married her she had them\u0027 and \u0027don\u0027t know how he puts up with her\u0027.  The woman, who posts on MumsNet as Raspberryberetthekindyoufind, then went on to explain the back story of their previous holiday.  Last year we went away and I had quite a few seizures (I am epileptic) and for two days I was completely floored and was told by husband to either sleep inside or just stay on the sunbed.  After finding the messages, the woman was understandably left feeling hurt and unsure of what to do next. If the message had not popped up, I would never have checked her phone. I don\u0027t know what to do, I felt so guilty last year and mother-in-law and father-in-law kept saying \u0027it\u0027s ok\u0027 I don\u0027t know if I should say something now, tell my husband, wait until we get home or just leave it. Other mums were quick to call out the mother and sister-in-law.  One said: What a pair of witches! Another commented: I would absolutely tell your husband and see what he wants to do about it. I wouldn\u0027t be going on holiday with them again. A third added: If my mum did that to my spouse, I would be packing up and leaving.

The 12 boys and their football coach were found alive at the bottom of the cave on Monday, following a nine-day ordeal. But the group will have to bear their ordeal for longer while rescuers work out how to bring them safely out, the governor of Chiang Rai province said on Tuesday. The youngsters, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach, disappeared after going on a hiking trip in the cave shortly before it was hit by flash-flooding, leaving them trapped underground. Nearly 900 soldiers and emergency personnel, including elite military divers and British rescue workers, were called in to find the children. The boys appeared nervous and frightened as they are discovered by the rescue team. A video shot by rescuers in flickering torchlight revealed boys clad in shorts and red and blue shirts sitting or standing on the rock above an expanse of water .  How many of you are there - 13? Brilliant, a British diver tells the youngsters. You have been here 10 days. You are very strong. Thank you, one of the boys says. One of the boys asks when they will get out of the cave, to which the rescuer answers: Not today. You have to dive. Two British divers, John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, were first to reach the boys, having had strong experience in cave rescues, according to Bill Whitehouse, the vice chairman of the British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC).  They found the group along with a team of Thai navy SEAL divers. Rescuers had been focusing on an elevated mound, which cavers have named Pattaya Beach, in the cave complex\u0027s third chamber, knowing that it could have provided the boys with a refuge when rains flooded the cave. The SEALs reported that ... they reached Pattaya Beach which was flooded. So they went 400 metres further where we found the 13 ... who were safe, Narongsak told the cheering group of reporters.  Rescuers now have to decide how best to get the group out in their weakened condition. They have been given energy gels to sustain them while a plan is worked out to bring them to safety. Options considered included waiting until water levels subsided, or teaching the group to use diving gear to navigate the flooded cave. If you ask me now while we are still assessing all sides then I don\u0027t think they will be home soon, Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters.  The group\u0027s health was assessed overnight by medical teams which will continue to check the health of the group on Monday, said Narongsak, explaining that the boys had sustained light injuries. We categorized their health condition as red, yellow or green, red being the most severe injuries, yellow being mild and green being light. Yesterday, unofficially, we assessed that most are in the green category, said Narongsak. Narongsak said rescue workers would now focus on the rescue phase and then a handover to medical teams waiting outside the cave.  The children vanished with their coach a week ago on Saturday. They are: Chanin Wiboonroongrueng, 11, Duangphet Promthep, age unknown, Phornchid Kamluang, 16, Prachuck Sutham, 14, Somphong Jaiwong, 13, Peerapat Sompiengjai, 16, Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 14, Panumart Saengdee, age unknown, Pipat Phothai, 15, Nattawoot Thakamsai, 14, Adul Samon, 14, Mongkol Boonpium, 13, and coack Ekkapol Chantawong, 25.  The youngsters, from the Wild Boars football team, were later seen with beaming smiles in photos taken by military divers who found them. The rescue workers can also be seen cheering and relatives even held a mass prayer session after hearing the good news. The rescue mission began when the boys\u0027 bikes and football boots were found at the mouth of the caves.  The boys were trapped by rising waters inside the cave network deep inside a mountain. Thai Navy seals have found all 13 with signs of life, regional governor Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters. For around half a mile, the cave is wide open with spectacular limestone rock formations.  But deeper in, the the network narrows and signs warn visitors not to venture further during the rainy season, which usually begins in July, because it is prone to flooding. A national park ranger alerted authorities when he found their footwear and bikes near the entrance to the cave, but no sign of the children. Thai Navy Seals experts swam three miles into the cave network looking for the children before finding them through a previously murky and inaccessible cavern.

I had always planned to go to the farm to see him but never got round to it so it was amazing that he came to me.“People driving past must have thought I was mad having a donkey in my garden. It was just fantastic – I couldn’t have wished for anything more for my birthday.“We also went out for dinner and visited friends to celebrate but Donkey Bond was an extra special surprise.”Scott said he knew he had to do something special to mark the occasion.“I have been with Sandra for about two and a half years and I was stuck about what to get her for her 50th birthday,” he said.“I was really struggling because she couldn’t tell me anything she wanted and I knew I needed to do something big and a bit different.“My friend’s aunt owns the farm and when we found out there was a donkey being hand-reared in their house because his mother had disowned him, we just thought it was amazing and he was so cute.“Donkey Bond – who is named in honour of James Bond actor Sean Connery – has his own Facebook page and I thought, ‘I wonder if they would bring him to surprise Sandra?’.“We both absolutely love animals anyway and had been following all his social media posts so I knew Sandra would love it.“It was also the first time that Donkey Bond had ever come out for a birthday surprise like this and he was absolutely fantastic.”Scott added: “Sandra is still speaking about it now and I think she will be for the next 10 years.“It really is something for her to remember and I am really glad she liked it.“I also got her a voucher to go up to the farm and walk the alpacas which will be fabulous.“It is even better because I wanted to do it as well so I will able to go along with her.”Nicky said: “Sandra’s reaction when she opened the door was amazing – absolutely brilliant.“Scott got in contact with me because he wanted to do something different for her birthday and he knew my aunt owns Balnuith Farm.“He is a very cute donkey – he lives in the farmhouse kitchen and is toilet-trained like a dog.“There is no chance that Sandra will forget her 50th.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39ef603b912.jpg ","title":"dundee is football crazy i want to earn my shirt says new united keeper siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe mix of ambition and expectation is why Benjamin Siegrist jumped at the chance to up sticks and join Dundee United.The giant Swiss keeper wanted to quit Swiss football for a new challenge and believes the Tangerines tick all the boxes.“Obviously the expectations here are high, but I believe it is good to be part of something when expectations are high,” said the 26-year-old, who was an U/17 World Cup winner with Switzerland.“The gaffer is very ambitious and very focused on details as well. I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee lift firm acquires competitor","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s Caltech Lifts has announced the acquisition of Coupar Angus-based competitor Scotlifts Scotland for an undisclosed sum.The cash deal means the Dundee firm will maintain more than 1,000 lifts across the UK.Caltech was founded in 1978 by engineer Howard Renwick and is now run by his sons Andrew and Fraser.Scotlifts Scotland owner Scott Murray will join the management team as Caltech’s new installations manager.Scotlifts’ 50 contract clients, employee and company assets will also transfer to the Dundee firm.Caltech managing director Andrew Renwick said: “Over 15 years Scott has built Scotlifts Scotland into a highly-regarded company.”Based at Stannergate Road, Caltech Limited’s clients include the public and private sectors and cover local government, health, construction, oil/energy, renewables and property.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people hundreds turn out for familyfun in the sun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBroughty Ferry Gala Week kicked off on Sunday as hundreds of people turned out for the fete, which took place at Castle Green.There was plenty to keep youngsters entertained, from face painting to traditional games.Also popular were the mods and rockers, who put on a bike display, and the craft fair.The beer tent and barbecue helped keep attendees fed and watered."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people job opportunities","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA local manufacturer has several positions available.Due to the steadily increasing demand for its products, the firm is looking to recruit city and guilds qualified bench joiners and wood machinists/CNC operators.Applicants who can demonstrate relevant experience of working in a joinery workshop environment may also be considered.The firm is also also seeking to appoint an experienced project coordinator to take responsibility for the preparation of the documentation necessary to enable manufacture to take place.

proposals that will provide access for disabled people to the whole of Coldside Community Library.The installation of a new lift at the rear, and some other internal revisions, will make the 110-year-old, A-listed building accessible to all.Judy Dobbie, head of library and information services at LACD, said: “We know how important libraries are to everyone in our communities and we are working with Dundee City Council to have an accessible toilet with baby changing facilities on the ground floor and lift access to the upper floor.“A new meeting room is to be built which will provide a private space for our health, social care and employability partners.“Coldside Library will be more accessible and enable us to deliver more events and services, ensuring that everyone in the community can access all our facilities including book lending, free internet, children’s activities and reading groups.”Alongside the new lift, a new disabled toilet will be installed on the ground floor, with another installed on the first floor alongside the library’s existing facilities.The library’s current reception desk will be replaced with a new, lower unit that is compliant with discrimination laws.While the work will have to be approved by planning officers at Dundee City Council before it can go ahead, it is thought the scheme will be met with little resistance.A note in the planning application said early feedback from the authority indicated that the proposals were “satisfactory”.The move has been welcomed by disability charity Pamis (Promoting A More Inclusive

dear","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSince relegation from the top flight in 2016, Dundee United have seen a massive 86 transfers in and out of Tannadice.The remarkable turnover of players just shows what the price of failure is – by the club as a whole and those players, some of whom have been and gone with very little success.And, with business still to be done over the next couple of months in re-shaping the current squad, that total is expected to rise even further before too long.Since the departure of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven at the end of January 2015 – the point where United’s downfall from cup finals and European football towards the second tier can be traced back to – the complete lack of continuity is an obvious factor in the club’s failure over recent seasons.Add in four managerial changes in that time and that’s a recipe for a whole lot of trouble.The number 86, obviously, includes a few players twice – i.e. they were transferred in and then transferred out – but since relegation the Tangerines have signed a huge 42 players in the past two years.Manager Csaba Laszlo has lifted the lid on how unorganised the club were last season and the number of ins and outs only strengthens that perception.This summer, Csaba, with help from chief scout Paul Sturrock, has brought in nine players already – with more expected.The big hope is this completely revamped team can finally get them back to the Premiership – something the 33 signings before them have distinctly failed to do.The pressure is on Nicky Clark, Callum Booth, Sam Wardrop, Fraser Aird, Craig Curran, Frederic Frans, Benjamin Siegrist, Matej Rakovan and Christoph Rabitsch to be the men that fire the Tangerines back up and have Arabs watching top-flight action come 2019/20.Last summer, 19 players were brought in by then manager Ray McKinnon and 13 the previous one immediately after suffering the drop.Of those 32, only 10 remain at the club and a few of those probably have a short future. They are Lewis Toshney, William Edjenguele, Stewart Murdoch, Fraser Fyvie, Deniz Mehmet, Billy King, Paul McMullan, Tam Scobbie, James Keatings and Sam Stanton. How many of them play a meaningful role in the push for promotion this coming season, however, is certainly up for debate.In the past two campaigns under McKinnon and Laszlo, United haven’t been a million miles away from getting themselves up through the play-offs.Add in a bit of continuity through their playing squad and around it surely can only help the club get back to where they feel they belong.A list of those 86 transfers, who have arrived, departed or done both: Harry Souttar, Darko Bodul, Eiji Kawashima, Chris Erskine, Michal Szromnik, Callum Morris, John Rankin, Paul Paton, Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Henri Anier, Edward Ofere, Guy Demel, Ryan Dow, Gavin Gunning, Toshney, Frank van der Struijk, Nick van der Velden, Willo Flood, Cammy Bell, Edjenguele, Murdoch, Tope Obadeyi,

clearing the site at the start of March and was due to be completed by the end of July.Councillors were told last month the cost was £172,293.However, Angus Council said “additional asbestos” has been

September.Andy Wilson, a member of the Damacre Centre residents’ committee, said: “This is the latest stage of what’s been a shoddy process all the way.“Damacre was built in the 1800s so there’s no surprise there’s a lot of asbestos in the building.”Fellow committee member Jill Scott also hit out saying: “This shows a complete lack of planning, all of which costs the taxpayer money.“I’m at a

looks to rocket dundee up the premiership table and says the skys the limit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew boy Elton Ngwatala insists the sky’s the limit for Dundee as they look to make an assault on the Premiership top-half next season.The French midfielder, signed from Kidderminster Harriers earlier in the summer, made his second appearance in dark blue in last night\u0026#8217s 1-0 win at Cowdenbeath.This followed his debut on Friday night in a 1-1 friendly draw with Brechin City at Glebe Park.Fellow summer arrival, Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy, got the visitors’ only goal just before the hour-mark as Kharl Madianga, Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph and trialist Brian Nana-Sinkam also got their first run-outs for Dundee.And 25-year-old Ngwatala believes there is no stopping him and his new team-mates from scaling the heights in the top flight next term – with a top-six finish a known aim of manager Neil McCann.“Friday night was my first game and it felt good to play with the new lads,” he said.“They are all new team-mates for me but, with 45 minutes in the tank, now I can improve.“Hopefully, within the next couple of weeks it will be perfect.“I think there is no limit next season. We have to take each game one by one and do the best we can to get the win.”Ngwatala admits the appeal to take his game to the next level was a huge factor in his move north of the border after playing in England’s sixth tier for the past three campaigns.As well as playing in front of terrific atmospheres at Dens Park, he is looking forward to testing himself on live television and under the spotlight of big crowds at Parkhead and Ibrox.He went on: “Dundee play in the Premiership so, for me, it was a big step up from playing in the Conference North in England.“It was important for me to move to Scotland and it feels like the right time to make this step.“I want to play at the highest level and going up against Celtic and Rangers is a big deal.“I have to test myself at the highest level.”Ngwatala also heaped praise on boss Neil and the rest of the staff at the club for welcoming him to the fold.The midfield man feels he has settled into the club with ease, though when asked if he has picked up on the local lingo yet, he said: “No, nothing yet!“The training has been nice to be fair, everybody has made me feel very welcome to the club, so it’s good,” he added.“The sessions have been good with the manager.”The Frenchman’s focus now is to show supporters more of what they can expect from him in the new campaign.He added: “I like to get on the ball, create things, make things happen.“Connecting and playing with my team-mates in short spaces is important but sometimes I do like a long shot!”Ngwatala’s new gaffer Neil was delighted his new boys got some valuable minutes under their belts despite drawing in Angus, saying: “I’m not really looking too much into the performances.“It was more just fitness and we had a number of new faces who joined us for the first time on Friday and it’s going to take a wee bit of time to get that understanding.“Overall, I was quite happy with the two 45 minutes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32068acec06-839x564.jpg ","title":"new boy mendy almost signed by dundee in january","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has revealed he was close to signing new Dundee arrival Jean Alassane Mendy back in January.He held talks with the Senegalese striker back then but was pipped for his signature by Belgians Lokeren.Things did not work out for Mendy there and now Neil is delighted to have been able to get a player he believes can score regularly in the top flight.He said: \u0026#8220We tried to get him in January and I think we missed out by just a couple of hours. He agreed to join Lokeren.\u0026#8220We kept an eye on him and we thought he’d do well here.  He’s got a good goal record previous to Lokeren – it didn’t quite happen for him there.\u0026#8220I believe he is a player who is a bit different to who we’ve got. He’s a good age, good experience and scored goals.“He’s the type of striker I’ve been looking for, he’s quick and gets down the sides of people,” he said.“He gets in between the sticks and that’s how he scores goals. One thing I like about him as well is that he’s got a very good work ethic because we are not the kind of team who can let people stand about.“There are a lot of strikers who bang in goals but I am not sure whether they have the work ethic to be my kind of player.“Jean ticked that box for me, he’s got good English and has played in a few countries so I think he will settle easily.”Meanwhile, young Dundee midfielder Jesse Curran has signed up for another year at Dens Park.The 21-year-old Australian has been in talks over a new deal for some time.He made eight top team appearances last term and manager Neil McCann was keen to hang on to him.Along with striker Matty Henvey, who penned a similar contract at the beginning of this week, the Dark Blues are looking for Curran to push for more game time in the coming campaign.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39ef1e06c5c-e1530537640590.jpg ","title":"new dundee putting green hopes to attract tiger woods and rory mcilroy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe world’s top golfing stars are being invited to Dundee’s Botanic Garden to work on their short game.Stars including Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy are set to descend on to Carnoustie this month ahead of the 147th Open.Staff at the University of Dundee’s Botanic Garden are already getting into the swing of things as they’ve opened their own putting green.The six-hole layout is now open to the public, with green fingered golf fans invited to test their skills on Dundee’s newest golf attraction.Entrants can tackle the course as part of the £3.90 entry fee with under-18s getting in free throughout the summer.Bob Sutherland, acting garden manager and designer of the course, said he believes players will find the family friendly layout above par.He said: “Everybody here is excited about The Open at Carnoustie and creating a miniature course is a great way to celebrate that while bringing something a bit different to the Botanic Garden.“Golf courses are often built among beautiful surroundings and ours is no exception.

changes to a funding formula which he claims leaves busy urban routes at a serious disadvantage.Milton Crescent in Hilton is to be completely resurfaced at a cost of \u0026pound100,000 and the work is due to start on Monday.Other roads across the city \u0026ndash including Midmills Road in the Crown area and Caledonian Road and Montague Row in Dalneigh are also set to have their potholes filled in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland.

faster.\u0026#8220I look forward to full power later in the summer.”Adam Ezzamel, Vattenfall’s EOWDC project director, said: “We have overcome major engineering and technical challenges to achieve

for offshore wind generation.”Jean Morrison, chair of Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG) added: “The timescale between the first installation and first power is remarkable.\u0026#8220The techniques and innovations developed at the EOWDC will be hugely significant for the industry and should help to reduce the future costs of offshore wind.\u0026#8220As energy demand grows, we need to

from the world’s most powerful offshore wind turbines which, with each rotation at full power, will generate enough energy to power a home for 24 hours.“Once the test and demonstration site is fully operational, not only will this help the offshore wind sector to further reduce its costs through lessons learned during operations, but the output from EOWDC will itself add significantly to Scotland’s renewable electricity generating capacity, building on figures announced last month that showed installed capacity reached a record 10.4GW in the first three months of 2018 and which also

I put in a great run and to actually win the race makes me very, very happy.”Asked about the pressure of going off last, he added: “I didn’t know how the race was going and I don’t really find it makes a lot of odds.”Scotland’s Fiona Pennie was Great Britain’s sole representative in the women’s single kayak (K1) final. Contesting her first World Cup final of the season, she picked up a touch early on at gate two and could not find the added pace to keep the later paddlers at bay.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bins-set-alight-outside-hawick-shop","story":"WITNESSES are being sought after two bins were set alight near a shop in Hawick.\nThe fire happened at around 3.25am on Friday, June 22 on the town\u0027s High Street.\nTwo large metal wheelie bins were set alight at the rear of The Card Factory store, however quick action of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service mean the fire was extinguished before the flames could spread.\nAs a result, the outer wall and a window sustained damage, while one of the building vents was also destroyed.\nNo one was injured and inquiries are ongoing to identify whoever was responsible.\nInspector Kevin Harris from Hawick Police Station said: \"Had this fire spread then a number of homes and businesses could have been affected.\n\"We are keen to hear from anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious within the High Street during the early hours of Thursday morning, or who can help us trace the culprits.\n\"Anyone with information should contact police immediately.\"\nThose with information can contact Hawick Police Station via 101 and quote incident number 426 of June 22.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716329068,16329035,16329016,16328910,16327639\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

control strikes left more than 210,000 passengers facing flight cancellations in June.\nThe Dublin-based carrier said more than 1,100 flights were cancelled for the second month running due to air traffic control strikes over four weekends in June, as well as staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France.\nThis compared\u0026nbspwith just 41 cancellations in June last year.\nThe low-cost group repeated its call for action from Europe to help tackle disruption from the strikes.\nChief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: \u0026ldquoRegrettably, over 210,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in June because of four weekends of ATC (air traffic control) strikes and repeated UK, German and French ATC staff shortages.\n\u0026ldquoRyanair calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and European governments to ameliorate the effect of ATC strikes and staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France from disrupting the travel plans of millions of Europe\u0026rsquos consumers this summer.\nFellow airline easyJet has also revealed the impact of the strike woes in recent weeks, cancelling nearly\u0026nbsp1,000 flights in May, as widespread thunderstorms also took their toll.\nAir traffic control strikes are costly for airlines and hugely disruptive for passengers, especially in France, as many UK flights need to use the country\u0026rsquos air space or fly longer routes to avoid it.\nBut ATC action has become a regular headache for the industry in recent years, with 2017 said to be a record for strikes, with 41 days affected.\nDespite the strike action, Ryanair said it still flew 7% more passengers last month, at 12.6 million.\nIts load factor \u0026ndash a measure of how well airlines fill their planes \u0026ndash remained unchanged at 96%.\nRyanair and British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) have recently joined forces to prepare a legal complaint\u0026nbspto the European Commission over the crippling ATC strikes.\nThey will argue that EU law is being infringed by not adequately protecting flights over France as they claim the commission\u0026rsquos failure to tackle the issue is breaching freedom of movement for Europeans.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"  The phonebox, outside the police station on Court Street, was removed by BT last Tuesday.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice.

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.

Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

This compared\u0026nbspwith just 41 cancellations in June last year.  The low-cost group repeated its call for action from Europe to help tackle disruption from the strikes.  Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: \u0026ldquoRegrettably, over 210,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in June because of four weekends of ATC (air traffic control) strikes and repeated UK, German and French ATC staff shortages.  \u0026ldquoRyanair calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and European governments to ameliorate the effect of ATC strikes and staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France from disrupting the travel plans of millions of Europe\u0026rsquos consumers this summer.  Fellow airline easyJet has also revealed the impact of the strike woes in recent weeks, cancelling nearly\u0026nbsp1,000 flights in May, as widespread thunderstorms also took their toll.  Air traffic control strikes are costly for airlines and hugely disruptive for passengers, especially in France, as many UK flights need to use the country\u0026rsquos air space or fly longer routes to avoid it.  But ATC action has become a regular headache for the industry in recent years, with 2017 said to be a record for strikes, with 41 days affected.  Despite the strike action, Ryanair said it still flew 7% more passengers last month, at 12.6 million.  Its load factor \u0026ndash a measure of how well airlines fill their planes \u0026ndash remained unchanged at 96%.  Ryanair and British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) have recently joined forces to prepare a legal complaint\u0026nbspto the European Commission over the crippling ATC strikes.  They will argue that EU law is being infringed by not adequately protecting flights over France as they claim the commission\u0026rsquos failure to tackle the issue is breaching freedom of movement for Europeans."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8013384.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"young-adults-shunning-smoking-figures-suggest","story":"  New Office for National Statistics data shows that the largest reduction in smoking prevalence since 2011 has been noted among 18 to 24-year-olds.

It said in a brief statement that Mr Najib will be brought to court on Wednesday to be charged, but did not give details of the charges against him.    Mr Najib\u0026rsquos arrest comes nearly two months after his coalition\u0026rsquos stunning rejection by voters in a May 9 general election.  The new government has reopened investigations into 1MDB that were stifled under Mr Najib\u0026rsquos rule.  Mr Najib and his wife, who have been questioned over the SRC issue by the anti-corruption agency, have been barred from leaving the country.  Police have also seized jewellery and valuables valued at more than 1.1 billion ringgit (\u0026pound206 million) from properties linked to Mr Najib, who has denied any wrongdoing.  The anti-corruption agency earlier Tuesday questioned Riza Aziz, Mr Najib\u0026rsquos stepson and a Hollywood film producer, as it stepped up its probe on 1MDB.  Mr Riza was solemn as he arrived at the anti-corruption office and did not speak to reporters.  US investigators say Mr Riza\u0026rsquos company, Red Granite Pictures Inc, used money stolen from 1MDB to finance Hollywood films including the Martin Scorsese-directed The Wolf Of Wall Street.  Red Granite in March agreed to pay the US government \u0026pound45.4 million to settle claims that it benefited from the 1MDB scandal.  The civil suit against Red Granite was part of an effort to recover some of the \u0026pound3.4 billion that US prosecutors say was stolen from 1MDB.  They say hundreds of millions from 1MDB landed in Mr Najib\u0026rsquos bank accounts.  The 1MDB government task force this week said 408 bank accounts involving funds of nearly 1.1 billion ringgit (\u0026pound206 million) had been frozen.

Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

It comes as Gordon Brown warned the NHS would be \u0026ldquoin trauma within a decade if Scotland became independent.  The former prime minister said the NHS would be a \u0026ldquodiminished service after separation, and repeated his claims that the SNP\u0026rsquos latest independence blueprint would lead to austerity.  Statistics reveal GPs charged as much as \u0026pound1,400 per day for cover in Orkney in 2016/17, the latest year for which figures are available, while in NHS Lanarkshire charges were as high as \u0026pound1,132 per day.  Average daily rates for locum GPs varied across Scotland, from just \u0026pound90 in Dumfries and Galloway to \u0026pound851.52 in Lanarkshire. Five health boards \u0026ndash including Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Lothians \u0026ndash failed to provide information.  Earlier this year, it emerged NHS spending on agency workers had reached more than \u0026pound300 million for the first time ever.  Scottish Labour, which obtained the latest figures through Freedom of Information laws, insisted it was \u0026ldquoutterly shocking that the SNP GP crisis has created a situation where locum costs are over a thousand pounds a day.  Shadow health secretary Anas Sarwar said: \u0026ldquoThe reality is the SNP has underfunded primary care for over a decade and as a result family doctors are left over stretched, overworked and under too much pressure.  But a spokesman for new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman accused Labour of talking down the NHS instead of celebrating its achievements as it turns 70.  He said: \u0026ldquoInvestment in our health service is currently at a record high, and we aim to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over ten years to ensure a sustainable service that meets increasing demand.  Writing in The Scotsman, Mr Brown argued Scotland\u0026rsquos health service is currently \"under-staffed, under-equipped and under-financed\", despite Theresa May recently announcing a \u0026pound20 billion funding boost, translating to an extra \u0026pound2bn north of the Border.  He wrote: \"The NHS at 80 years old would, sadly, be in trauma if independence should ever happen.  \"What has become clear from the SNP\u0027s Growth Commission blueprint \u0026ndash what Nicola Sturgeon calls the foundation for independence \u0026ndash is that public spending would rise less than under Tory austerity and that even then, any new money there is would be eaten up by massive interest rate payments on what would be almost \u0026pound100 billion of new Scottish debt.\"  Mr Brown previously warned austerity will be \u0026ldquohere until doomsday under the SNP and its proposals for independence."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8011733.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-school-of-art-cranes-move-in-and-workers-ready-to-remove-the-mack-piece-by-piece","story":"  But preparations have been finalised to start dismantling the world-renowned Charles Rennie Mackintosh designed Glasgow School of Art (GSA).  Structural engineers David Narro Associates and the contractor, Reigart, have prepared plans for the work that will need to be undertaken on the Mackintosh Building.  Plans have been shared with Glasgow City Council Building Control and Historic Environment Scotland.  Bosses for the GSA said work had been carried out over the weekend to assess the condition of the Mackintosh building, with further drone footage collected.    Final preparation work for the dismantling of the elements of the building that have been deemed dangerous begin today. The main crane has been relocated to the corner of Sauchiehall Street and Dalhousie Street, and a second crane is expected to join it tomorrow.  The work to begin dismantling the south fa\u0026ccedilade will start as soon as possible following approval of the methodology by Glasgow City Council Building Control. Work is needed following a devastating fire that ripped through the building \u0026ndash known as the Mack \u0026ndash on June 15.  For more than a century this majestic building which sits on a hill above Sauchiehall Street has been the beating heart of Glasgow\u0026rsquos cultural life.  It survived two world wars and one almost catastrophic fire four years ago.  Now, large sections of the Mackintosh building will be \u0026ldquodismantled starting today following a second inferno two weeks ago, with fears it will never be rebuilt with the bill estimated to be as high as \u0026pound200 million.  No-one could have predicted the turn of events which led to the almost-renovated building being destroyed in a fire, with new pictures yesterday revealing the full extent of the damage.  It was late on a Friday night when the fire was spotted by a passing policeman. Within an hour, it had spread like wildfire with the flames carrying over to the adjacent O2 ABC where the roof soon caved in Today, there is both physical and mental turmoil.  People have been unable to return to their homes in the area around Garnethill and Sauchiehall Street since the devastating blaze. Businesses have been locked out, with owners and staff facing penury.  But council bosses have condemned people who breach the GSA cordon as \u0026ldquodeeply stupid.    The words come as locals claim to still be seeing people climbing the fence \u0026ndash despite warnings the Mackintosh building is at risk of imminent collapse. A member of Gartnethill Community Council told how one man brazenly walked up to the fence mid-afternoon and tried to pull it down.  Other locals said they saw men climb the fence in the early hours of both Saturday and Sunday.  Ian Khan, of the community council, said he had to chase away a man who tried to enter the cordon on Sunday at around 4pm. He said: \u0026ldquoWe had a meeting on Sunday afternoon and then walked around to the front of the Mackintosh building to take a look. There was a man walking up Renfrew Street with headphones in. He walked right up and started trying to pull away the fence.  \u0026ldquoI said to him, \u0026lsquoWhat are you doing?\u0026rsquo and he said, \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom just going in.\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquoWe told him he couldn\u0026rsquot do that but he ignored us and went in anyway.  \u0026ldquoThe cordon around the art school is not good enough.  The blaze ravaged the Mackintosh building on June 15, as well as spreading to the O2 ABC venue and Campus nightclub.  There have previously been arrests after individuals tried to breach the safety cordon put up in the wake of the fire.  Art school bosses have said the site is extremely dangerous with brick work at risk of collapse.  A council spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe exclusion zone exists for one reason \u0026ndash to protect life and limb. Anyone entering the area, other than a trained and accredited expert, is not only putting their life at risk but also deeply stupid.  Meanwhile, council leader Susan Aitken has said it is likely to be weeks, rather than months, before residents evacuated from their homes by the fire can return.  She said council bosses are in contact with the Association of British Insurers to smooth out issues for the now homeless residents.  This week there will be a clinic hosted by legal firm Harper Macleod to provide information to businesses on certain insurance and legal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"we-invested-our-life-savings-in-top-end-housing-scheme-and-lost-everything","story":"  The two 70-somethings are visiting the new-build housing scheme in Cleland, North Lanarkshire, for the first time, chatting in the sunshine as they wander past five-bedroom detached homes behind freshly laid lawns and drives full of spotless BMWs.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom really impressed, Ms Tatters tells Ms Wilkinson. \u0026ldquoThis is really top-end. Ms Wilkinson agrees: \u0026ldquoIt is just as I imagined it would be.  Ms Tatters, 71, is a businesswoman from Elgin. Ms Wilkinson, 74, is an actor from Sussex. The pair are among more than two dozen small investors who put up some \u0026pound1.2 million to get the Bellside Brae scheme off the ground. Their money has gone. They want to know where. So do politicians.  Ms Tatters and Ms Wilkinson and their fellow Bellside Brae investors were among hundreds of people to put money through a UK business called Cavendish Moore.  Now closed, this firm hit the headlines back in 2011 after Britain\u0026rsquos financial services watchdog launched a probe into its conduct. Cavendish Moore had placed adverts in the press offering returns of \u0026ldquoup to 50 per cent in two years in land and property investments. \u0026ldquoCan you afford to miss out? its publicity asked.  Cavendish Moore insisted it was different to so-called land bank scams \u0026ndash schemes where investors, often elderly, are enticed to invest in plots which had still to get planning permission. Instead the firm said it specialised in finding investors for land that was ready to be developed. And it grouped together investors into limited liability partnerships or LLPs to carry out individual projects.  The old Financial Services Authority (FSA) thought this amounted to an unlawful collective investment scheme. Its successor body, the Financial Conduct Authority by 2014 did a deal under which Cavendish Moore had to pay some of its investors back just 10 per cent of their money. Some of those who did get cash were already dead.  The firm is now being wound up. Its liquidator, Paul Allen of FRP Advisory, late last month said he had discovered a number of large transactions carried out by Cavendish Moore before it was shut down. In a formal report filed at Companies House, he said: \u0026ldquoI have thus far been unable to establish the ultimate beneficiaries and/or the rationale for a number of such transactions..  The investors in Bellside Brae were just one group of many who formed an LLP called Cicada under the guidance of Cavendish Moore.  After payments to Cavendish Moore, this firm representing 27 investors in 2009 put \u0026pound700,000 into a joint venture with a developer called Clydebrae Developments to put up the homes now called Bellside Brae.  Matt Blair, a retired Scottish engineer who now lives in England, was as impressed as Ms Tatters and Ms Wilkinson with the new homes.  He said:It is slightly better than I expected. The finish is fabulous. They have done a great job. But we have been excluded from benefiting from this project. I think it is inconceivable that you can build quality homes on a site like this and that your money could disappear.  \u0026ldquoWhen you make an investment you know there is risk. You might not get all of your money back, but to lose all of it?  The problem for Mr Blair and his fellow investors is that Clydebrae Developments went under before the project was finished. The business was struck off in 2015. It had no assets. Clydebrae was owned by another 70-something man, Robert Kirk of Helensburgh. The land it was developing, it turned out, did not belong to Clydebrae, it was held by a business registered in the British Virgin Islands called Crannoch Investments, in trust, according to lawyers for Cicada, for Mr Kirk.  The Herald asked Mr Kirk if he could explain what had happened to the investors\u0026rsquo money. Speaking at his sandstone home in the leafy west end of Helensburgh, Mr Kirk said he could not say. He added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom retired and I have been out of it for seven years. I don\u0026rsquot know what the situation is now. \u0026ldquo  Mr Kirk had more to say in a letter last year to a lawyer hired by the investors, most of whom lost \u0026pound35,000 in the scheme. He said he did not have any interest in the offshore firm Crannoch and that Clydebrae had made no profits and owed the investors nothing.  He said money from the joint venture had gone to complete groundwork at the site.  Bellside Brae, he added, was \u0026ldquounsuccessful for a number of reasons, predominately market related. Clydebrae was forced to sell its right to develop the land by its secured creditors, he explained.  Rights were bought by another business called Calder Developments. One of its former directors, Mark Thompson, had also served as a director of Clydebrae. The Herald was unable to reach either Calder or Mr Thompson for comment.  Mr Kirk wrote: \u0026ldquoI did not benefit financially from [this] transaction. I have lost a significant sum of money. I do not own my home as a result and am living in rented accommodation.  Ms Wilkinson, who featured in the 1960s soap Compact, is also now renting, a single room. \u0026ldquoI thought I was going to get a little flat. That has all been taken away from me. Now I live on benefits.  Aberdeen North MP Kirsty Blackman said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom concerned that those who invested in Bellside seem to have lost significant amounts of money, and there is almost no ability to seek redress, or even to get information about where their investment has gone."},{"url":null,"title":"annie-lennox-named-first-female-chancellor-of-glasgow-caledonian-university","story":"  The\u0026nbspsinger-songwriter and social activist said she was \u0026ldquohumbled and awed beyond measure to be appointed to the position at the university.

Genetically engineered mice given the drug had reduced levels of a key hallmark of Alzheimer\u0026rsquos in their brains, sticky clumps of beta amyloid peptide.  Impaired clearance of the protein building block from the brain is thought to be one of the main causes of the disease.  A US team led by Professor Kalipada Pahan, from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, found low-dose aspirin stimulated the formation of lysosomes \u0026ndash\u0026nbsptiny sacs in cells filled with digestive enzymes that help break down and clear away unwanted or harmful material.  The scientists wrote in the journal JNeurosci: \u0026ldquoStimulation of lysosomal biogenesis and reduction of amyloid plaque\u0026nbsppathology by low-dose aspirin holds promising therapeutic potential for treatment of AD (Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease).  However British experts urged caution.\u0026nbsp  Professor Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoWhile this work is scientifically interesting, it is at very early stages.  \u0026ldquoThe amyloid reducing effects of aspirin were shown in cells in a dish and in a single mouse model of Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease with relatively few mice per group.  \u0026ldquoFurther, the study did not show whether aspirin helped the brain function in this disease model.\u0026nbspMore work will need to be done in order to know whether low-dose aspirin could help prevent or treat Alzheimer\u0026rsquos.  Rob Howard, Professor of Old Age Psychiatry at University College London, added: \u0026ldquoClinical trials of aspirin have already been performed in patients with Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease.  \u0026ldquoThe drug had no beneficial effects on outcome measures and was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.  The American researchers pointed out\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspmechanism appeared to be dependent on a protein called PPAR-alpha, levels of which fell significantly with age.  This might explain why trials looking at the effects of aspirin on elderly Alzheimer\u0026rsquos patients had produced disappointing results, they said.  Dr Sara Imarisio, from Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, said: \u0026ldquoAspirin is a commonly taken medicine for a number of health conditions, but there has been little research to examine potential benefits for Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease.  \u0026ldquoThis early-stage research suggests aspirin may help improve how the brain removes amyloid, a protein known to build up in Alzheimer\u0026rsquos.

The sweltering spell has continued into July, with many parts enjoying temperatures around the mid-to-high 20s.  Tennis lovers looked set for plenty of action as Wimbledon began on Monday, with stars kicking the tournament off on sun-drenched courts.  Meanwhile, utility companies have been pumping billions of extra litres of water to try and keep pace with demand, which has risen by as much as 30%, Water UK said.  But there is no risk of drought, as above-average rainfall in the Spring means water levels are in a healthy position, it added.  There are currently no restrictions in England, but Thames Water says it is funnelling an extra 450 million litres per day as it deals with \u0026ldquorecord levels of demand and many suppliers are warning their customers to use water sparingly.  Some households in Berkshire, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire may see low-pressure hit their water supplies during peak hours, it added.  In the Republic of Ireland, a month-long hosepipe ban took effect in the greater Dublin area on Monday as demand continues to outstrip supply across the country.  The weather has been dry since late February in the country, with authorities saying rainfall has been similar to 1976, when a major drought took hold, Irish Water said.  It follows the ban introduced across Northern Ireland last Friday with the public asked to limit tap water use to drinking, cooking and washing.

Izzi Seccombe, Chairman of the LGA\u0026rsquos Community Wellbeing Board, said: \u0026ldquoThe hundreds of deaths caused by high temperatures each year are avoidable.  \u0026ldquoCouncils are determined to reduce the toll as much as possible, but they cannot do it alone.  \u0026ldquoLocal people can make a massive difference by helping us identify other residents who might need some advice or practical help."},{"url":null,"title":"number-of-children-calling-helpline-over-loneliness-up-by-more-than-a-third","story":"  Childline delivered counselling sessions to 272 children in Scotland who felt lonely in 2017/18, up from 199 the previous year.  The charity said that mental health issues, bullying and social media are all contributing towards a growing number of young people struggling with feelings of isolation and loneliness.  Across the UK, the NSPCC-supported service delivered 4,636 counselling sessions to children for loneliness in 2017/18 - a 14% rise on the previous year.  Teenagers accounted for most of the sessions, with the youngest person being just 10.  The NSPCC\u0027s Are you there? campaign is calling on the UK Government to provide funding to Childline so it can help more children and teenagers struggling with mental health issues.  Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen said: \"Loneliness needs to be taken seriously because it is potentially damaging to children\u0027s physical and mental health.  \"The crucial question is what is causing this rise among the young?  \"Are we all too busy to make space and time for our children? Is it that we have lost the habit of eating together?  \"Or is it the illusion created by social networks that everyone else is liked, popular and enjoying a far more exciting life, so they feel lonelier than ever?  \"Whatever the reason, it\u0027s crucial that young people know they can always contact Childline to speak to someone who will listen and care about them.\"  Two of Childline\u0027s 12 UK bases are in Scotland and both of them carried out more counselling sessions with young people experiencing loneliness in the last year.  Glasgow\u0027s Childline base answered 817 calls from children across the UK who were feeling lonely, up from 693 the previous year, while the Aberdeen base carried out 202 counselling sessions with UK children, up from 164.  Almost eight in ten of the calls were from girls, some of whom highlighted the harmful effects of social media use.

This compared\u0026nbspwith just 41 cancellations in June last year.  The low-cost group repeated its call for action from Europe to help tackle disruption from the strikes.  Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: \u0026ldquoRegrettably, over 210,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in June because of four weekends of ATC (air traffic control) strikes and repeated UK, German and French ATC staff shortages.  \u0026ldquoRyanair calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and European governments to ameliorate the effect of ATC strikes and staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France from disrupting the travel plans of millions of Europe\u0026rsquos consumers this summer.  Fellow airline easyJet has also revealed the impact of the strike woes in recent weeks, cancelling nearly\u0026nbsp1,000 flights in May, as widespread thunderstorms also took their toll.  Air traffic control strikes are costly for airlines and hugely disruptive for passengers, especially in France, as many UK flights need to use the country\u0026rsquos air space or fly longer routes to avoid it.  But ATC action has become a regular headache for the industry in recent years, with 2017 said to be a record for strikes, with 41 days affected.  Despite the strike action, Ryanair said it still flew 7% more passengers last month, at 12.6 million.

The whole Cabinet will be at the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos official country retreat in Buckinghamshire on Friday. The venue offers more privacy than Downing Street, where reporters and photographers can linger outside the black door to No 10. Ministers will be kept at the mansion until they have reached agreement.  \u0026ndash What do they need to decide?  The Government has to set out what it wants its future relationship with the European Union after Brexit to look like. This includes issues relating to customs and trade which have triggered furious rows within the Tory ranks.  \u0026ndash What about customs?  On customs, two models have been considered by ministers: the \u0026ldquomaximum facilitation system favoured by Brexiteers, which would use technology to help reduce friction at the border or the \u0026ldquocustoms partnership where the UK would collect duties on behalf of the EU.  Because of problems with both models, a \u0026ldquothird way may now be under consideration, although details are scant on what the compromise could be.  \u0026ndash What about the single market?  The Prime Minister has ruled out remaining in the single market, but fundamental questions need to be resolved about how far the UK will deviate from the standards set by Brussels.  Businesses fear that if domestic rules after Brexit stray too far from those set by the EU, it will hamper their ability to work and trade in those markets.  But some Brexiteers favour divergence, arguing that it will enable the UK to compete on the global stage and slash red tape. They question what the point of leaving the EU will be if the UK remains bound by rules over which it no longer has a say.  \u0026ndash Will decisions be reached?  Mrs May has so far managed to hold together the mix of Brexiteers and former Remainers in her Cabinet, but descending from the fence on one side or the other of the debate is likely to strain that fragile truce.  A further slice of Brexit fudge is a possibility, but the Prime Minister has promised the White Paper that will emerge after the talks \u0026ldquowill set out detailed proposals.  \u0026ndash Could there be resignations?  Tensions are undoubtedly running high. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson could face a difficult decision if the Cabinet comes down in favour of close alignment with EU rules and the \u0026ldquocustoms partnership model.  On the other hand, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark would resist any Brexit deal which would hit jobs and the economy.  \u0026ndash What next?  A White Paper setting out the Government\u0026rsquos blueprint for Brexit will be published next week. Mrs May wants talks with Brussels to \u0026ldquointensify and accelerate once it is produced.  EU leaders, who have been frustrated that it has taken the UK Government so long to set out its plan, called for \u0026ldquorealistic and workable proposals.

Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing.

Scottish Conservative Mr Clark said: “The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen is a major promoter of STEM subjects.“Does the Minister agree that it is essential to prioritise the take-up of STEM subjects if we are to have the engineers and technicians that we need for the future?”Sam Gyimah MP said the English school system had welcomed 17% more entrants to STEM A-levels since 2010, adding:“However, there is clearly a lot more to do, which is why we are focused on doing a lot through careers and through the university system.”                                                                                                        The UK Government is investing an additional £406 million in skills, including maths and digital, including an advanced maths premium, and an £84 million programme to improve the teaching of computing.After the session, Mr Clark said Scotland is behind England in science, maths and reading.He added: “There is also a shortage of STEM teachers in Scotland and it risks undermining children’s opportunities, including at Inverurie Academy in my constituency.“We have to catch up with England and re-establish the world-class education system we once had.                                                                                                        “That’s why it’s disappointing the SNP have deprioritised its education Bill.\"                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"encouraging prospects for beef and sheep markets","story":"\t\tThe transformation in the weather since mid-May and the consequent quick growth of grass has given Aberdeen and Northern Marts\u0026#8217 sales of breeding stock a massive boost in recent weeks.\t\t\t\tThe average price of heifers with calves at foot at the latest sale at Thainstone Centre was £150 up on the first seasonal sale at the beginning of May and £350 higher than last year, ANM head of livestock, John Angus reports.                                                    “It is encouraging that we have had more buyers round the ring at the May breeding stock sales and good quality heifers with calves at foot have been making £2,400 to £3,000 a unit,” said Mr Angus.                                                    “We had very little grass growth at the time of the first sale but the situation had completely changed by the time of the next sale three weeks later.”        Mr Angus said the strong trade indicated that confidence was returning to the beef industry and it was good to see herds replacing breeding stock on the back of buoyant prices for store cattle and a measure of stability in the prime cattle market.Highlights included a record price of 13,000gns for a Simmental bull at the spring bull sale at Thainstone and a heifer and calves selling for up to £5,200.“The prospects for the beef market for the second half of the year are looking good, but there are real concerns about the rising cost of fodder and straw due to the diversion of distillery co-products into the energy market and the switch to ryegrass on some farms to feed anaerobic digesters,” he said. “We could do with some rain to make sure silage crops bulk up although some farmers have been cutting grass early for silage out of fear of grass burning up.”Although some older farmers were tending to cut back breeding cow numbers to make life easier for themselves, there were fewer suckler herd dispersals this spring and very few cows and calves have been coming on the market.                                                                                                        Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal. One is 4.6 kilometres long and the other 2.7 kilometres.They will be used by Shell to develop the potential reserves in the Penguins field.Subsea7\u0026rsquos local site manager, Willie Watt, said: \u0026ldquoWe would be looking to make a start on this project by the autumn of next year and launch in the late spring of 2020.\u0026ldquoThis is very good news for the site and for Caithness. It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation. When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not! I\u0026rsquove lived a normal sort of life and I\u0026rsquove been lucky, particularly with my health.\"In recent years she has taken up using an iPad, can send emails and enjoys playing Candy Crush.Exhibition and sale days at The Muir Hub, which is on Great North Road, will be staged until\u0026nbspThursday between 9.30am and 4pm.Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The new investment is a vote of confidence in a thriving local community and will create and sustain local jobs for some years forward.\"The new homes will range from two-bedroom semi-detached through to four-bedroom detached homes.Tulloch will also stage an open day next Saturday for its Chanonry Park scheme in Fortrose where homes have a price tag of between \u0026pound225,000 for a three-bedroom detached villa and \u0026pound268,000 for a four-bedroom detached home with garage.She described Chanonry Park as \"an excellent development for us\" and expects the Fortrose scheme to sell out this summer.She said: \"This will bring to an end eight years of Tulloch Homes involvement with Fortrose, during which it has assisted in local population growth.\"The developer said it was looking for prospective development sites on the Black Isle as the area has witnessed a steady demand for housing in recent years.Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A number of new schools have been built, which is brilliant for the pupils and communities that benefit.\"Despite receiving more funding than nearly all other local authorities, Highland Council still has the worst school estate in Scotland.\"The funding recognises the rurality of Highland Council, but most schools have been built in more densely populated areas like Inverness. It is of particular sadness that this funding has not gone further so that more school buildings could benefit.\"But Highland Council leader Margaret Davidson has defended the local authority\u0026rsquos track record, pointing out that it has 204 schools to maintain \u0026ndash more than any other area in the country. She added that Scottish Schools for the Future funding was welcome but added that current levels of funding from Holyrood are \"simply not enough to adequately invest in our schools\".She urged the Scottish Government to provide funding levels which recognise the unique challenges facing the Highlands, \"and in particular the very large number of schools, many of which are smaller schools, requiring urgent investment\".And she called for it to consider capacity pressures when allocating funding.\"If Kate Forbes wants to help Highland schools, then she should support our asks from government.\"Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762978.1530605465!/image/image.jpg","title":"darren mcgarvey i m struggling to cope with success","story":"\t\tAbscesses, insomnia and migraines - Orwell Prize winner Darren McGarvey writes candidly about his mental and emotional struggle with success.\t\t\t\tIt’s 1.38 on Monday morning and, in an abandoned hotel foyer at the Holiday Inn Express in Stratford, I am about to start writing my column. I’m so tired I could cry. \u2028In the morning, we’re taking my son to Thomas The Tank Engine Land and we decided to drive down on Sunday evening to avoid the traffic.             I don’t want to have to work on what should be the first day of a family holiday, which means pulling an all-nighter, so I can file without missing quality time with my children.            This time last week, I was in another hotel in London. The week before that, Edinburgh. Or was it Salford? Or Dundee? It’s hard to say, if I’m honest. The workload has fried my brain to the point I often cannot recall the prior day’s events when asked what I’ve been up to. I feel like I am losing my mind. Every day bleeds into the next, with no respite in sight. But complaining about the fact I feel like I am on the cliff-edge of a mental health crisis seems utterly futile because, from the outside, it appears I am enjoying wonderful, unprecedented success. Success for which I ought to be grateful.Of course, I am grateful. If anything, I am in a state of permanent disbelief about what is going on. The truth is I haven’t had a minute to reflect on or even savour anything that has happened since November last year when the publication of my book began a chain of events that culminated, last Monday, in being awarded the coveted Orwell Prize.More people than ever seem to want to speak to me, for different reasons. Some just want to say, “well done” and others want to share their stories. Some want to me to come and visit their projects and others want to buy the film and TV rights to my life story.             I did some business in London last week that will make your eyes bulge out of their sockets when its announced, yet somehow, in this haze of physical and emotional exasperation, nothing feels real. I don’t even feel real.READ MORE: Scotsman columnist Darren McGarvey wins Orwell Prize for political writingPeople love a good rags-to-riches story. Hell, I know I do. But imagine how surreal it feels when you become the centre of one. You are suddenly inundated with requests, calls, offers and correspondence, without any frame of reference for what is going on. It’s incredibly disorientating and sometimes frightening, if I’m honest. But there is rarely an opportunity to express that truth, because you are always being prompted to describe how it feels to become “successful”. People want to hear a specific story. The story about a diamond in the rough, escaping poverty, surviving neglect and abuse to become an award-winning author. People are less interested in what it took to get into this position.             The fact I am struggling mentally and emotionally is even less interesting. The details about my cluster migraines, abscesses and insomnia are met with looks of confusion, as people instinctively attempt to direct me away from what I want to say and back to the “narrative”: my capitalist hero-journey. They don’t want to hear about the thousands I’ve spent on hotels, trains and flights, travelling this island by myself, with a heavy bag over my shoulder and a box of books under my arm, literally selling hand-to-hand. The hundreds of books I’ve purchased with my own money, to sign and post all over the world to plug gaping holes in my finances. They don’t want to hear about the anxiety attacks I often experience as notifications flood my devices or the fear I suffer every time I give an interview to a newspaper or broadcaster. Nobody cares that I live in constant dread that I will misspeak on a sensitive issue and become a target for people online. Nobody is interested in me describing what it feels like to come home after weeks of being on the road, to find my two-year old sitting with his back to me – his way of letting me know he isn’t pleased with my absence. I haven’t made a penny off my book yet. I am living off advances. But any time I try to express that these overwhelming mundanities – and not the successes – are what currently consume every moment of my waking life, I feel the weight of other people’s expectations bearing down on me. READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Journalists must leave their ivory towers to gain respect            To the extent that I am learning it’s best to simply conceal the reality of my life, or risk appearing ungrateful or worse, spoiling the vicarious thrill others might experience when they enquire, “how does it feel?”I don’t know how it feels. I haven’t had a minute to take anything in. I run around like a mad-man, I fall asleep somewhere, and I wake up and do it all again. Every. Single. Day. No matter who I speak to, my constant refrain – that I am in urgent need of rest and fear I may be heading for a fall – never seems to be heard. The only thing I haven’t been offered in the last seven days is a good night’s sleep. I feel obligated to so many people, for different reasons, that my own needs fall to the bottom of the hierarchy of concern. My problems are marked as low-priority and so must remain hidden, revealed only in late-night social media outbursts when I feel trapped on Scotland’s decrepit public transportation network.All I need is a few days where I am not expected to do anything. Where I am not obligated to speak to anybody. Where I can gather my thoughts and rejuvenate after two years of non-stop, high-pressure work, couched in constant financial insecurity and stress. Anybody getting any ideas that I’m too far removed from the working class to write about it, ought to refer to my seven-day-a-week schedule for proof that I am more working class now than I ever was – with no holiday entitlement. It’s 3.10am. The kids will be up in four hours.

Two options for customs arrangements after Brexit were drawn up in full knowledge that both would be unacceptable to factions within the Conservative party and also, more importantly, the European Union.            These have now reportedly been ditched with the belated realisation that they were either practically or politically impossible to deliver.

Her watchwords during this process appear to have been delay, dither and dissemble, but unfortunately, time is now running out.As the head of the 60-strong European Research Group of hard-Brexiteer MPs, Jacob Rees-Mogg is effectively the leader of a party within a party. He has warned they will not sign up to anything short of a clean break, prompting fellow Sir Alan Duncan, a fellow Tory MP and Government minister, to criticise Rees-Mogg’s “insolence”. “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down,” he tweeted.

If the UK cannot decide what it wants, it will end up getting exactly what they want. Politicians of all parties need to realise the old fault lines do not apply on this issue and that, for the sake of the nation, they must form an ad hoc ‘national coalition of the sensible’ to secure a Brexit deal that will outrage the hardliners but save the economy from disaster.READ MORE: Lesley Riddoch: Doomsday report exposes Brexit vulnerability"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762976.1530605815!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis media is doing its job over brexit dark money","story":"\t\tDUP Brexit spending raises concerns about the law, not about how it was reported, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.\t\t\t\tIn the final days of the EU referendum campaign, the Democratic Unionist Party paid for a wrap-around advert in the , calling on voters to “take back control”.            The message reached far beyond Northern Ireland, where the  isn’t even distributed, and should have been far beyond their means – an advert like that costs more than a quarter of a million pounds. The DUP spent less than £100,000 on an entire devolved election campaign in 2016.            In fact, the party that now keeps the Conservatives in power spent an incredible £425,000 on Brexit, buying a lot besides newspaper advertising. How they came into that money might have remained a secret, but for intense political and media pressure.Electoral rules in Northern Ireland did not, until recently, require parties to declare where they had got their money from – a legacy of the Troubles. We might never have found out that the DUP’s Brexit campaign was bankrolled by the Constitutional Research Council (CRC), a shadowy group headed by a former Scottish Conservative Party chairman and parliamentary candidate, Richard Cook.The CRC doesn’t file accounts and has no public face. We have no idea where it gets its money – and the only person who knows, Cook, isn’t saying. Meanwhile, his own business dealings have come under intense scrutiny.READ MORE: SNP calls for investigation into ‘shady business’ of Vote Leave fundingAll of this has been reported over the past 18 months. The journalists Peter Geoghegan and Adam Ramsay, writing for Open Democracy, have been the most dogged, but they’ve been abetted by other outlets.            The latest revelations about Cook’s previous activities were the product of an investigation by BBC Northern Ireland, and were picked up and reported by BBC Scotland. Cook is an elusive character, but was doorstepped by Channel 4 News and challenged to reveal where the CRC’s money came from. When the CRC was first named by the DUP, the news was splashed on the front page of the Herald, and the story had also been reported by its sister paper, the Sunday Herald, and other publications.The DUP donation has been linked to wider claims of cooperation between different Brexit campaigns in breach of electoral spending law, stemming from the widely reported Cambridge Analytica controversy. The central allegation is that money was passed to different groups to avoid legal spending limits – a claim that has been denied, but which is under investigation by the Electoral Commission.The facts are that the DUP spent £32,000 with data firm AIQ, which also received 40 per cent of the official Vote Leave campaign budget, as well as nearly £675,000 from another campaign group, BeLeave. When the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie told MPs he was “absolutely convinced” the spending represented a breach of electoral law, that was reported in The Scotsman.All this serves as a lengthy run up to this: when Nicola Sturgeon echoed the Twitter hordes by saying she was “surprised there aren’t more media questions being asked” about what the SNP is calling ‘dark money’, I shared her surprise.            Engaging with people who question the how, why and why not of stories in the Scottish media is usually pointless – they are almost always motivated by political partisanship, a deep attachment to conspiracy theory, and a lack of understanding about how the news today works. Those traits shouldn’t be encouraged.If critics want to see what is a complicated story delved into more deeply, then they have to accept that the biggest problem with the so-called ‘mainstream’ media in Scotland is that there isn’t enough of it – that sort of work takes resources, mainly time. Many of the wounds of the media industry were self-inflicted. It doesn’t help for elected politicians to keep punching them. Above all, the details already uncovered in the story of the DUP’s Brexit cash have amply demonstrated that rules around political donations lack transparency, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. In a world were ‘calling out’ something is seen as akin to political action, the media’s critics have somehow convinced themselves the problem is that not enough is being written. Actually, it’s that not enough is being done.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.
