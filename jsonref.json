We spoke to the experts to find out. Q: If I’m displaying symptoms, do I still need to isolate?“The most important thing is to follow the law, so if you’ve got symptoms you have to self-isolate for 10 days in your home and it’s really important people continue to do this,” says Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge and a member of the UK government Science Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). “There may perhaps be people who think: ‘Well, why can’t I go for a walk outside in the countryside if I’m not going to see anybody?’, and I completely understand that argument. But there are millions of people living in apartments and if they were to venture outside, they’d be sharing corridors and stairwells and touching multiple surfaces. We can’t have one rule for one and another rule for others. It’s about the risks to the wider society and my personal view is that the rules are proportionate and very reasonable. Especially when you compare 10 days of isolation with the lockdowns we’ve already been in – it’s a small ask comparatively.” Q: Is it really safe to socialise outside?“When we are outdoors, thinking about the airborne route of transmission, the level of concentration of any virus in our vicinity is much lower and so the risk is lower too,” says Fitzgerald, who also specialises in airflow research. “The amount of outdoor air that’s sweeping away any virus being emanated from a person is enormous, and we can’t begin to practically replicate that kind of environment within an indoor environment.” Q: Won’t opening the windows have the same effect?“Opening the windows is great if you’re indoors but it’s nowhere near as good as being outdoors,” says Fitzgerald. “Think about it, when you’re stood outside, it’s very rare that it’s perfectly still – there’s usually a very small wind and when you run the numbers and figure out the volume flux of air passing you that’s not virus-laden, it’s enormous. When you’re outside, there are fewer surfaces for you to touch which, for example, somebody might have coughed on. Surface touching risks are also lower outdoors because things such as the rain and ultraviolet light from the sun can deactivate the virus more easily than in a dark, indoor environment.” Q: How safe is outdoor swimming or group sports?“Outdoor sports are relatively low risk but I would encourage people to also think about their overall wellbeing, including mental health, when it comes to the risks you’re exposing yourself to as you enter into society,” says Fitzgerald. She adds: “This isn’t purely about the virus – we also need to think about the wider impacts of isolation, loneliness and a lack of socialisation. It’s about balancing those risks.” Q: How can we keep safe as we start to socialise in larger groups?“One of the challenges as we start seeing friends and family is that it’s incredibly difficult for people to maintain a social distance from loved ones,” says Rogers. “And if you have young children it’s very difficult to explain to them why they’re not allowed to crawl over everyone or play with the other children. If you’re meeting up with another household or group, try to plan it in an environment that is as safe as possible. Have those honest conversations now – people are more willing and likely to stick to plans that are made in advance.” Q: If we’ve had the vaccine, do the rules still apply?“The vaccines are amazing and one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of a generation, but they’re not a silver bullet,” says Rogers. “Think about somebody who has had bypass surgery because their diet and exercise were poor. They can have that medical fix, but if they don’t change their behaviours, they’ll never realise their full potential. I see vaccines in the same way – they’re a powerful weapon we can deploy against the virus but they’re only going to reach their full potential if we wrap these other behavioural elements around them.” Q: How can we make our homes safer for visitors when they’re allowed to pass through to gardens?“Keep the windows open and if you’ve got two bathrooms, have one toilet for guests and one for the household,” suggests Fitzgerald. “If not, can you provide two towels – one for guests, one for others? Ventilating the house before and after your guests have arrived is key – ventilating before they arrive is helpful in case you happen to have an infectious person in your vicinity, therefore reducing the risk to your guests. Ventilating after guests have left is important because if one of them happens to be infectious, this will reduce the risk to your own household.” And remember, it’s not permitted for people to meet indoors until 17 May – when six people or two households will be able to come together. Q: Is there anything else we should remember?“While we’re still in this reasonably precarious state, the most important thing is to think: ‘It’s not about me, it’s about others,’” says Fitzgerald. “It’s about the wider community. Certainly in the first lockdown, we got the sense of real selflessness in society and we need to try to remember these measures aren’t just in place to protect you as an inidual, it’s about thinking of others. Particularly as we emerge from lockdown – since, the more compliant we are now, the quicker the incident rate is going to come down and the sooner society can start functioning again. So it’s really about trying to get out of this as quickly as we can, which means complying with the rules as much as possible.” This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

The largest party was 24 people in one apartment, while the average gathering size was six people.UCD students living in residences who were found to have attended such gatherings were sanctioned with warning letters, fines ranging from €25 to €250 and a number of incidents were referred to be dealt with under the student discipline procedure.UCD Students’ Union president Conor Anderson said he had represented several residents at disciplinary hearings and he took the view that “to put the blame entirely on students is a little bit short sighted”.“It was not a good public health intervention on behalf of UCD to bring students back to campus residences. We’re talking about 19-21 year-olds living together on campus in the middle of lockdowns. I don’t know what the university expected,” he said.He noted the opinion of students on campus towards the public health guidelines was “ided” with “many in favour and compliant”. However, he said there were also students “who think the rules don’t apply to them or who don’t care, and who are willing to put their social life ahead of public health advice”.Trinity College Dublin recorded four unauthorised gatherings in the campus residences, with the number of attendees ranging between four and eight people. Students were required to pay fines of up to €200 and to write letters of apology.Maynooth University said that while residents were “advised of their responsibilities under the Covid-19 regulations and how to live as a household”, throughout the semester the campus patrol team had occasion to interact with groups 134 times for unauthorised guests in their apartments.The majority of these were for one or more guests in their apartment and 20 were for “gatherings”. The sanctions imposed for Covid-19 violations at Maynooth included breach of license to reside, making the person ineligible for on campus accommodation in future years.University College Cork received reports of eight parties in campus accommodation buildings for the same period. Forty UCC students were identified as having attended the parties, some of whom were involved in “multiple gatherings”. Several students were sanctioned by the university.National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) did not release data regarding gatherings on campus residences as the campus accommodation is under the auspices of a private limited company, not subject to FOI. Dublin City University’s campus residences are also a separate commercial company.The Garda has issued its 20,000th fine for breaches of the Covid-19 regulations, including 3,500 fines handed out for organising or attending house parties.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Nowhere near what is neededCommitment from world\u0026rsquos biggest polluters comes days before virtual summit hosted by Biden on the issueClimate experts highlighted \u0026lsquofundamental flaw\u0026rsquo in letter to Coalition leaders"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland.

The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"donnelly abandons his proposal to examine vaccinating under 30s early","story":"Under-30s will not be vaccinated against older age groups,  Stephen Donnelly has saidMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly has abandoned his proposal to investigate whether under-30s should be vaccinated against Covid-19 ahead of older age groups.The Minister also said on Sunday “we are ahead of the best-case scenario we were given four weeks ago” for cases of the virus and that the R number, or rate at which the virus is reproduced, remained below 1.This “puts us in a very positive position to talk about May, June, July” and the easing of restrictions, the Minister added.Mr Donnelly created consternation yesterday when he told The  he had asked officials to investigate the possibility of revising the order of priority for receiving the vaccine to favour people in the 18-30 age group.After what he described as a “rocky week” for the State’s vaccination programme, Mr Donnelly said the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn had told him the transmission data did not support changing the age-based vaccine priority approach currently being used.“There is no plan to do this, and there is no proposal to do this,” Mr Donnelly said on Sunday.“All I was doing was checking in with the deputy CMO to say ‘where we at?’ on the transmission data. He said: ‘it isn’t there’, and that’s it.”In an interview on Newtalk’s On the Record with Gavan Reilly earlier, Mr Donnelly said: “there was no plan, there is no forecast and nothing was being floated. I was simply asked a direct question ‘is this something you had looked into’, and I said ‘yeah, yeah, it is. I’d looked for an update and the update is ‘this is not something that would be supported by the data’.”HSE director general Paul Reid on Saturday had said he was unaware of any proposal to change the vaccination priority list. Some senior officials were said to fear a spike in cases among younger people once society begins to reopen, as under-30s are more likely than other age groups to socialise together in large numbers.However, Mr Reid said the HSE was continuing to work on the list that focuses on older cohorts and medically vulnerable groups. Prioritising Covid-19 vaccinations for people based on their age remains the best approach if the aim of the inoculation programme is “harm reduction”, he said. The public health advice has been that vaccination should be based on age.Mr Donnelly also spoke to RTÉ’s This Week, and when asked why he did not tell the HSE or Government colleagues that this was something he was looking at and he replied: “I didn’t because there was no plan and no proposal.”Asked about the possibility of spacing out doses of the vaccine being considered by Cabinet this week, Mr Donnelly said there is no memo being written on it “at the moment” but that he expected a recommendation “in the coming days”.He confirmed Niac had not been asked about increasing the time lag in the administration of second doses.The Irish Mail on Sunday cited a Cabinet source as saying outdoor retail and click-and-collect services would resume at the beginning of May and suggesting the ban on inter-county travel would end at the start of June.Mr Donnelly said the full opening of construction is under consideration as well as the Government looking at retail, restaurants and hospitality.“We are ahead of the best-case scenario we were given four weeks ago” for cases of the virus and the R number or rate at which the virus is reproduced remained below 1.This “puts us in a very positive position to talk about May, June, July” and the easing of restrictions,” the Minister said.Mr Donnelly also said he would be “very, very happy” to meet Archbishops following a Sunday Times report that they were seeking a meeting and are to receive legal advice about the potential infringement of religious freedoms.He insisted churches were not being targeted and it was about public health and indoor gatherings that are high risk.Mr Donnelly said he had spoken to the deputy CMO about the so-called Indian variant following a surge in cases in India. The Minister said the National Public Health Emergency Team would be considering that variant this week and that there is concern about it, although he was not aware of any cases so far in Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"republic uk and eu agree to tackle northern ireland unrest","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney was in London holding meetings with key political figures.  Brussels, London and Dublin agreed to work together towards solutions following unrest in Northern Ireland.The agreement was reached in a series of meetings on Thursday aimed at putting relations on a “constructive” footing after a difficult start for the North’s post-Brexit arrangements.European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic and his British counterpart Lord David Frost held a dinner meeting in Brussels intended to provide “a political steer for follow-up discussions that will take place between both teams”, said a commission spokesman.It came as the British and Irish governments agreed to a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) in the coming months to discuss issues of concern in Northern Ireland.“We haven’t agreed a date yet but certainly I think the governments are in agreement that there should be a BIIGC meeting and I think we’ll continue to talk about the appropriate time for that,” Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told The . Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis earlier this week dismissed the idea that the intergovernmental conference should meet to discuss recent unrest in the North, on the grounds that policing is among the powers devolved to Stormont. The intergovernmental conference was established under the Belfast Agreement as a forum for co-operation between the two governments on Northern Ireland. It has not met since Boris Johnson became British prime minister.Mr Coveney was in London holding meetings with key political figures including Lord Frost, in what Mr Coveney described as “a very good meeting . . . on a personal level” and “a good, honest engagement that explored in some detail some of the issues in terms of what’s possible and what’s not”.Brussels and London remain far apart on some issues, with Britain seeking flexibility while the commission has said pragmatic solutions can be found only if the Northern Ireland protocol is implemented fully. The European Parliament has yet to ratify the EU-UK trade deal, which is in place provisionally until the end of the month.

Photograph: Jim HuylebroekThe New York TimesAfghanistan has a complicated relationship with time. And America has a complicated relationship with revenge. Between these two truths, tragedy blossomed.Awash in grief and anger, the US invaded Afghanistan after 911 to hunt down Osama bin Laden and punish the Taliban for letting him turn a maze of caves into a launching pad to attack America.Yet despite the lessons the Soviets learned in 10 hard years there fighting ghostly warriors who disappeared into the mountains, US officials and generals never absorbed this simple fact: even the battles we won, we lost in a way. As we grasped for our own revenge what kind of revenge quest did we inspire in those who watched daisy-cutter bombs rain hellfire or a wedding party disintegrate in a flash from a US airstrike? How many enemies have we spawned trying to help Afghanistan?Taliban leaders say Americans have all the clocks, but they have all the time.The Bush administration was arrogant and ignorant about occupying this medieval moonscape. Officials thought they could bomb the bejesus out of the people who hated us so that they would never look at us cross-eyed again. We would be the swaggering hyperpower. Even Barack Obama, once so prescient on the futility of invading Iraq, was suckered by the military into a pointless surge in Afghanistan, a near tripling of troops, in 2009.I remember touring Afghanistan and Iraq with Obama’s defence secretary, Robert Gates, at the time, flying over the snow-capped mountains that make Afghanistan a natural fortress and sinkhole for empires. I asked him if the president had been rolled by the generals. “That’s ridiculous,” Gates snapped, adding: “Anybody who reads history has to approach these things with some humility because you can’t know. Nobody knows what the last chapter ever looks like.”Well, we seem to be at the last chapter, and it looks just as grim as all the other chapters of this misbegotten occupation. Small secured zonesEven then it was clear that our attempt to turn Afghanistan and Iraq into model democracies was not going well. Touring those countries, Gates could barely leave the small secured zones.At a joint news conference with Gates, our corrupt puppet Hamid Karzai needled his American sugar daddies, protesting that America was stuck because Afghanistan would not be able to get its own forces ready for 15 or 20 more years.We attended a briefing where military leaders talked about “partnering” with and “mentoring” Afghan forces, but they acknowledged that before they could get to security training they first they had to teach a vast majority of Afghan recruits to read and write.Gates told reporters he had only just learned the “eye-opener” that the Taliban was attracting so many fighters because it paid more. Generals in Afghanistan said the Taliban was giving fighters $250 to $300 a month, while the Afghan army was paying about $120. So Gates, employing the American way of throwing more money at a problem, got the recruits a raise to $240.And this pathetic bidding war with the Taliban was eight years in.We should have respected Afghanistan’s reputation as “the graveyard of empires”, and Pakistan’s deserved reputation for double-dealing. The Time magazine cover in December 2001, “The Last Days of the Taliban”, mocks us.We spent 20 years fighting in Afghanistan. But given our flat learning curve, every year there was like the first. So we were really on our first year for the 20th time, making the same mistakes over and over again.As with Vietnam, many of those in charge knew for a long time that the war was unwinnable, but they hid the evidence, giving rosy forecasts while burning through $2.2 trillion and hundreds of thousands of lives.As Douglas Lute, a three-star army general who was the Afghan war czar during the Bush and Obama administrations, told government interviewers in 2015 for the secret “Afghanistan Papers,” a project on how things went a cropper: “What are we trying to do here? We didn’t have the foggiest notion of what we were undertaking.”Many top Bush officials and neocons who mired us so deeply in the first place were absurdly demanding this past week that President Joe Biden not pull out. They are living cushy lives, enjoying big cable TV contracts and hosannas from liberals for trashing Donald Trump, while our troops have been dishonoured by their half-baked and dishonest strategies. Vengeful emotionsBefore we send our young people overseas to die we need to learn from history and understand what we’re doing, not simply acting out of vengeful emotions.As vice-president Biden was a lone voice in the Oval Office objecting to the surge in Afghanistan. He told Obama, if you let them the generals will box you in and string it out.And that’s how you end up with a “forever war”, an endeavour that becomes a self-sustaining energy source, where the objectives are redefined to infinity.Afghanistan will go down as another lesson in the folly of leaders whose egos simply do not allow them to think they are involved in a failure, so they contrive to paint it as a success.The US has built a stable of weapons that can kill people wherever it desires. Drones and bombs that can go and drop anywhere we want them to. But the US never bothered to figure out the rest of the equation.Trump was shooting from the hip, but his instinct to withdraw was right. And Biden was right to ignore dire warnings about what will happen when we leave. The Taliban cannot be trusted they’re true believers in a medieval ideology. A power-sharing arrangement with the Taliban was never going to work.“The main argument for staying longer is what each of my three predecessors have grappled with: no one wants to say that we should be in Afghanistan forever, but they insist now is not the right moment to leave,” Biden said, adding: “So when will it be the right moment to leave? One more year? Two more years? Ten more years? Ten, 20, 30 billion dollars more above the trillion we’ve already spent? ‘Not now’ – that’s how we got here.” War zoneHe talked of how he has carried a card for the past 12 years with the exact number of US troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. He spoke of his late son, Beau, his “North Star,” who was deployed to Iraq.“I’m the first president in 40 years who knows what it means to have a child serving in a war zone,” he said.Hopefully, our experience in Afghanistan will be the graveyard of America’s propensity to believe it can do whatever it wants with its military, without thinking through the consequences.How could we justify another 20 years? one Afghanistan veteran asked me, poignantly noting that there is nothing left of his friends who died in the war but names inscribed on park benches.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178\u0026#39Damaging\u0026#39 European Super League would strike at heart of football, says Boris JohnsonIrish premier warns of \u0026#39very serious harm\u0026#39 in NI if people continue to weaponise Brexit to stir isionReunited in grief: How Prince Harry spent a golden hour talking with his familyRapid Covid tests used by schoolchildren investigated for containing wrong instructionsCovid tests for holidaymakers could fall below £50 Closing playgrounds during Covid has fuelled ‘pandemic of mental health problems’ among childrenDesperate talks to secure five million jabs from India ahead of Boris Johnson\u0026#39s visitDemocratic congresswoman urges protesters to stay on streets if Derek Chauvin is clearedExclusive: Census workers appalled at being asked to repeatedly \u0026#39harass\u0026#39 innocent elderly peopleRoyal summit to decide future of monarchy to be led by Prince Charles and Prince WilliamComment: To understand the dangers of Covid passports, simply imagine an obesity equivalentRussian ballet dancer blames \u0026#39cancel culture\u0026#39 for the death of British choreographer Liam ScarlettBishops must declare outside earnings in wake of Greensill scandal, General Synod member urgesSt George\u0026#39s Chapel: inside the Royal family\u0026#39s parish churchPrinces Harry and William shared private chat, with Duchess of Cambridge acting as peacemakerPrince Philip will be buried in his final resting place after the Queen diesAll the music from Prince Philip\u0026#39s funeral, including two pieces written at his requestWhy the Queen chose loyal lady-in-waiting Lady Susan Hussey for her loneliest journeyFedEx killer able to get guns despite family warning police that he was a dangerPrestigious boarding school which boasts Queen as patron marks passing of Prince PhilipBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"crumbling faith no10s covid policies turning public conspiracy","story":"So which is it? Is the UK vaccine rollout a stunning, world-beating success – resulting in the radical reduction of cases, hospital admissions and deaths which can be seen clearly in the daily recorded figures? Or is it largely irrelevant to what progress has been made in defeating the spread of the virus? Is it actually the case (verbatim from the Prime Minister): “that the reduction in hospitalisations and in deaths and in infections has not been achieved by the new vaccination programme”? It depends on whether you listen to Boris Johnson before or after the middle of last week.Until Black Tuesday, when the Prime Minister, for reasons known only to himself and presumably the person (or people) who told him to say it, decided to trash his own Government’s greatest triumph – thus not only committing a bizarre act of political self-harm but, more seriously, attempting to undermine public morale and national pride – the British vaccine programme was seen as a modern miracle.It was an unprecedented achievement not just of scientific research, but of the dedication of medical staff, the public-spirited voluntary efforts of thousands of ordinary people, and the willing cooperation of the great majority of the population who made the rational, responsible decision to accept vaccination. Not only was what Mr Johnson said on that last fateful Tuesday damaging to confidence in this most crucially important Government policy, but it was factually wrong – as any number of public health officials and medical experts queued up immediately to make clear.What on earth was he thinking? And since he does not make pronouncements of this kind without consultation – what on earth were the motives of those presumed “experts” who must have advised him to make it? (Who were obviously not the ones who leapt into the arena to contradict him.) The context is important: the Prime Minister was comparing the impact of the vaccination programme with that of lockdown, claiming that the former was negligible (indeed, virtually non-existent) by comparison with the latter.Maybe this is the key. He was trying to rescue the viability of lockdown which might otherwise have lost its force in the great vaccine rollout exultation. That argument might have been convincing if he had said that, in the legitimate national celebration over vaccinations, we must not lose sight of the need to maintain those lockdown restrictions which are still necessary at present...blah-blah. But he didn’t say that.What he did say seemed to imply that no vaccination programme – however comprehensive – could provide a solution to the problem and a return to genuine (not “new”) normal life. And that is a direct contradiction to what was popularly understood to be the promise from the medical and scientific experts who told us – way back in the era when our lives were first taken away – that the only ultimate answer to this dilemma lay in finding a vaccine.Now we have not just “a vaccine” but a quiverful of them, all of which seem to be remarkably effective – more so than most of the vaccines used against other diseases (even though the broadcast media insist that every new variant may, just possibly, prove resistant, etc etc). Could this be part of the problem? Were the experts taken by surprise when this sudden avalanche of vaccines arrived on the scene so quickly that they felt in danger of losing control of the discourse – and their ability to hold down public expectations?The most charitable explanation of Mr Johnson’s comment, and presumably the advice that drove it, is that some of the people in charge believed there was a real risk that the optimism would get out of hand and the whole apparatus of regulation would collapse. In their panic, they urged him to say something that was misleading, illogical and self-defeating: in effect, encouraging vaccine scepticism and undermining the Government’s own “get the jab” campaign.But in the longer term, this unfortunate and gratuitous intervention could do greater damage than any immediate effect it might have on vaccine take-up. (In fact, this appears to be negligible: people are just as eager for the jabs as ever, partly because they have been told they might not be able to travel or get into the pub without them.)In the last week, I have heard more people express serious suspicion about the Government’s authoritarian motives than at any time since this whole crisis began. Because the Prime Minister himself seemed to fling the whole question of vaccine efficacy out of the window – when it had once been presented as the be-all and end-all of pandemic solutions – there is now grave disquiet among sensible, thinking parts of the population about where this is all going and what is driving it.What would once have been thought the stuff of cult paranoia is now commonplace conversation in socially enlightened circles. The most common refrain is to the effect that either the Government and its experts were lying then, or they are lying now: that there is something sinister about their desire to maintain a pretext for totalitarian measures.For what it is worth, I personally do not believe that there is a cabal of Maoists at the top level of the Government who wish to maintain repressive social controls forever. But I am finding it harder and harder to argue with the people who do. There is now a real sense that frightening the population into obedience is more important than telling the truth, and that faith in the Government’s promises – even in a crisis – is for mugs.There is one possible explanation which is less diabolical but equally destructive: that the Government has taken account of the fear that still prevails in the country and wants to address it. To those who tell the opinion polls that they do not want to be set free yet, reassurance is being offered.But anxiety is a natural (indeed, essential) part of the human apparatus.

The boxes also contain a leaflet from the manufacturer, Xiamen, which could imply that the tests are only to be used by people suspected of having Covid by a clinician.Professor Allyson Pollock, a public health expert at Newcastle University, said: The whole mass testing programme is confusing, chaotic and the antithesis of good public health practice.“If you do mass testing you need to do proper evaluation beforehand, which would identify problems like this.”“Lateral flow testing should have gone through the UK National Screening Committee for proper evaluation.”She added: “Mass testing is a complex public health intervention and is no different from medicines and vaccines – there is real potential for harm.”Another scientist, whose children were given the out-of-date leaflet, described the packages as deeply confusing.If symptomatic people use lateral flow instead and fail to report their result, then we\u0027ll lose control and it won\u0027t give contact tracers a chance, they said.A recent Cochrane review – an analysis of 64 studies – found that the less effective devices pick up about 72 per cent of symptomatic cases, and only 58 per cent of infections where the person was asymptomatic. This applied to the Innova test, which is used very widely in the UK.The findings have led some experts to predict, as levels of coronavirus in the community decline, that mass testing with lateral flow devices will do more harm than good by throwing up more false positives than true ones.However, the Government is staunchly backing the programme.On Friday a Downing Street spokesman said lateral flow tests had been “rigorously evaluated and we believe they are both accurate and incredibly useful in terms of being able to spot asymptomatic cases of the virus”.A spokesman for MHRA said: “I can confirm that we are looking into this.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"india not left covid 19","story":"NewsIndia not left off Covid- travel ban red list over trade deal, Minister insistsBoris Johnson is due to fly to India next week, despite mounting calls for the visit to be axedmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  APR NewsBoris Johnson still plans to go ahead with his trip later this month \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Labour urged the Prime Minister to postpone the visit again. Shadow Communities Secretary Steve Reed said: “There are new iants emerging all around the world, the Government is telling people don’t travelyou don’t have to absolutely travel and I can’t see why the Prime Minister can’t conduct his business with the Indian government by Zoom. “So many of us do that these days and I think the Prime Minister, all of us in public le, need to try and set an example so I’d much rather the Prime Minister did it by Zoom than by travelling to India.” At least  cases of the Indian Covid- iant have been found in Britain, with cases continuing to soar in India.

Shadow Culture Secretary and Tottenham Hotspur devotee Jo Stevens will be at Wembley on Sunday to roar on her side in the Carabao Cup Final against Manchester City. Ms Stevens, who was hospitalised with coronavirus earlier this year, said: “Like all fans I’m desperate to get back into stadiums to watch live sport. Watching on TV is great, but it’s not the same as being at a ground, watching your team, surrounded by fellow supporters. “I can’t wait to be at Wembley to watch Spurs in the Carabao Cup Final on Sunday.”  She urged the Government to adopt Labouraposs three-point plan to “protect the great British summer and get sports fans back into stadiums”. Its blueprint calls on ministers to:Publish the full results from the sporting and cultural pilots so lessons can be learned quickly, adaptations made and the potential value of mass event testing be maximised. Sort out test, trace and isolate,to prevent further surges of the virus – mass testing needs to go hand in hand with community, public health-led contact tracing to find cases, backed by proper financial support so people who are ill can isolate. Quarantine arrivals from all countries, with exemptions for some professions, to protect the country from dangerous new iants.Ms Stevens said: “There has been a lot of talk from the Prime Minister about bringing more sporting events to the UK later this year, but we can only do thisit is safe, so itaposs important that all the lessons from the pilot events are published and learnt from quickly by the Government, to avoid another situation where public expectations are raised with promises that can’t be delivered. By adopting our three-point plan, fans and families alike, can start to look forward to a brilliant British summer, assured that they will be kept safe. “I’ll be playing my part by getting tested ahead of going to Wembley – we are calling on the Government to play their part too.

Her closest aides have been a source of support throughout the pandemic, during which time she has been unable to see her own family for long periods. Among those closest to her, thereports, are senior dresser Angela Kelly, head groom, Terry Pendry, private secretary Sir Edward Young and page of the backstairs, Paul Whybrew. The group was christened aposHMS Bubbleapos, a joke the Queen and Prince Philip were said to find very amusing, by Vice-Admiral Sir Tony Johnstone-Burt, master of the household. In an email to staff the former naval officer likened their situation to being out at sea. He wrote: “There are  Royal Household staff inside the Bubble, and it struck me that our predicament is not dissimilar to my former le in the Royal Navy on a long overseas deployment. “Indeed, the challenges that we are facing, whether self-isolating alone at home, or with our close household and families, have parallels with being at sea, away from home for many months, and having to deal with a sense of dislocation, anxiety and uncertainty. Regardless of the roles we perform, we do them to an exceptional standard to allow the Queen and other members to do theirduty to the best of their ability, too.”Ms Kelly, , is said to have struck up a close relationship with the monarch. The senior dresser, who grew up in a council house in Merseyside, is said to know her inside out, and has been visiting her every day. Mr Pendry is expected to be on hand when the Queen spends time with her favourite ponies, Carltonlima Emma and Balmoral Fern, in the coming weeks. Mr Whybrew, nicknamed aposTall Paulapos is reputed to be a calming influence, and accompanies the Queen when she settles down to watch TV. He famously featured in the famous James Bond sketch for the  Olympics alongside Daniel Craig. She will also be heavily reliant on her ladies-in-waiting for support, it is reported.  These include Lady Susan Hussey, Dame Mary Anne Morrison, Lady Elton, Dame Annabel Whitehead and the Countess of Airlie, . In spite of her heartbreak at losing her husband of more than  years, the Queen is understood to be determined to get back to work, having already held a telephone conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Yesterday she was seen having to keep her distance from her family because they are not members of her bubble. However she is allowed to meet them outdoors, with sons Prince Andrew and Prince Edward living nearby. Royal expert Penny Junor has said the image of the grieving Queen sitting by herself reflected the “remarkable woman” that the monarch is.

Charlotte Knowles and Shaun Yates have spent the last year consumed by watching YouTube videos and addicted to Pinterest so they could renovate their apartment without spending a fortune. Neither of them had any DIY experience before they started the total refurbishment - but it has now gone so well they are considering buying another property to do up.With the help of Youtube videos and Facebook Marketplace, the couple completed the majority of the work by themselves - and they canapost believe the dference itaposs made, reports the Liverpool Echo. In the space of  months, they have renovated the whole apartment including the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom and hallway at a cost of around £,. Charlotte, , told the Echo: We thought weaposre never going to get the opportunity to do this again. Weaposre both  year oldaposs and we did it all following Youtube videos. My partner built everything and I designed it. He doesnapost have any qualications in building or plumbing, heaposs done everything himself. Before they began the project, Charlotte said the apartment had damp problems, a grubby kitchen and the wallpaper was hanging off in the bedroom. But they didnapost let the size of the job put them off and took inspiration from their favourite coffee shop in Rock Ferry when it came to design ideas. Charlotte said: Iaposve been addicted to Pinterest, I took snippets of little pictures and said aposletaposs do thatapos and then Iaposve sketched it out and heaposs built it.  The biggest transformation has definitely been the kitchen, weaposve completely changed the whole layout. Weaposve done everything ourselves apart from the plastering and the moving of the gas pipes. In the kitchen, the couple uncovered an original brick fireplace that had been plastered over. They used scaffolding boards to create a kitchen table and pulled apart pallet crates and cut them to size before sanding and staining them for the wood on the walls.When it came to finding furniture, Charlotte found bargains on Facebook Marketplace and the likes of eBay and Gumtree.You need to look hard and look often, she said. Decide what youaposre after and what youaposre prepared to spend and look all the time.  Charlotte also repurposed old furniture from friends and family including an old Chesterfield sofa which she used to create leather bar stools and a booth in the kitchen. The Rangemaster double oven, which cost in the range of £, from new, was also given to the couple secondhand by a friend for free. If it wasnapost for lockdown, Charlotte said they would never have had the time to embark on such a big project in the first place. But after coming to the end of the renovation, they have caught the DIY bug and are keen to buy another property to renovate and sell on in the future.

Daniel Parry said the animal jumped on his toddler, Luca, as they were leaving a playground in Liverpool. The -year-old quickly ran to his son, who had teeth marks on his arm and flesh hanging off, and the dog let go.The owner allegedly fled the scene while workers from a nearby play centre used their first aid kit to stop the bleeding, reports Liverpool Echo. Doctors later told Daniel it was lucky Luca did not suffer nerve or artery damage. The -year-old, from Wooton Village, now wants to raise awareness about the incident to stop other children from being attacked by the same dog. Daniel described the park as a safe haven for him and Luca throughout lockdown. But while leaving the playground on Saturday, a dog on a lead suddenly jumped up and attacked the youngster. Daniel said: My son was attacked where the gate was towards the playground. There were two dogs strapped up, with a man looking into the playground. They didnapost seem very feisty or anything like that. We walked around them and Luca was next to me, but all of a sudden one of the dogs ran out. The dog must have had an extension on its lead because it got out so far and bit my sonaposs arm. I instinctively reacted, so the dog must have panicked and left him. But it happened all so fast, the dog jumped on my son. I noticed there were teeth marks on his forearm and I just ran to him straight away. I looked at the dog owner asto say aposwhat the h**l apos, and I looked to his forearm and he had a big cut in his arm, the teeth had gone in and there was flesh hanging out.

Modelling by the travel industry suggests that Gibraltar, Iceland, Malta and New Zealand could also be deemed safe for travel when non-essential foreign trips are allowed again from next month. However Australia and New Zealand are currently closed for foreign arrivals to protect their populations from the virus, which has killed more than three million people worldwide. Everywhere  would either be amber or red - meaning people have to quarantine when they arrive in the UK. The countries have been identied by analysts based on the governmentaposs risk criteria for travel. Under Boris Johnsonaposs roadmap out of lockdown, non-essential foreign travel, which is currently banned, could be allowed again from May Covid cases in the UK continue to fall.A report by Robert Boyle, former strategy chief at BA, and circulated in the travel industry, said that most of Europe will be classied as amber or red - meaning quarantine will be required, according to The .It ranks  countries based on vaccination rates, infection levels, iants and capacity for genome sequencing - the four criteria used by the UK government. People arriving from countries listed as red would be required to quarantine at a hotel at a cost of £, - making them far less appealing as holiday destinations. France, the Netherlands, Turkey, Croatia, Sweden, Belgium and Luxembourg should be red under the criteria, researchers found, but this is unlikely to happen for political reasons, the report said.

When she moved into her house in January , she embarked on a mission to modernise the bathroom...We’d been saving up to have the bathroom professionally redecorated and managed to get together £, but the pandemic threw a spanner in the works.The bathroom was so outdated and never our style. The walls were a butter-yellow colour and the tiles were cream. It really needed freshening up. Because of the lockdown, our financial priorities had changed. We didn’t want to risk using the money we had saved in case we lost our jobs or got sick. And as we wanted to sell the property soon, it seemed silly to get an expensive decorator.What do you think  Share your views in the comments below...I set myself a budget of £ and did the bathroom transformation last March when lockdown first started.The main cost was the shower screen which was £ from eBay and we replaced the shower for £ and taps for £.The tile paint was only £ a tin and it made the world of dference to the dreary walls. It was tricky to use but after the first coat I got the hang of it. I also picked up some budget vinyl flooring from eBay for £ and Ben helped me to lay it. I upcycled the units by adding brass handles and a rattan table runner and made a herringbone worktop out of scrap wood from the garden. It was a labour of love but worth all the hard work. We were so impressed, especially as it cost a fraction of the money we’d planned to spend. We put the house on the market in September and the estate agent said our bathroom makeover definitely added value to the house. It was so great to hear as we’d only spent £ in total.

Brian blamed his motheraposs frightened and confused state for her failure to point out the mix-up as it was happening. He added: Mumaposs a very quiet woman anyway and has been on her own since Dad died in . However, she did later tell us that she couldnapost work out why she was being called by a dferent name. Also, given the woman sheaposd been mistaken for has dementia, my guess is any attempt to point out it wasnapost her house was possibly put down to her being a bit muddled.Who knows, she may have even looked at the unfamiliar surroundings and thought weaposd decided to put her in a care home.

The only royal who showed him any sympathy was his uncle, Prince Andrew, who is himself an outsider, sources claim. Harry joined relatives for the first time in more than a year as they said farewell to the Duke of Edinburgh, who died on April  aged . According to the Mail on Sunday, Princess Anne, Prince Edward and his we Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, did not acknowledge him before or during the service at Windsor Castle. Only Prince Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties after a disastrous interview with the BBC in , sympathised with him, a source told the newspaper. They said: He knows from Sarah Ferguson – and now first-hand – how it feels to be the outsider, which Harry very much is. As far as the others are concerned, there is a deep sense of protection towards the Queen and resentment towards Harry. There is little sympathy for him after what he and Meghan said on Oprah. In the bombshell interview, Harry and Meghan made a string of allegations about the family. Meghan said she was offered no support when she suffered a mental health crisis, and Harry claimed royals including his father and brother were trapped in their role.  The couple also alleged that an unnamed royal had asked about son Archieaposs skin colour, suggesting that they would have a problemhe was dark skinned. The Mail on Sunday reports that some family members had failed to even acknowledge Harry before or during the service because they believe he had behaved appallingly. Yesterday Harry and William were seen talking to each other following the service for their grandfather, sparking hopes of a possible reconciliation.

She said the pair went on to exchange well over a hundred letters, each of hers scented with French perfume, which she often does. But their friendship truly took off when the Duke invited Liona aboard his private plane in  – and personally flew her from Manchester to a naval base in Norfolk. What do you think of this story  Let us know in the comments section below. She told us: “I was so shocked when he took the controls himself. It was a bit bumpy.” Liona,  – who was photographed with the plane’s mascot, a cuddly hedgehog named Lunch – recounted the “surreal” flight in his Hawker Siddeley  in her autobiography. It tells how she “chatted with the crew, sat in the Queen’s chair, tested out her ‘loo’ and nibbled on crustless cucumber sandwiches” while Philip visited a local bakery. The Prince had offered her the lt after a performance in Leeds for the Outward Bound Trust, of which he was patron and chairman until .  Her book In My Own Key tells how, after landing, he gave her “a quick kiss on the cheek and vanished into the morning rain”. Although born in London, classical guitarist Liona grew up in Canada and was first introduced to the Queen and Prince Philip after performing at a private dinner at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa in . Some years later she posted him her CD and says she was “stunned” when he not only replied but continued responding to further letters she sent. “He always wrote back right away,” Liona told us. “He was very prompt. I sent him poetry – he said my lyrics were brilliant. I was thrilled and never took it for granted.  “He became one of the most wonderful anchors of my le. I loved those trips to the post office.” Liona, who has recorded  albums and worked with stars including Eric Clapton and Olivia Newton-John, found herself invited to royal events as the friendship blossomed. She recalls sitting next to the Duke at a dinner for the World Wide Fund for Nature in Toronto in . Liona says: “The places were set and I didn’t have a fork, so he scampered off to the kitchen to get me one. You’d expect a page or someone to do that. “The Nylons were playing, he sang along to The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”  In her autobiography she calls Philip “a delightful dinner companion”. She writes: “Was this really the Queen’s husband chuckling mischievously as he told me how, one night balancing on a wooden ‘loo’ outside in the rain, he was bitten by mosquitoes and blackflies on unmentionable body parts he’d neglected to spray ” Liona also shared with us some of the letters Philip wrote to her. She obscured some of his words to protect personal details.  In one, written in November , Philip tells her: “Fundraising events are rarely unmitigated pleasure!! But your company at Ontorio Place [sic] made it a very happy evening for me”. He also reached out to Liona after an earthquake hit Calornia in . She says: “He sent a telegram saying he hoped our house was okay. It was so kind. I framed it.” Two years later Liona had an invitation to perform at Windsor Castle and stay overnight with her then husband. She wrote a song especially and Philip introduced her to the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. Liona told us how she sneaked in a camera and summoned the “chutzpah” to ask for a photo with the Queen and Prince Philip during a tour of Henry VII’s armour. Speaking from her home in Palm Beach, Florida, she tells how she often spritzes her letters to the Duke in French perfume and sent him “sweet” Valentine’s cards right up until this year, when lockdown prevented her. In her second book, No Remedy for Love, she recalled how the Duke once “teased” her for using Beverley Hills stationery, telling her: “Get some new writing paper!”  Asking him once about artwork for an album, she says he “chuckled mischievously and suggested I wear three maple leaves and nothing !” But after asking him for a hug in Toronto to “thank him for all the years of letter-writing and friendship”, she told us how he instead “shook his head and kissed me on each cheek”. Liona says the Duke “hand-typed, or hand-wrote all his letters in pretty good handwriting” – writing “Dear Liona” and signing off “Yours ever” or “Love, Philip”. And she reveals: “He was insulted when I once askedhe dictated the letters. I always used to wonder how he had time to write to me.” In a note sent from Sandringham in , the Duke wrote: “The older I get, the quicker birthdays seem to come.” He signed it, “With love, Philip”. In two letters in  he detailed his excitement about VE Day celebrations and complimented Liona’s latest CD. And in  he confided in one letter that he “didn’t expect to live that much longer,” she said. It prompted her to arrange a visit to Windsor Castle the following March, in which she played him guitar and says he gave her his blessing to mention their friendship in her books. Liona, known in Canada as the “First Lady of Guitar”, told how she dedicated a song about horses to the Duke after he told her the animals are “some of my best friends”.  He also confided about the dficulties of royal le, telling her it “hasn’t always been easy and maybe it had ended his freedom,” she says. Telling how she even sent the Duke postcards, she adds: “I think he lived vicariously through my adventures.” Though he stopped sending physical letters a year ago, Liona says Philip’s most recent correspondence was an email in March via his private secretary “wishing my sister and I condolences on losing our mother”.

While the lowering of the coffin normally takes place in private, the moment was shown on live television and online streams in a historic first for Britainaposs Royal Family. The Duke of Edinburgh, who died aged  on April , is the th royal to be interred inside the Royal Vault, though it will not be his final resting place. When the Queen dies, he will be transferred to the gothic church’s King George VI memorial chapel to lie alongside his devoted we of  years.  The monarch, , wore a face mask and sat alone during the socially-distanced funeral, which was held with just  mourners due to Englandaposs coronavirus lockdown rules.An electric motor was used to lower Philip incredibly slowly from the Quire to the Royal Vault as the Dean of Windsor read the Commendation and the Garter King of Arms proclaimed the y list of the duke’s regal styles and titles. Part of the lowering was filmed by the BBC cameras, which moved away at times to focus on other elements, including the Garter King of Arms, a piper’s lament, and the Actions Stations naval battle cry by buglers. After the coffin descended, the open rectangular space leading to the vault could be seen in the floor of the Quire. The Duke of Sussex, after bowing his head in front of the altar, was seen to glance down briefly towards the open vault as he made his way out of the chapel at the end of the service. Philipaposs coffin had rested on a catafalque in the Quire and was draped with his personal standard, and decorated with a wreath of flowers and his Naval cap and sword. He personally selected the regalia – the medals and decorations conferred on him by the UK and Commonwealth countries – together with his Royal Air Force wings and Field Marshal’s baton, which were pre-positioned on nine cushions on the altar in the chapel. Speaking before the funeral, Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, described the moment as “unique in British royal history”. Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family.

Usually, the movement of the coffin into the vault beneath the floor of the Quire of St George’s Chapel would take place in private, Mr Little said. He said: “I think it will be unique in British royal historythe public get to see this on television. “Clearly it’s an intimate moment, usually only witnessed by the Royal Family. “I think it will be regarded as too private. I think it is the sort of thing you might see at funerals in European countries, but not in Britain.”  The Royal Vault - behind a set of iron gates and about ft underground - is the final resting place of a range of kings and queens. It was created between  and  for George III, who died in  and is one of three kings buried there. Also interred in the vault are George IV and William IV. Others buried there include George III’s we Queen Charlotte and their daughter Princess Amelia, George IV’s daughter Princess Charlotte and Queen Victoria’s father the Duke of Kent.  Princess Margaret, who died in , was cremated and her ashes were initially placed in the Royal Vault, before being moved to the George VI memorial chapel with her parents’ coffins when the Queen Mother died just weeks later. The princess wanted to be cremated because she found the alternative royal burial ground at Frogmore in Windsor Great Park too “gloomy”. Lady Glenconner – a lelong friend of the princess – said in  that the princess preferred the memorial chapel instead. “She told me that she found Frogmore very gloomy,” Lady Glenconner said. “I think she’d like to be with the late King, which she will now be. There’s room I think for her to be with him now.” At George VI’s funeral in , the king’s coffin was lowered into the vault but the proceedings were not televised so the working operation of the motor has not been broadcast before, Mr Little said. Photographs of the occasion taken from a distance show the new Queen Elizabeth II stood in front of the space in the floor after the coffin had descended. She sprinkled earth into the vault and was stood with the widowed Queen Mother, her sister Princess Margaret and the King’s sister Princess Mary. Coffins are slowly lowered about ft and then carried along a passageway and through the iron gates into the vault.  The King George VI memorial chapel, where the Queen and Philip will rest alongside each other, houses the remains of George VI, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. George VI was interred into the Royal Vault first and moved to the memorial chapel annex when it was built  years later. The central feature of the pale stone King George VI memorial chapel, which was added on to the north side of St George’s behind the North Quire Aisle in , is a black stone slab set into the floor. It is inscribed with “George VI” and “Elizabeth” in gold lettering and accompanied by their years of birth and death. Earlier monarchs were buried under Westminster Abbey in a Royal Vault under the Henry VII Chapel, but it was almost full by , and George III commissioned a new vault under the eventual Albert Memorial Chapel in Windsor.  That was the main burial spot for the royals for a time.When George III died in , it was noted that the Royal Vault at St Georgeaposs Chapel had  low tombs, about  inches high, and several feet long and wide, in the centre for sovereigns and their wives, the Times reported.The vault had space for more bodies on shelves of York stone, behind grilles. A Times reporter was allowed into the vault before George IVaposs funeral in , and he reported that behind the gates were seen some of the richly ornamented coffins of the Royal Family on the shelves between the gothic octagon-shaped columns.  The report added: The reflection of lamp light upon these coffins irradiated the gloom of the tombhouse. The coffins of George III and the Princess Charlotte were seen more plainly than the others. There is no coffin at present on the  low tombs in the centre of the mausoleum, which are intended to take the remains of sovereigns. His late Majestyaposs will be the first. It became easier for royals to visit their dead ancestors when a stone staircase was built sometime around , and electric lighting was installed in . After visiting the funeral of her brother, Prince Francis of Teck, in , Queen Mary noted: The vault looks very nice now, and is well lighted and arranged. The King [Edward VII] lies on the stone in the centre for the present.

Most of us are familiar with the swept up, bouffant style.But a private photograph of Princess Anne and Prince Charles watching polo with their father at Smithaposs Lawn, Windsor Great Park, shows that actually, the princessaposs hair - when she was younger - was naturally blonde and very curly.Anne, now , has spoken out about her hairstyle in the past, after actress Erin Doherty, who plays a young Anne in the Crown, gave several interviews in which she claimed it took between  minutes and two hours to get right. Erin told journalists: Itaposs its own beast. Literally, I would sit in the chair, people would come in and go and come in and go, and I sat still in the same place. But it was so necessary for her character because it felt like her hair and her fashion were the way that she was able to express herself in the confined, controlled environment that she grew up in. But in her typical no nonsense way Anne was having none of it.In a programme titled Anne: The Princess Royal at , she said: Actually I read an article the other day about this, I don’t watch Netflix and The Crown, but the actress was talking about how long it took them to do their hair like I did. And Iaposm thinking, aposHow could you possibly take that long apos I mean, it takes me  or  minutes. The picture of a young Anne was posted as part of a short video reel on Prince Charlesapos instagram page, Clarence House. It appeared prior to the Duke of Edinburghaposs funeral, with Charles paying tribute to his father for his service to the Queen, his family, and the country.  A caption alongside the video reel read: My father, for I suppose the last  years, has given the most remarkable, devoted service to The Queen, to my family and to the country, but also to the whole of the Commonwealth... My dear Papa was a very special person. It was signed off by aposThe Prince of Wales.apos In the picture, Anne can be seen standing by her father, with Prince Charles on her left side. Other images, taken with the rest of the family, including the Queen, also show Anne with heaps of blonde curls.  Yesterday, Anne paid tribute to her father, walking behind his coffin, alongside her brothers, as it made its way to St Georgeaposs Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle. After his death, she shared a touching tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, writing: You know itaposs going to happen but you are never really ready.

Pandemic restrictions meant Her Majesty was forced to sit alone at her beloved husbandaposs funeral at St Georgeaposs Chapel on Saturday afternoon. The Duke of Edinburghaposs coffin was draped in his personal standard, as well as a wreath of white spring flowers chosen by his we of  years. It also featured his Admiral of the Fleet naval cap and sword, along with the monarchaposs handwritten card in loving memory of the Duke, edged in black. Despite the pomp and ceremony, the service was a deeply personal one for the Queen and during the service she carried a number of special mementoes.The monarch was comforted by cherished belongings from her le with Prince Philip at the funeral including a photo of the couple when they were newlyweds and one of her husbandaposs pocket squares that she took in her handbag. During the service, which could only be attended by up to  mourners, the Queenaposs handwritten note reading in loving memory was left on top of the coffin. It was tucked in among the flowers, meaning whether the Queen signed it Elizabeth or her husbandaposs nickname for her aposLillibetapos was obscured. People Magazine, however, reports it was the latter, with the pet name originally given to her by her sister Princess Margaret and dad King George VI, as she couldnapost pronounce her own name as a child.  The Queen, dressed all in black, including a face mask, remained stoic as she was filmed first in the royal Bentley and then entering the chapel.Despite the highly emotional service, which also saw grandson Prince Harry reunited with his family after months in the US, HM remained dignied. She sat at the front of the chapel, with pallbearers placing the coffin in front of her pew, and bowed her head respectfully. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the Queenaposs note, and said it was private. Philipaposs coffin descended into the Royal Vault during his funeral service, lowered by an electric motor. It was a moment never seen before on television, with Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, describing it as unique in British royal history. Usually, the movement of the coffin into the vault beneath the floor of the Quire of St Georgeaposs Chapel would take place in private.

But while the ceremony was streamed to people across the globe, the monarch ensured it was still full of deeply personal touches which paid tribute to her late spouse.Itaposs believed the Queen carefully picked several tributes to honour her beloved who she was married to for  years.Itaposs thought she included poignant items hidden in her handbag, to keep the Duke close to her at all times. Due to the countryaposs ongoing Covid- pandemic and the restrictions that have been put in place by the government, Prince Philipaposs funeral was limited to just  guests. They had to all sit with their own households - socially distanced from other guests - in St Georgeaposs Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle. Images beamed around the world show the Queen sitting alone as she gazed upon her husbandaposs coffin, draped in his royal standard flag. But while millions watched, the Queen also added her own deeply personal touches too. A handwritten card Firstly, a handwritten card in loving memory of the Duke, edged in black, which was place on top of his coffin. Most of the note was obscured from the cameras and Buckingham Palace declined to comment on its private contents. But reports claimed the card was signed aposLilibetapos - a pet name shared between the Queen and the Duke. Floral tributes It was tucked in among the flowers, another tribute the Queen is said to have been personally involved in choosing. Her Majesty opted for white lilies and small white roses for the wreath, as well as white freesia, white wax flower, white sweet peas and jasmine.  An old photograph of the Queen and the Duke An insider claimed that the Queen also carried a photograph of the couple from their younger days in Malta, where they lived just after they were married. Sheaposs believed to have put this in her handbag. A handkerchief Also in her handbag was believed to be one of her husbandaposs handkerchiefs. The Duke was often seen with a white, folded square, inserted into the breast pocket of his suits, making it a fitting memory for the Queen to carry with her throughout the day.  The Queen watched the funeral from her usual seating position in St Georgeaposs Chapel. She placed her handbag on the empty seat next to her which would usually be occupied by the Duke of Edinburgh. A photo of Prince Philip raising his bowler hatIn a final tribute, itaposs believed the Queen picked one of her favourite photographs of Prince Philip - showing him walking away from the camera and raising his bowler hat - to be posted on the Royal Familyaposs official Instagram page and Twitter account.The caption simply read: In loving memory of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.  - .  Cameras gave the Queen a moment of privacy as her husbandaposs coffin was placed into the Royal Vault on Saturday. It was the first time such a moment has been televised. The Dukeaposs coffin was seen being lowered below the floor of the chapel, but the family were given the final moments to privately observe the very last view of his casket. The Queen remained stoic throughout the funeral, bowing her head for most of the ceremony. Her face was mostly obscured by her mask.

As a nation, we love few things more than ­getting together with friends and family, socialising, sharing stories and catching up. Coming at the end of a tough year with so few opportunities to do just that, the reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants – albeit only those with outdoor space – has been joyous and a real lt to the nation’s spirits. For people whose livelihoods rely on hospitality, this week will hopefully be remembered as the first baby step back to normality. There’s also been an overriding feeling of relief as peopleto venues in such encouraging numbers. Businesses have poured large chunks of cash into successfully and safely welcoming back guests to their beer ­gardens and terraces, come rain or shine – and in some cases, even snow. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section UKHospitality is the voice of the broad hospitality sector – Britain’s third largest sector, directly employing over three million people before the crisis hit – and understands how important a revival is for everyone. This dynamic industry and its venues can kick-start an economic recovery, restore and revive our high streets and communities. It can also generate jobs and careers for our young people, who have felt the brunt of the terrible economic impact of this pandemic. That is exactly why the Government cannot take its eye off the ball when it comes to supporting hospitality and ensuring we bounce back strongly. Issues like rent debt and the unfair burden of business rates still need to be resolved. Of course, support such as the furlough scheme has been incredibly helpful to sectors like hospitality and saved jobs – but the industry remains in a fragile state. Only four in  venues have the outdoor space to reopen, so many businesses are still shut and thousands of livelihoods still shrouded in uncertainty.

Sarahaposs Law was was rolled out across police forces in the two countries in April , allowing anyone to ask the police to check whether people who have contact with their child or children pose a risk. If the person has convictions for sexual offences against children or poses a risk of causing harm, the police can choose to disclose this information confidentially to the parent, carer or , ChronicleLive reports. Previously, a parent could raise concerns about someone, but there were no clear rules about whether or not they should be told anythingofficers discovered cause for concern. Police can also warn parentsconcerns are raised by grandparents or neighbours. How did Sarahaposs Law come to be  Sara Payne, the mum of Sarah Payne, who was murdered by a convicted sex offender, campaigned for the Government to bring in measures to protect children. Sarah, from Hersham, Surrey, was just eight-years-old when paedophile Roy Whiting abducted her while she was out playing with her siblings near her grandfatheraposs home in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex, on July , . She was grabbed as she walked back to the home along a country road after playing hide and seek in a cornfield. The search ended in heartbreak when the youngsteraposs body was found  days later in a field near Pulborough, about  miles away from where she was last seen.  Grief-stricken Ms Payne became a leading advocate for child protection and worked endlessly to campaign for and bring in Sarahaposs Law, formally known as the Child Sex Offenders Disclosure Scheme. She was awarded an MBE by the Queen for her victim advocacy and child protection work. She wrote a book, called A Motheraposs Story, about her le and her daughteraposs death, and co-founded Phoenix Chief Advocates to help those victimised by paedophile crimes, challenge the institutional anti-victim prejudice, and help people with PTSD. Sarahaposs father Michael, , died of natural causes at his home in Maidstone, Kent, in October .  Whiting, now , lived in a seafront flat in Littlehampton, about five miles from the lane where he kidnapped Sarah. He had previously abducted and sexually assaulted an eight-year-old girl, serving four years in prison. He became a suspect early in the investigation and in February  was charged with kidnapping and murdering the schoolgirl. Whiting was convicted in December  by a jury at Lewes Crown Court, and sentenced to le in prison with a minimum term of  years. He will be  when he is eligible for parole. Who goes on the Sex Offenders’ Register  Itaposs important to note that a sex offender and a paedophile arenapost necessarily the same thing.

Here we examine the signicance of some of the finer details from Saturday’s occasion... The cars Prince Charles arrived in a Rolls-Royce Phantom VI. The ,cc all-alloy engine limousine was first manufactured in . It has leather upholstery and a cocktail cabinet has often been incorporated into the rear compartment’s cabinetwork. Prince William arrived in a Rolls-Royce Phantom V. This model was first produced in  and another famous owner was John Lennon. The Queen arrived in a State Bentley, which does not have number-plates as part of the ‘Royal prerogative’ – powers and rights the sovereign alone possesses. Her Majesty is the only person in the UK not required to have a plate.  Bentley made the car for the Queen to mark her Golden Jubilee – celebrating  years on the throne – in . There are actually two of the cars, both kept in the Royal Mews near Buckingham Palace. The cars are used mostly on official engagements, and are always escorted by marked and unmarked Royal Protection Squad vehicles, local police vehicles and motorcycle outriders. The readings As well as words from the Book of Common Prayer, the service also included nods to the Roman Catholic Church and to the Orthodox tradition of the Duke’s childhood. Four voices intoned words from the Kontakion – the Orthodox churches’ prayers for the dead. They were a link not only to the Orthodox faith into which the Prince was baptised, but also to royal relatives murdered during the Russian revolution, to his mother and to the funeral of Princess Diana in . The nine lines of the Kontakion were sung as an anthem to the Kiev Melody, arranged by Sir Walter Parratt. Do you enjoy reading about the royal family  for all the best royal news from the Mirror hereThey would have been prayers well known to Prince Philip ’s mother, Princess Alice, who later became a Greek Orthodox nun and to his great-aunt, Grand Duchess Elizabeth, murdered by the Bolsheviks in  and later canonised by the Russian Orthodox Church.The last lines – “weeping o’er the grave, we make our song” – formed part of a piece sung as Di’s coffin left Westminster Abbey. The jewellery and his medals  The Duchess of Cambridge chose a pearl necklace that paid tribute to both the Queen and the late Princess Diana. Featuring four strands of pearls and a diamond clasp, the Japanese Pearl Choker was also worn by the Duchess for the Queen and Prince Philip’s th wedding anniversary dinner in . It was previously loaned to Diana by the Queen in  for a banquet in honour of Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus of the Netherlands at Hampton Court Palace during their state visit. The Queen wore the piece to a Royal engagement in Bangladesh in  where she paired it with the Girls of Great Britain Tiara, and to a dinner in London in  to mark the th birthday of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. All of the Queen’s children and the Duke of Cambridge wore the Garter Star, representing the Order of the Garter, which is the highest order of chivalry in the British honours system and appointments are made at the sovereign’s sole discretion. The carriage and his gloves  Made of aluminium and steel, the carriage was built to the duke’s specications eight years ago, drawing on his knowledge of the rules set by the Federation Equestre Internationale . The carriage can seat four people at maximum capacity and can harness up to eight horses. It has two padded black leather seats and a clock mounted on brass at the front, which features an inscription commemorating the gt of the timepiece. The clock was presented to Philip by the Queen’s Royal Irish Hussars on October , , to mark his  years as their Colonel-in-Chief. Prince Philip had been designing driving carriages since the s - after taking up the sport aged . The Duke was forced to give up polo in  due what he called his ‘dodgy’ arthritic wrist, and decided to find a new sport to concentrate on. I suppose I could have left it at that, but I have never felt comfortable as a spectator, he admitted. Tennis, golf and squash were no good for his wrist and sailing would have taken him away from home at weekends. It then suddenly occurred to me that this carriage-driving might be just the sport, Philip said. Prince Philip loved nothing more than to go haring through the countryside at high speed, whip in hand, in a horse-drawn wheeled carriage. I am getting old, my reactions are getting slower, and my memory is unreliable, but I have never lost the sheer pleasure of driving a team through the British countryside, he explained in the book he wrote about the sport. Even when he was an octogenarian he continued to compete in demanding carriage-driving competitions. The duke, as president of the IEF, had initiated drafting the first international rules for carriage-driving in , which sparked an interest in the sport. By far his most famous convert was Penelope ‘Penny’ Knatchbull, previously known as Lady Romsey now the Countess of Mountbatten of Burma, whom he coached. He and Penny were often pictured together at the Royal Windsor Horse Show, sometimes riding mini motorcycles around the carriage driving course. The -year-old countess - who was one of the duke’s closest friends - has been given the honour of being one of the  guests at his funeral on Saturday. Prince Philip also taught his daughter-in-law, the Countess of Wessex, while granddaughter Lady Louise Windsor, , has also taken up the sport. Land Rover drivers  The servicemen in charge of the specially modied Land Rover transporting the body of the Duke of Edinburgh spent the past week ensuring they could drive “at the correct speed”. Corporal Louis Murray was at the wheel, with Corporal Craig French, as Land Rover commander for the Royal hearse, alongside him.The two -year-old staff instructors from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers were picked “on a coin toss” from a group of four who had been training for the purpose – and the duo were described by officials as a “trusted pairof hands”. Cpl French stated it was his job to “ensure that the driver puts the vehicle in the right place atthe right time and whether to speed up or slow down”.Beforehand he said: “We have done a lot of practice and you get to feel what the correct speed is. It’s now like second nature.” Military pallbearers  The son of a Falklands war hero accompanied the Duke of Edinburgh on his final journey. Major General Rupert Jones, Colonel Commandant of The Rles, was among eight pallbearers from the army, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy, with whom the Duke served with distinction during the Second World War. Jones, , is the youngest son of Lieutenant Colonel Herbert ‘H’ Jones, the paratrooper who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross by the Queen for his “devastating display of courage” at the Battle of Goose Green in .Rupert, who joined the army in , became the youngest officer to be appointed a major general in , and Prince Philip was colonel-in-chief of his regiment.Lieutenant General Roland Walker, of the Grenadier Guards, and Major General Matthew Holmes, of the Royal Marines, were also among the pallbearers. Royal burial vault  Measuring ft long and ft wide, the Royal Vault is  metres below ground and is accessed via an electric lt and a series of pulleys. The burial chamber has space for  royals along its two sides and  in the centre. Located beneath St George’s Chapel in the Windsor Castle grounds, it was built in  on the orders of King George III, the first monarch it would hold, upon his death  years later.

I had wanted to transform the garden just before lockdown but was shocked when quotes came back in the region of £,. It was way out of our budget, but we were desperate to do something as the garden was a complete mess. The decking was crumbling and the fences were broken and had been put up against old ones.What do you think  Share your views in the comments below...It was a completely botched job. We ripped out everything and started from scratch. My partner watched YouTube videos on how to build decking and put up fences, and then we set to work. It wasn’t easy because we were homeschooling our -year-old daughter Isobel at the same time. We pulled up the decking and three fences, lted up all the broken flagstones, dug out old tree stumps, removed a shed and even levelled the garden that seemed like it had four dferent tiers.

Doors not accessible to the public, structures like lighting rigs, and even entire buildings are covered in a paint colour Disney developed itself, which it calls aposGo Away Greenapos. Working on the same logic as camouflage, the muted shade of green aims to draw as little attention as possible, encouraging visitors to look past it and focus on the things Disney wants you to see instead.It was discussed by the hosts of the Leaposs A Party podcast in a clip shared to TikTok, as Ryan Smith said: I saw where they paint doors a certain shade of green. Apparently us humans, we donapost recognise that shade of green and we donapost even recognise the door being there.Fellow host Paul McGroarty then says: So thataposs called Go Away Green. Go Away Green is a paint colour that Disney uses when they want to hide things.  Fans have also said there is a second paint colour named aposNo See Um Greyapos used for the same purpose. The short clip racked up a staggering . million views and more than , comments as one person added: Itaposs just a colour your eyes gloss over so itaposs not like we canapost perceive it, itaposs just to hide back stage stuff from your attention.

The scene has haunted him day and night for the past  years. “The image is stuck in my head and I can’t get over it,” he says, taking a drag of his cigarette. “The child was only . He was kidnapped because his father was a ‘pentito’ – a police informant. “I went with colleagues when we found he’d been kept in a cave. There was no body to see. It had been completely dissolved in acid. “All that remained was his bed, burned from the chemicals, where he’d been sleeping.” What do you think  Have your say in comments below Very little  makes Alfonso flinch these days. From  to , the magistrate was one of the elite members of Italy’s anti-Mafia unit. Often spending years gathering evidence from informers and wire-taps, it was responsible for the successful conviction of some of organised crime’s most bloodthirsty ringleaders. Now, Alfonso’s book about his work is the inspiration behind hard-hitting Channel  drama The Hunter, starring Italian actors Francesco Montanari and Miriam Dalmazio. Telling the story of fictional magistrate Saverio Barone’s ruthless fight against the Mafia, there is more than a hint of Reservoir Dogs about the series. An eye-watering torture scene is not for the faint-hearted. In an exclusive interview with the Sunday People, Alfonso, , tells how crime bosses plotted to blow him up – once with a melon packed with explosives, then later with a missile. Pouring himself a drink in his Naples kitchenette, he explains how living under -hour protection and constantly moving to stay alive was too big a strain for his marriage. And, as the biggest mob trial in three decades continues in southern Italy, he insists it is now down to the next generation to continue his fight. Alfonso came to prominence while working at the public prosecutor’s office in Palermo, in the north of Sicily – a traditional Mafia stronghold. He was audacious and hungry for promotion. “I’d compiled evidence that my boss in the prosecutor’s office was colluding with the Mafia,” he explains. “I’ve been told that was a brave thing to do.  “People knew, it’s just that no one had spoken out about it before. “I was brought up on bread and justice, as we say in Italian. I came from a family of lawyers – including my mum, Giuseppina, which wasn’t common work for a woman at that time. “Even my sister Marzia ended up working in anti-Mafia. “I didn’t question the decision to take the job and my parents gave me enormous support.” In the early Nineties, Alfonso had his work cut out. The north of Sicily was controlled by Mafia, often referred to on the island simply as Cosa Nostra – “our thing”. Alfonso recalls: “You couldn’t do anything, even opening a shop, without paying money to Mafia. “There was no escaping them. They led the traffic of drugs and were money rich. “In the Nineties there was a very deliberate campaign to kill going on. It was a declaration of war, to show the state that the Mafia held the power.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  In , less than a year before Alfonso joined the anti-Mafia unit, the bloodshed was even worse than usual. Two of the highest profile anti-Mafia magistrates were assassinated. First was judge Giovanni Falcone, driving home from the airport – kg of explosives were detonated in a drain running under the motorway. The blast killed him, his we and three members of his police escort. Less than eight weeks later judge Paolo Borsellino and five members of his escort died in a car bomb near his mother’s Palermo apartment building. Mafia bosses from the Sicilian town of Corleone toasted the murders with champagne. Within days the government dispatched , military personnel to contain the threat.  Bombs went off everywhere – not just on the streets, but in places that held great importance to Italians, such as the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Alfonso reveals: “On one occasion we stopped kg of explosives being detonated at the Tower Of Pisa.” But his new world brought with it a huge loss of freedom. He was ­under -hour security, and always flanked by bodyguards. Never in the same place for long, he lived a restless le, shunted from one hideout to the next. Wire-taps revealed the Mafia were closing in on him. He says: “In one recording of a phone call between two mafiosi, there was a clear reference made to me. “They spoke about a red melon, with explosives and a timer. It was payback because I’d just given the son of a Mafia boss a le sentence.  “Another time, I found out that a missile launcher was intended for me. “I didn’t worry for my le but I did for my we’s at the time. It was too risky. She moved with our daughter to Milan. It was so dficult for them, we eventually separated. “At one point I had to hide in a castle in the mountains.” He sent some of the Sicilian Mafia’s most dangerous and cruel bosses to jail. Among them was Leoluca Bagarella – called “il capo dei capi” . Bagarella ran the Corleonesi Mafia clan, a Sicilian faction which had murdered hundreds of people. Modelling himself on The God­father, he had music from the Marlon Brando movie played at his wedding. There was also Giovanni Brusca, known in Mafia circles as The Swine.  Alfonso said: “I took a list of all the people who had died for the Mafia since Brusca was . We started scrolling through the names and he’d say, ‘This one, yes, this one, no’. “In total there were about  who he’d murdered.” There were also those who had died in massacres he had helped plot. At his  trial Brusca admitted detonating the bomb that killed Falcone. Somehow Alfonso has managed to stay alive and now works at the Court of Naples – fighting the region’s Mafia-like Camorra. He is father to a five-month-old daughter and his partner Diana is also a magistrate. But while bodies may no longer line the streets, the Mafia are still very much present In January,  people went on trial in the region of Calabria, in boot-shaped Italy’s southern toe. It has been the biggest and most important organised crime trial in more than  years.

I felt I was playing pretty well,” he said.“But we changed the middle and obviously we got some wins so that was good.“To be fair, the manager spoke to me every week saying I hadn’t done anything wrong but we were picking up results.“He was happy with my attitude and the way I applied myself, I never chucked the toys out of the pram or anything.“I came in against St Johnstone and felt I’d done pretty well so it was hard to be back out of the team after.“Then Maxy and Gowser both score at Ayr on the Tuesday so it was a genius decision from the gaffer!“It’s been frustrating because I feel I’ve been playing really well this year.“But I’m here to help the team.”Dundee boss James McPake certainly isn’t short of quality central midfield options – club captain and talisman Charlie Adam has also been on the bench next to Byrne of late.McGowan and Anderson have been the choice lately and both have been picking up key goals and laying on assists for team-mates in vital victories.Add to that theof Jordan McGhee, the defender who has been a revelation when moved into the middle of the park this season.With only two starting berths to fight for in the system that has seen the Dark Blues pick up  points in their last five matches, competition is fierce.“Jordan has been out for a while so it is testament to him for coming in and playing so well,” Byrne added.“The competition in the middle of the park is really tough, to be honest.#We have a lot of really good players there – Charlie Adam, Gowser, Max, Jordan and young Fin Robertson when he comes back.“It is strong competition so you do need to be on it.I think that’s what has pushed everybody on. You can see the standard in training has pushed up a notch with boys coming back.“I maybe did dip after the Hearts game so maybe that’s why I came out but hopefully now I can pick up the form and stay in the team.“I think everybody will have a part to play before now and the end of the season.“It has been frustrating, I won’t lie.#But I’ve kept my head down and worked really hard.#Hopefully, I can have a good end to the season.” ANALYSIS: James McPake looks to have solved Dundee midfield riddle # but insists Charlie Adam still has huge part to play\" title\"#ANALYSIS: James McPake looks to have solved Dundee midfield riddle # but insists Charlie Adam still has huge part to play# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp james-mcpake-looks-to-have-solved-dundee-midfield-riddle-but-insists-charlie-adam-still-has-huge-part-to-play embed # secretyTZxQLFb\" data-secret\"yTZxQLFb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"paddlers-ferries-bun-boat---hurricane-hutchs-moving-memories-clydes-top-ships","story":"WHEN Robin lsquoHurricane Hutchrsquo Hutchison first started work on the Clyde, the river was in its heyday."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-happened-city-tried-lead-way-housing","story":"IN , housing in Glasgow changed forever."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-dior-models-rock-runway-1955","story":"RENFREW Airport had never looked quite so stylishhellip"},{"url":null,"title":"susan-baird-glasgow-lord-provost-never-forgot-east-end-roots","story":" GLASGOWrsquoS longest serving councillor of modern times and the cityrsquos second female Lord Provost was a bold and bright breath of fresh air in local politics.

logging specialist READ Cased Hole has confirmed the demerger of its ANSA data analytics business.This has resulted in the formation of a new, fully independent, and separately run company trading as “ANSA”.ANSA # a global team of independent log analysis experts # delivers services for well integrity, production logging and reservoir evaluation within the oilfield sector, from its data hubs in Aberdeen, Houston and Doha.ANSA is now expanding its portfolio with the development of advanced software-based data analysis solutions applicable for a broader range of energy projects.As a result of the demerger, READ and ANSA now operate as two discrete business entities, each with its own organisational structure, resources, financing, and leadership.READ will continue to provide downhole technologies and services for cased hole logging to the global oil and gas market.The new independent ANSA business will deliver a comprehensive suite of data processing, analysis, and interpretation solutions to help clients overcome energy-related challenges around the world. However, ANSA#s services will not be limited to the oil and gas market.Both ANSA and READ are majority-owned by Norwegian private equity firm Norvestor.Tor Erling Gunnerød, Norvestor Equity Partner and chairman of READ said: “As a fully independent company, ANSA has the freedom to be more entrepreneurial and focus on its core competency of delivering ironclad data analysis solutions to clients around the world.“Our strategic goal is for ANSA to further develop its range of specialist services, accelerate the expansion of its client base, and create increased value andon investment for its shareholders.”Bruce Melvin will continue in the role of CEO of both READ and ANSA in the interim until a new figurehead for each business has been put in place.Bruce said: “This is a transformational moment for both companies.#Each has a tremendous opportunity to streamline its operations and ultimately focus on what it does best.#Clearly, change of this magnitude brings challenges, given the interconnectedness of the two business lines over the last  years.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day.

And Maddy Silcock has been in the top- four times between  and .#At least one of them has achieved a top-three ranking in every year since .#Christie was the trailblazer for the others, winning the m and m sprint double at the  Scottish championships, then repeating that feat in .Her  triumph, at the age of , made her the first junior age group athlete to achieve the double since Linsey Macdonald in .Then Alisha Rees stepped forward to win the m title four years on the spin from  to . Her first victory came just four months after celebrating her th birthday.Silcock is the youngest of the trio and she represented Scotland in the m at the  Commonwealth Youth Games, reaching the semi-final.Russell added: #Kathryn, Alisha and Maddy all joined the Banchory section of the club as youngsters. Kathryn and Alisha were eight or nine when they first came along, while Maddy was .#They became seniors in ,  and  respectively, but all three gained their first Scotland senior vests while still in the junior age group.#In , Alisha set the current Scottish women#s m record indoors at .secs. She is also the second fastest over m in . and, in , she was the th-placed Scottish woman, for all events, in the world athletics rankings, scoring  points.#Rees is now in her final year at Loughborough University and is an established Great Britain international.She is on the fringes of the Olympic selection, her best chance perhaps coming in the xm relay.Christie and Silcock have both suffered from foot injuries which have hindered their development in recent years, but both hope toto action before too long.Russell points out that there are many more talented young athletes coming from this area including Lisa Herrington, Louisa Rowse, Lindsey Young and Craig Strachan among others.He may hint that there#s some mysterious force at play, generating such a conveyor belt of talent within the small part of the north-east, but in truth there#s a simple explanation.It#s all down to the hard work, skill, enthusiasm and encouragement provided by the likes of Russell and his coaching colleagues at Banchory Stonehaven AC over many years.Russell, who celebrated his th birthday recently, was recognised for his contribution to the sport when he was awarded a British Empire Medal in the  New Year#s Honours List.North-east athletes looking for a higher level of competition are being invited to join the Jaguars Track and Field Club.The Jaguars, constituted in , is the only Scottish club competing in the National Athletics League, which was formed following the disbandment of the British Athletics League and the UK Women’s Athletic League.Membership is open to all senior and U athletes, who currently have a Scottish first claim club and feel they would benefit from this pathway.For more details contact Mark Stringer by email at Jaguarstandf.membership@gmailThe National Athletics League has put in place a revised fixture list for .Dates and venues: June – Manchester Regional Athletics Arena July  – Manchester Regional Athletics Arena August  – Robin Park Athletics Stadium, Wigan August  – Wavertree Stadium, Liverpool.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well. It’s a tough plant though and once established only requires regular pruning after flowering has finished in the autumn.April not only sees the start of National Gardening Week , but it really kicks off the gardening season.Top April tips from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"ian pops up with new ball","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likelythat you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protectionit is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Can I still infect other people Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect othersthan people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their ownthey need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.Can I stop wearing a facemask when Irsquom vaccinated No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optionalin more places.Will immunity last We are optimisticthat immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twisthere, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellipWill I need a booster ... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one is immunity doesnrsquot last long enoughwithout a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one is the virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.Will everything go back to normal once everyone has had both doses The gradual easing of restrictionsthat have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travelmight need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-tests-people-without-symptoms","story":"CORONAVIRUS tests for people without symptoms are being offered in Peeblesshire again from today.In a press release issued by NHS Borders last week, the health board outlined plans for rapid testing sites toacross the region.Tests will be offered in West Lintontodayand tomorrow.COVIDtesting will alsoin Peeblesand Innerleithenover the weekend.:Fire started deliberately in Peeblesshire, suspect police ndash appeal issuedTesting will take place at the fire stations of all the above locations between .am-pm.NHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoCommunity testing of those who feel well and do not have any typical COVID- symptoms is one of the key ways that we can keep each other safe.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le.

We will explore the idea of whether, in fact, less is more.We are looking for people of all ages to apply families, couples, single people # to take time out from their normal le and step into a dferent way of living.If any of your readers are interested in finding out more, they should email simplele@fivemilefilms, telling us briefly why you would like to live a simpler le.Since the UK was first officially plunged into lockdown, we have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust like everyone  to the daily challenges this has created.

But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .

Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These devices have blocked an estimated , calls, of which , will have been scam phone calls prevented at least  scams and saved vulnerable households an estimated £, in NHS and health and social care costs.PC Laura Evans of Argyll and Dunbartonshire Policing Division said: #The most common types of scams at the moment are telephone and internet scams whereby the caller or person emailing, pretends to be someone , for example, someone from your bank, BT, Amazon or Sky.#We have a large number of telephone frauds where the caller is told their bank has set up a new account for them and has asked them to transfer their money to this new account. Your bank will never ask you to do this and I would encourage people to simply hang up the telephoneyou think you are being scammed or,you are concerned about someone  receiving scam calls, then consider a call-blocker device.#The most common calls being blocked by trueCall units are misleading sales of insurance for white goods, appliances or Sky equipment and attempts to sell cover for domestic home repairs.As more people signed up to streaming services during lockdown, there was an increase in scam calls purportedly from Amazon Prime, where cold callers said that the recipient#s subscription was due for renewal or that their account had been hacked.Another type of nuisance call which emerged towards the end of  was the sale of timeshares, possibly in response to widespread issues with travel and accommodation during the pandemic.An Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: #Scammers are unscrupulous with the sole intention of identying and exploiting the most vulnerable in our communities by obtaining people#s personal data and to encourage them to give the caller their bank details. This is often achieved by implying that urgent action is required – a tactic which particularly targets elderly and more vulnerable people.#The trueCall call-blocking unit can give our residents peace of mind, knowing thatthe phone rings it will be someone they want to talk to.#If you are being pestered by nuisance calls or you know a family member or friend that could benefit from having a call-blocker, please contact Argyll and Bute Trading Standards on    or tradingstandards.office@argyll-bute.gov.uk to apply for a free device.#"},{"url":null,"title":"announcements april 16 2021","story":"ProductionUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The support we#ve received from the community, and local and national businesses, has been amazing.#Emma added: #We wanted to support the project because we know the dference it will make to the community. It#s fantastic — although we hope we never have to use it.#The helipad project was led by ambulance technician Stuart McLellan, from Neilston in East Renfrewshire, after he saw emergency services struggling to airlt patients from the often water-logged field which previously served as a helipad while visiting relatives in Campbeltown in .The £, facility was fully funded by the HELP Appeal, a charity dedicated to funding NHS hospital helipads, and was built by Kintyre companies McFadyens Contractors and McKinven and Colville, with specialist equipment supplied by FEC Heliports Equipment."},{"url":null,"title":"lindsay gets active ahead of 50k walk in memory of dad","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There was mention the flat had not been used much for the purpose of respite for islanders.However, a report before IJB members said the lack of consultation over it closing had caused community concern. The meeting was told there had been #a mix up# over communicating what was happening with islanders.Councillor Mulvaney said he did not feel the flat merited still being in the budget. #We should have saved this [the money] a number of years ago,# he said.Councillor Currie said: #The flat has been used, not much, but it has been used. Everyone is accepting it could have been advertised better.#It was Mid Argyll councillor Sandy Taylor who asked for the service level agreement for the advocacy service to be spared from the savings option list as #a contribution to mental health.#MID ARGYLL AND ISLAY:People across Mid Argyll and Islay have had their mental health boosted thanks to the innovative #Take  Challenge# which began in Kintyre.Inspired by Campbeltown Tesco manager David Brown#s personal K-a-day challenge in , mental health network ACUMEN, in conjunction with Kintyre Link Club, organised the initiative encouraging more people to #take five# each day –  five minutes of walking, five deep breaths of fresh air or a five-kilometre walk or run – with the aim of boosting wellbeing.After success in Kintyre, ACUMEN mental health development worker Sarah McFadzean rolled the challenge out across Mid Argyll and Islay, where people are encouraged to support one another in their challenges by way of a dedicated Facebook group.Where possible, people have been able to meet in twos and, as restrictions change, it is hoped opportunities for groups to Take  together will increase as the initiative moves to the Oban, Lorn and the Isles area in June.Sarah said: #Being involved and enjoying the challenge is as important as the activities themselves.#I would like to thank everyone who supported and got involved in Take  for their enthusiasm and assistance.#We are in the process of developing a Mental Health Forum and Lived Experience Group in the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Isles, the purpose of which will be to gather thoughts on current service provision, listen to others# experiences and inform future planning, along with providing information from a range of services and peer support.#For more information contact sarah.mcfadzean@acumennetwork"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Meantime, however, with the exception of the magazine, all society activities remain in a state of suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone. There are plenty online groups and pages offering guidance and support. DogLost is an excellent charity which provides a free lost and found service.You should also noty police, dog wardens, vets and local rescue centres.Tables for Dementia UK#s annual cake and tea event, Time for a Cuppa, have been reset.Dementia UK is the only charity dedicated to supporting the whole family through dementia specialist Admiral Nurses.The charity#s annual fundraising event takes place between May  and May .Since its launch, it has raised more than £ million with the support of fundraisers, Dementia UK staff and celebrities.One of the highlights of last year#s event was celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and who are giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way of course – in what will be a special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host your own tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We have staff, more volunteers, moved to larger premises and do much more than shopping.April is our birthday month where we celebrate on the th and th, when we became a company and a charity respectively.

We have celebrated birthdays, weddings, Christmases, Easters and any day we can! There has been laughter and sadness, fun, hope and joy.It was  when the seeds were planted at the South Kintyre Fit Communities about the need to develop a shopping service to help older people on discharge from hospital, no longer able to drive or to carry heavy bags.Since then, we have provided not just a shopping service but a number of social activities and housekeeping throughout Kintyre. We have developed the #Making Kintyre Dementia Friendly# project to help all parts of the community to have an understanding of dementia and how it can be managed. We have worked with children of all ages, meeting and helping the older generation and look forward to doing so again.Covid- has changed all our lives and we have had to adapt to dferent ways of keeping in touch and keeping busy. Phone Buddies was set up and we had a monthly virtual tea.However, our plans – started last year – to celebrate our th anniversary with parties has had to be cancelled but we are marking the occasion with a specially made mug by Simon Rochford of Campbeltown Pottery.Thanks to everyone who has been involved in any way with Shopper-Aide – it has been and, I hope, will continue to be, a help to the older generations in Kintyre.So here is to the next  years."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In our desire to understand it, we have created starry patterns in our minds like the Plough, the Bull and so on, however, the signs of the Zodiac were already known to the Babylonians in  BC so that is not something new.Today, constellations like Aries, Gemini and others continue to fascinate followers of both astronomy and astrology.One of the most interesting star formations is the Pleiades, better known as the Seven Sisters. Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time. These books contain fascinating stories, many with moral teaching in them to guide us along the way of le.Alas, although the bible has sold millions of copies down the ages, it often remains unread and not consulted.Just as binoculars can enrich our vision of the #starry, starry night# so we can enrich our lives by a careful exploration of the bible and discover what it can teach us, so, let#s look at it more closely and take time to enjoy what it has to offer."},{"url":null,"title":"former-ross-high-pupil-ruari-paton-aiming-scottish-cup-glory","story":"Ruari Paton will be hoping to line up for Stranraer todaywhen they make the long journey north to face Brora Rangers, who stunned Hearts in the previous round.The frontman attended the Tranent secondary school after signing for Hibernian as a teenager and making the move from Dublin.Many had expected Stranraer to be travelling to Tynecastle this weekend but Brora caused one of the biggest shocks in the competitionrsquos history when they won - last Tuesday.Paton was part of the Stranraer team taking on Brechin City at the same time and said that his reaction was much the same as football fans up and down the country when he heard the result.He said: ldquoI would not like to take anything away from Brora but you donrsquot really hear of a Championship team getting beaten by a Highland League or a Lowland League team ever.ldquoIt was a shock, it was a big shock, but fair play to them.ldquoWhat an achievement it is and it is an amazing challenge to overcome.ldquoYou cannot take anything away from them.Stranraer have enjoyed an impressive start to the campaign, with just one defeat since the beginning of November, as they look toto League One.Paton, who now lives in Bothwell, South Lanarkshire, has been at the heart of that form, scoring eight goals in all competitions, with strikes against Spartans and a last-minute penalty winner against Kelty Hearts in the previous round.He has also found the net for Gala Fairydean Rovers, while on loan from Hibs, and for East Kilbride in the competition last year.Now, attention has turned to the trip to Brora and Paton said: ldquoTherersquos nothing better in the world than scoring.

Both of them made it very easy in terms of putting you at ease.ldquoHe was particularly interested in the history, not just of the racecourse, but also of the golf course. I think he had anticipated coming for just a race day, but we had gathered a lot of historical information about the racecourse and the golf course and he was very interested in both.ldquoThe impression I got was that he was a keen sportsman, but perhaps racing was not his first love, it was The Queenrsquos, and he was more interested in talking to people.ldquoHe did enjoy it ndash The Queen had a runner, and I got a bit carried away when we thought her horse was going to win.

Liberal Democrats have been highlighting the shocking state of mental health services across Scotland.Right now, adults can wait up to two years for necessary treatments.Even prior to the pandemic, waiting times for these vital community services were getting worse.Earlier this year, Lib Dems in the Scottish Parliament finally persuaded the Scottish Government to declare this awful situation a national crisis.Now we need to elect more MSPs that will treat it as that.We immediately need to see a resumption of mental health First Aid training.This was suspended for the pandemic, yet physical First Aid courses were allowed to continue.During the recent budget negotiations, my party was able to secure pound million for community services and we need to see much more going towards these early help services.The impact on our families, communities and economy of failing to take this crisis seriously cannot be overstated.Under the current SNP Government, it is not just mental health services which have suffered.Nicola Sturgeon has broken her waiting times guarantee, failing , patients, meaning they have to wait longer than  weeks for vital services.The mismanagement of hospital construction has meant that the new Sick Kids building in Edinburgh has opened  years after it was promised.Now she is threatening closure of the vital Eye Pavilion, which has provided such fantastic treatment for so many across the Lothians.It appears that her Government wishes to move the service to St Johnrsquos in Livingston, making it extremely dficult for many communities across East Lothian.In a few weeksrsquo time, we need to elect someone who will fight tooth and nail for investment in our health services and push to keep them as local as possible.This wonrsquot be possiblewe

as postal ballots arrive this week, it is time for East Lothianrsquos candidates to outline how they plan to make a dference for our communities.My campaign is focusing on our recovery from Covid-.I am presenting positive commitments to our towns and villages while, at the same time, warning of the risks of breaking up the United Kingdom.One of my top campaign priorities is education and this reflects local peoplersquos priorities too.We must do more to support our young people who have been devastated by the effects of Covid-.In East Lothian, the pupil-to-teacher ratio ranks alongside Edinburgh as the worst in Scotland.The SNP have failed to deliver on their promise of reducing class sizes and pupils are suffering restricted subject choice.Thatrsquos why the Scottish Conservatives are committed to delivering , extra teachers nationally.The SNP have made only limited progress in closing the attainment gap in our schools ndash despite saying it was their defining mission.Alongside the local Labour council administration, the SNP are failing pupils from the poorest backgrounds in East Lothian.Our countyrsquos attainment gap grew by three per cent between  and .It is unacceptable that the SNP Government have excluded local schools from receiving attainment challenge funding to address this.If elected as your MSP, I will press the case for more investment and more teachers for our schools, to help give all our young people the very best start in le.Only a vote for me in the constituency vote, and only by casting your hugely important lsquoparty

where across Scotland The SNP is committed to public services: wersquoll give NHS staff a four per cent pay rise and introduce both a National Care Service and a National Wage for Carers.Nicola Sturgeon recently set out her aims to ldquobring on stream underused theatre capacity in community and general hospitals to treat more patients as day cases... including in East Lothian Community Hospital in Haddington.That is an immediate benefit, on our doorstep.Wersquore helping children to learn by ensuring they donrsquot go hungry at school and investing in social housing and fair rents in the private sector.Meeting housing needs must be guided by principles of social justice, equality and human rights: everyone is entitled to a home that supports health, wellbeing, job prospects and le chances.The SNPrsquos lsquoHousing to rsquo plan was initiated before the pandemic.Having consulted widely across Scotland, it is delivering a housing strategy putting people and communities first, with , affordable homes by  , including  per cent for social housing.The construction industry can benefit the economy and good-quality housing can transform lives.I believe voters trust the SNP to build the post-Covid recovery of public services.They have already rejected Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit shambles and its  promise to spend billions more on the NHS.I believe East Lothian voters will similarly reject the Labour and Tory recent support of stockpiling even more nuclear weapons, rather than spending those billions on health, housing and education.Broken promises undermine public trust, and trust is fundamental in this election.Which leader do you trust to form a government that represents your values and prioritises public services meeting your communityrsquos needs Rebuilding an economy supporting public services will make Scotland the country we know it can be it needs the full powers of independence and I trust Nicola Sturgeonrsquos experienced leadership.To

a mark of respect for HM The Queen and the Royal Family.Prince Philip was a remarkable public servant and we will again suspend campaigning on Saturday for his funeral to reflect on his contribution to public le.Before campaigning was suspended, Scottish Labour unveiled its recovery plan for the economy and jobs.At its heart is a pound. billion jobs recovery plan, the biggest job creation scheme in the history of devolution.This recognises the scale of the looming jobs crisis the country faces.It includes guaranteeing a job or training for every under-, as well as those over- who are long-term unemployed, , new apprenticeships and a skills revolution.The party also launched plans for an ambitious climate recovery, something Scottish Labour believes should go hand in hand with our economic recovery.This includes investing in green transport, safer walking and cycling routes, free bus travel for under-s, making all homes energy efficient to reduce living costs, create jobs and help to reduce our carbon emissions.These innovative national plans will translate well to a local level, providing a framework to support East Lothianrsquos recovery.However, Irsquom very clear that our local recovery, while backed by national guidance and funding, must be designed and delivered locally, not by ministers and civil servants in Edinburgh.Over the last year, our communities have demonstrated how they can come together in times of need and look after each other.Local communities, businesses and organisations should be empowered to show the same drive and determination in recovering from Covid- that they have shown throughout the crisis.Finally, on a more personal note, I have pledged my support for several important campaigns and initiatives so far during the campaign.Among them are the Teach the Future pledge on making the climate emergency part of the curriculum the More for Scotlandrsquos Animals pledge on animal welfare the Walk, Wheel, Cycle, Vote

candidates the chance to speak about what theyve been up to and why you should vote for them.Colin Beattie WE ALL have a huge respect and affection for our NHS.Throughout the Covid- pandemic, our NHS has been there for us ndash sometimes at great personal cost.I believe that offering our NHS staff an inflation-busting four per cent pay rise is well deserved, although I wish it could be more.South of the Border, one per cent is being imposed.This is simply an insult.There is a perception that our NHS is lsquobrokenrsquo in some way.I do not believe this, but I do see a huge organisation which now needs to re-invent itself, not for the first time, into an efficient, modern support for us all.However, our NHS is genuinely under threat.Privatisation is not just a scare word.The Transatlantic Trade Deal being negotiated with the USA leaves our NHS vulnerable and available for sale.Our SNP MPs proposed an amendment which would have ensured that our NHS remained in the public ownership.The Westminster Government rejected that safeguard.Since GP surgeries are independent contractors, not run by the NHS, they are vulnerable to being sold to the highest bidder.This is how the system was set up in .It may have made sense at the time but no longer.We must review the deal with doctors and ensure that creeping privatisation cannot take place.In Scotland, we have control over our NHS.However, the UK Government passed the Internal Markets Act, which allows UK Government ministers to arbitrarily enforce a lsquolevelling outrsquo of regulations and dferences between the nations of the UK.This would allow London to make NHS Scotland available for sale regardless of our wishes.I will fight to prevent the loss of our NHS and the best way to be sure of that is to take back control of our own affairs.Please give me an opportunity on May  to continue to serve our community and to protect our NHS.Stevie Curran IrsquoD LIKE to begin by expressing my sadness at the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh ndash a dedicated public servant.I send my condolences to Her Majesty The Queen and her family.The quality of our social care system should be a key issue at this election.The speed with which the failings of our social care system were exposed last spring was ghastly.The Covid crisis didnrsquot bring about the crisis in social care, it was already there.It simply brought it to the top of the agenda.The challenge of Covid- has made the crisis in care even more acute.The movement of people from hospital settings, without consultation and without being tested, into care homes to accommodate Covid patients was a human rights scandal.This contributed to the devastating reality of care homes becoming the epicentre of the pandemic and almost a third of deaths across the country being people from care homes.Scotlandrsquos social care workers have also been on the frontline in the fight against Covid.Their commitment, alongside all our other frontline workers, to help keep us safe during this public health emergency has been heroic.Scottish Labour has been calling for a National Care Service for some years now, a service that will include local governmentrsquos social care staff as partners in the service delivery.It will put the dignity of iniduals and the quality of services before profit.We must address the inequalities in the sector as it deals with the shortcomings highlighted in the recent Feeley Report, which I donrsquot think goes far enough.Scotland urgently needs a plan to transform social care. Scottish Labour knows that urgent reform and investment is needed and thatrsquos why we are working with the public to make our vision for a National Care Service a reality.We donrsquot want to just talk about the problems, we want a plan for how things could be better.Charles Dundas A QUESTION which I keep being asked during this campaign is what will the Scottish Liberal Democrats do for those in our communities who are struggling to make ends meet, especially those with children I know that all parties are committed to reducing child poverty, but here is what I want to do about it.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats will commit to doubling the Scottish Child Payment.This is currently available at pound per week to eligible children under six.This will rise to take in under-s in the next few years and we will pay pound per week.We are also keen to listen to campaigners who want to extend the payments to include disabled children or those with disabled parents.It was Liberal Democrats who reintroduced free school meals and targeted extra money to schools who needed it most in England, and in Scotland we will extend free school meals to cover all primary school pupils all through the year, including school holidays.This will also help these children with their education since a hungry child finds it dficult to focus and learn.The Scottish Lib Dems also pledge to increase the amount of free childcare Scotland offers, increasing it to a full , hours for every two-year-old.At the moment only some twoyear-olds are eligible, and takeup of the places is very low.By expanding the scheme, wersquod hope it would be more useful to more and more working parents, helping them get back to work and all the benefits that brings to society and the economy.We will also extend the number of summer clubs on offer to eligible children to help parents on low incomes with the costs of childcare during the school holidays.Plus, our manesto pledge on fuel poverty will also help us with child poverty.Warm homes with lower heating costs undoubtedly help the families who need it most, and I think that Midlothian North and Musselburgh would benefit from more Liberal Democrat policies like these in place after the election.Iain Whyte AS PART of my campaign, I have been highlighting the need for more local policing and ato locally based crime prevention across the constituency.This should be backed by visible local police patrols in our neighbourhoods to deter and detect crime.So, it was disappointing to read news articles this week highlighting police advice to Musselburgh householders about securing their garden sheds due to a spate of breakins.The crimes seem to have been concentrated in the Stoneybank area but the advice is valuable for everyone.Police say you should make sure your shed is secure and should fit an alarmthere is anything valuable inside.The alarms can be provided free to elderly and vulnerable residents: email MusselburghWestCPT@scotland.pnn.police.ukSince Police Scotland was formed, there has been a centralisation of our policing that I want to see reversed.During that time, public awareness of police patrols fell from  to  per cent.I know from my time as chair of Lothian and Borders Police Board that locally based crime prevention had a really positive impact.Crime fell and communities felt far more connected to their local officers, who they knew were working on their priorities.Thatrsquos why I want to see beefed-up neighbourhood policing teams and theirin the parts of the constituency where they have been reduced or removed.These teams work well on a preventative agenda.They solve problem issues and work with the community sorting things like housebreaking sprees and anti-social behaviour.I also strongly support the wider Scottish Conservative campaign to introduce a Local Policing Act to boost local police patrols and increase community engagement with policing decisions.This goes alongside our plan to tackle more serious crime by introducing a Victims Law to end the SNPrsquos soft-touch justice system.This would give judges the ability to put the very worst criminals behind bars for le.It would also end automatic early release, so that criminals must earn parole.Musselburgh residents need to see a more visible, local and responsive police service.That would be my aimyou elect me as your MSP."},{"url":null,"title":"boxing-world-champion-josh-taylor-vows-visit-aidan-hogg","story":"Josh will step into the ring with Jose Ramirez for the most important

If yoursquove never tried growing tomatoes, this could be the year to have a go!Getting startedSome gardeners begin with seed but ensuring the correct temperatures for germinating tomato seeds can be tricky. We find that most people prefer to buy their tomatoes as young plants, and these are available in pots at this time of year. Buying tomatoes as young plants also gives gardeners the opportunity to mix and match dferent ieties.Therersquos a vast range of ieties to choose from, which at first may seem quite disconcerting. So start by considering the type of tomato you prefer and the space you have available to grow them.Generally speaking, tomatoes are either grown on a single, upright stemor as a bush.If itrsquos your first time growing tomatoes, it might be easier to begin with one of the bush ieties, but read on and decide for yourself!Bush tomatoesTwo of our most popular bush-type ieties are lsquoTumblerrsquo and lsquoTumbling Tom Redrsquo but seedsmen are always improving ieties so take time to read the labels on the plants in the garden centre before making your choice.Bush tomatoes tend to have a slightly weeping habit, making them well-suited to being grown in pots, window boxes or hanging baskets. They tend to be relatively compact plants with numerous sideshoots producing clusters of tomatoes.Upright tomatoesAmongst the upright ieties lsquoAlicantersquo, lsquoMoneymakerrsquo and lsquoShirleyrsquo are well tried-and-tested, producing a good crop of full size, red tomatoes.For cherry tomatoes, lsquoGardenerrsquos Delightrsquo is by far the most popular choice amongst our customers.Upright tomatoes can be grown in pots, grow-bags or directly into the ground. As the plant grows, the stem needs to be kept straight so that it can bear the weight of the tomatoes and will require support either by canes or string.To maintain the strength of the main stem, sideshoots need to be nipped out. Sideshoots are the little shoots that appear in the angle between the leaf and the main stem and, as any tomato grower will tell you, itrsquos a job that requires to be done very regularly!Other ietiesTherersquos also a wide selection of yellow, beef-steak, plum and other distinctive ieties to choose from, so take your time to read the labels and choose the ieties that will best suit you, your garden and your family.CultivationAll tomatoes like a warm, sunny location to grow. Outdoor-grown tomatoeswill have to be well-sheltered, although there still needs to be some movement of air to avoid disease.Watering needs to be consistent and regular, and tomatoes growing in pots or growbags will benefit from having a tray underneath to provide a reservoir that they can draw from between waterings. Avoid irregular watering, as it results in uneven growth and may cause the tomatoes to split.Once you see the first bunch of yellow flowers appear, thatrsquos your first tomatoes on they way! The flowers will die off and the little tomatoes will begin to form ndash thatrsquos when gardeners will happily report that ldquothe first truss has set!Once the first truss is set, yoursquoll need to provide additional feeding and this is best done in liquid form whilst watering using a specialist feed such as the well-respected lsquoTomoritersquo, for example.As the season progresses, you may decide to remove some of the older leaves to let more light in and help the fruit ripen. For tomatoes that havenrsquot ripened at the end of the season, use them in the green for chutney or bring them indoors and leave them on the windowsill to ripen.And then...If yoursquove enjoyed growing your own tomatoes and plan to do it again next year, make sure that you remove the old plants completely so that yoursquore not leaving any rotting vegetation and disease that could affect next yearrsquos tomatoes.As always, the plant team are always very happy to help with tips and advice ndash so much easier now that wersquore allowed to be open again, of course!Yoursquoll also find lots of information on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"doors-reopening-dirleton-castle-tantallon-castle","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandis preparing to open the gates to more than  ticketed sites, including Tantallon Castle, near North Berwick, and Dirleton Castle, across the country this month.The historic sites will open on April  following the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed dates for the reopening of the tourism sector and mainland Scotland moving to Covid protection level three.New technology is also being implemented as part of HESrsquos new visitor offering.Visitors will be able to explore the stories of many of the sites in innovative ways through downloadable maps, family trails, quizzes and quests, music, poetry and personal accounts to tell stories throughout the centuries, videos exploring Gaelic culture and words, and digital fly-throughs to areas usually restricted to visitors.Visitors will be able to enjoy access to the historic outdoor spaces at both sites, as well as the Doocot, Gazebo, Hallyburton Range and first floor of the Ruthven Range at Dirleton Castle.All visitors, including members, will be required to pre-book tickets online and to use contactless payment where possible one-way systems will be implemented in some locations visitors must wear face coverings in any indoor enclosed spaces, including retail and catering areas and visitor numbers will be limited for safety reasons.Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: ldquoWe know how keen our members and visitors are to get back to our sites, so wersquore delighted to reopen over  per cent of our properties on April .ldquoScotlandrsquos heritage sector is a key part of our tourism offer ndash from providing jobs to increasing our wellbeing ndash and, in addition to reopening the sites that reopened last year, we will also reopen further sites on a phased basis over the upcoming months.Tantallon Castle will open daily, am-pm, from April , while Dirleton Castle will open on the same date and from then on will be open Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays between the same times.For more information, go to restarthistory.scot"},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prince-philips-visits-east-lothian","story":"On Friday, Buckingham Palace confirmed the news of his death, mere months before his th birthday, saying that he passed away peacefully last Friday morning at Windsor Castle.Since then people across the world have been sharing their condolences and been paying tribute to the late Duke, including here in East Lothian.Over the years the Duke of Edinburgh has visited East Lothian on several occasions, both solo and with the Queen, to whom he was married to for more than  years.From Haddington and North Berwick to Musselburgh and the opening of Yellowcraig Caravan Park in , he has visited several parts of the county over his  years.One of his first visits is believed to be in  with the then Princess Elizabeth, a year before her coronation.Over the years he re-visited the county on several occasions.Another was  when he inspected the British Legion parade in North Berwick, he also opened Yellowcraig Caravan park in .He has also visited Haddington on numerous occasions, in ,  and .Prince Philiprsquos last public visit is believed to be with the Queen, who was  years old at the time, to Musselburgh Racecourse in , when the couple helped it celebrate its th birthday.

the site where legend tells he was killed by a giant.Then, at Finnrsquos request, they walked to nearby Finlarig Castle.Izzy had always felt the castle had a sombre atmosphere, and so it did, even on this sun-drenched afternoon.Maybe itrsquos because it is quietly hidden away from the tourist trail, its unstable ruins concealed by old trees.Normally a tranquil place feels magical, but the grim deeds said to have been committed here darken the feelings.Izzy had already told Finn of the castle and he wanted to see the beheading pit and hanging tree.It was another built by the Campbell chief lsquoBlack Duncan of the castlesrsquo at the beginning of the s ndash such a ruthless man, andaccounts of him were true, very cruel even for his time.At Finlarig, it is said, he enacted his lsquojusticersquo, in particular against the MacGregors, whose land he had taken and whom he hunted mercilessly.Finn stood in the pit where, according to tradition, noble victims were executed.Their Campbell persecutors could watch and gloat from a window above in the tower.Nearby was the hanging tree, where people of lesser status were said to have met their end.Finn found the overgrown steps that led to the summit of the small hill on which the tree grew.They stood on the spot where so many condemned men would have had their last view of this world.ldquoYoursquore right, aunty, this place does have a bit of a gothic atmosphere, especially when you know that so many people were hanged on the branches of this tree.Izzy nodded: ldquoBut remember, Finn, eventhis is the original hanging tree, then it is innocent, she said as they stood under its boughs.ldquoThe poor thing was used to commit terrible crimes, she put her hand on its trunk, ldquobut it wasnrsquot the treersquos fault.Finn wasnrsquot sureshe was joking itrsquos just a tree, how could it be blamed He put it down to his auntrsquos love of nature.She often spoke asplants and animals were like people.Finn looked around.ldquoCan you tell me a story about this place  he asked.Izzy thought for a moment, then agreed.They sat on a stone by an old holly tree in the sunshine and Izzy told two stories.First, the tale of a wedding at the castle interrupted by MacDonalds lting cattle.Then she told the tale of Marion Campbell, a daughter of a powerful Campbell chief.She had been promised to a man she didnrsquot love, but instead she eloped with Gregor Roy MacGregor, the chief of the MacGregors.ldquoThe sad thing is, explained Izzy, ldquothat beforehand the MacGregors and Campbells had been close allies for many generations, but then a feud over land and power developed.So Gregor Roy was forced into the hills as an outlaw, and Marion willingly joined him, marrying him against her fatherrsquos wishes.ldquoDespite their tough le, said Izzy, ldquothey deeply loved each other.Finn was fascinated as Izzy told Finn stories of their adventures of how they lived in the wilds, living in secret hideouts, hunted by the warriors of Marionrsquos father.She told the tale of how Gregor once escaped his pursuers by leaping over a river and how Marion gave birth to their first son in a cave.ldquoThey wrought vengeance on the Campbells, lting their cattle, said Izzy, ldquobut eventually they were found and Gregor was beheaded by a Campbell chief called Grey Colin in .ldquoIn the beheading pit  asked Finn.ldquoNo, not here, said Izzy, ldquobut at another castle at the east end of Loch Tay.\"Some accounts say poor Marion was forced to watch, and afterwards she composed a beautul lament, which is a sad song.\"She wrote it for her son, to explain to him what had happened to his father.Izzy recited a verse she could remember: ldquoEven in snow and blizzards, And days with all the seasons, Gregor would find a hollow for me, In which we would sleep cosily.ldquoWow, what a story. What happened to her after  asked Finn.Izzy shook her head: ldquoNobody knows, she disappears from history, but her son Alistair later avenged his fatherrsquos death and so the feuding continued, which explains the grim deeds at this castle.ldquoMaybe her son protected her after and hid her to keep her safe, wondered Finn.ldquoThatrsquos a nice thought, maybe.Finn stood up and walked around.ldquoIt would be betterfolks could just get on, donrsquot you think! he announced.ldquoAgreed! said Izzy.They walked back to the village.They had a much-needed wash with hot water and Finn called his mum.After a while, he poked his head out of the phone box: ldquoMum wants to talk to you.Izzy knew how dficult this time was for her sister, being separated from her son overnight for the first time in four years.But Izzy was trusted by her and Finnrsquos attachment to his aunt was very strong and made him feel safe.He was obviously missing his mother, but he seemed to be enjoying the journey and his moods had been better, so it was decided the journey could continue.ldquoRemember, mumrsquos back from Spain on Monday eve.ldquoI know, smiled Izzy, ldquowe will be there to meet her, I promise.After the call, they did some shopping and made a quick visit to the Folk Museum, which was housed in the old mill by the side of the river.Izzy wanted to show Finn St Fillanrsquos Stones, which were on display there ndash a tale to tell later when they went for a swim in his pool.As they walked back onto the bridge, Izzy had a surprise.She unlocked the gate which led to the old MacNab burial ground, where chiefs of the clan lie in a walled enclosure, their clan folk in the surrounding ground.ldquoItrsquos actually an island in the middle of the river, explained Izzy.ldquoIts name means yellow island. It was a prehistoric fort before it was a burial ground.Finn nodded as he walked round the edge, looking through the trees down at the river as it roared, then calmed its way to Loch Tay.Izzy spotted a carving of the MacNab crest, with an image of the head of a MacNeish chief, a reminder of a famous incident in the clanrsquos history.ldquoIrsquom getting hungry, aunty, said Finn.She had a plan for tea.They would eat within the ruins of Rob Royrsquos house at Auchinchisallen in Glen Dochart.It was a -minute drive west of Killin.They parked at a small layby just past the small bridge that took the busy traffic over the burn called Allt Coire Chaorach.ldquoThat there  asked Finn, pointing at the ruins.ldquoLooks like mostly a pile of stones with a chimney.ldquoItrsquos called Rob Royrsquos house, letrsquos have our tea there, said Izzy.ldquoReally, it was his house  How do we get to it It was a good question.Once they got over the gate, they followed a narrow bracken-covered path.They got scratched as they scrambled up a steep slope, but suddenly they were on the top and the ruined house was in front of them.They were only a short distance from the road, but it felt like a dferent world.Finn stood on a large stone that once formed part of the foundations and looked up at the one gable end that was still standing.No, it wasnrsquot just a pile of stones, he thought, he could see it had been a house.Finn scanned the landscape around him.Occasional traffic could be heard not far below, but the road seemed engulfed and made insignicant by the mountains and hills that dominated the view.A herd of highland cattle were grazing nearby.ldquoLook, look! We have our own Highland cows! Finn called to his aunt.ldquoPerfect, she said as she her puffed her way to the house.Finn jumped from the stone down to his aunt.ldquoSorry, let me help, he said.ldquoLetrsquos get set up said Izzy, laying the heavy rucksack down.Finn went for a closer look at the cattle while Izzy found a safe place to sit within the ruins.She got out the camping stove and began to cook.Finn joined her and they stared at the pasta as it twirled in the boiling water.The cows came to watch, standing in a row, tails twitching with a fascinated look on their faces.ldquoYoursquore right in what you said, aunty, remarked Finn between mouthfuls of pasta.Izzy curled her eyebrows not sure what he was referring to.ldquoFood tastes much better when itrsquos cooked outside, in a place like this, he explained with a big sauce-covered grin.The sun was now lowering in the sky and Izzy could feel the air finally cooling.The huge presence of Ben More was casting shadows in the glen.She took out her small fire dish, screwed on its legs and placed it carefully within the ruins, away from any vegetation.Finn suggested moving some stones to make more comfortable seats.ldquoWe are guests here, said Izzy, ldquowe are sitting amongst old ruins, and we must leave them exactly as we found them. Even our wee fire must leave no trace. There used to be a sign here telling people about this place, but people just didnrsquot respect it, theyrsquod damaged it or trash it, so the sign was taken away. We know better, so we are welcome guests.Finn nodded. He initially felt upbraided, but his aunt gave him a kind smile which changed the meaning of her words.Instead of feeling scolded, he felt a strange sense of privilege that hersquod been taught something important.ldquoThink how long this house has been here, said Izzy, who looked up at the gable end with the chimney.ldquoThat standing wall was added later, but it is said Rob built the original house here in .

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likely that you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protection it is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect others than people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their own they need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optional in more places.We are optimistic that immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twist here, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellip... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one isimmunity doesnrsquot last long enough without a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one isthe virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.The gradual easing of restrictions that have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travel might need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"inveresk-street-branded-unremarkable-glazing-firm","story":"East Lothian planners refused planning permission for the new windows in the house on Wedderburn Terrace, Inveresk.Planning officers argued that the modern window frames were harmful to the character of the Inveresk conservation area.However agents for CR Smith, who were supported by the home owner in the appeal, argued that the locale of the property was ldquounremarkable.In an appeal statement to East Lothian Councilrsquos local review body, they said: ldquoWhilst the Inveresk Conservation Area in its entirety is undoubtedly worthy of its conservation area status, this stretch of Wedderburn Terrace is comparably unremarkable, without any buildings or vistas that would warrant protection in their own right.Inveresk is a conservation areaThe appeal came after planners refused retrospective permission for the windows and doors of the property to be replaced using PVC.Agents argued that the new material was not only more energy efficient than the original timber frames but offered more security given ldquoa number of house burglaries in the area.They pointed to other properties on the street which had similar window frames, producing a montage of images of other homes in the area to back them up.And they said of the house itself: ldquoIt is a reasonable attempt by a homeowner to improve the energy efficiency and security of his modest and unremarkable home.At the local review body meeting, Councillor Norman Hampshire, chairing, agreed that the new windows on the house, which dates back to the s, did not have an impact on the conservation area.He said: ldquoIf it had been a listed building, I would be minded to go with the officers however, on this building I do not think its impact on the conservation area will be signicant.His view was backed by fellow body members Councillor Jeremy Findlay and Councillor Kenny McLeod, who agreed unanimously to uphold the CR Smith appeal and allow the windows to remain."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-become-mini-blackpool-claim","story":"Stirling Stewart, owner of The Rocketeerin North Berwick, has applied for a series of occasional licences to allow him to serve alcohol at an outside seating area from the end of this month.However, the move has brought more than a dozen complaints from local residents after his proposal suggested using Anchor Green, which borders the restaurant.

Ever since Scotland emerged at the end of what scholars no longer call ldquothe Dark Ages, it has been a multilingual nation. A time-traveller visiting what is now Scotland around the year  would encounter speakers of Old Northumbrian in the south-east, of Celtic ieties across large swathes of the country, and of Old Norse , the language of the Vikings, in the far north and dotted around the coast and islands. Shetland and Orkney, in particular, were settled by many Norse speakers, as recorded in the Old Icelandic Orkneyinga saga, the earliest manuscript-witness of which survives from the th century. Native speakers of Orkney Norn were still to be encountered in the late eighteenth century, and present-day Orkney Scots retains many Norn-derived forms. One such word is souk.According to the Dictionaries of the Scots Language , souk sook has several meanings, many of them derived from the Old English verb s#can ldquosuck a sook is an evocative Scots word for a toady, for instance. However, the word found in Orkney and Shetland seems to have a distinct etymology, being traced to the Old Norse noun suacutegr ldquodrying wind.

Then, the SNP was given every possible advantage ndash perhaps the pro-UK side was over-confident. The nationalists were given the choice of wording ndash which many found slanted towards those proposing breaking up the UK. They were given the crucial Yes choice, which many experts claim gives about an automatic five per cent advantage, as well as choice of age eligibility and date and other give-aways. That the nationalists contrived to lose after all that says much.In Canada, beset for years by a separatist movement in Quebec similar to the SNP, the central government eventually acted. It had to ndash two lost referendums and continuing calls for another that were destroying Quebecrsquos economy. It decided to alter the wording of any future referendum to reflect what was actually involved in breaking up Canada. It became instead of a Yes or No, a Stay or Leave choice. The people were forced to think and the separatist movement has stalled, perhaps aware of the answer it would get in another referendum. Many think the present situation there is permanent.A recent Survation poll, taken March -, found that when Scots were askedthere was a referendum with the question: \"Should Scotland leave or remain part of the UK rsquorsquo,  per cent voted to remain and % to leave.The infinitely clearer Leave-Remain choice will reflect much more the true feelings of the people of this country.

I am well aware of the consequences of Brexit on business and people and did not mention Brexit.He goes onto ask why would employers train our young people in career development when \"oven-ready\" well-educated immigrants were ready available. Maybe he should be asking why our young people are not \"oven-ready\". There can be no excuse for the failure of the educational shambles today for which I would hold this Government accountable and not, as it would have us believe, another problem caused by immigration.His assumption that our young people in the future will only be offered harvesting and fruit picking is so pathetic it could be coming from the mouth of Ms Patel as she makes her case for her answer to the immigration problems caused mainly by her party. It also suggests that our young people are incapable of making a success of le as they see it and have no ambition. Anyone who pays attention when young people speak will realise that is not the case.His implication that jobs working the land as somehow beneath us is deplorable. This work was open to everyone but our young people mainly declined the offer.If Mr. Maclean really thinks that every young person is interested in a career and further education, maybe he could advise all those with a degree working in pubs, or worse still, without a job, where exactly all these career jobs are.Michael Tolland, Glasgow.LETS HAVE A LOCAL COMMUNITY CHARGEHAVING read Martin Williamss exclusiveit struck me that rather than revisiting the old domestic rates system to fund council spending, could we not consider a fairer system based upon a basic standard charge for services such as bin collections, road   pavement maintenance, street lighting and the like ndash common services which we all use, which could be set by local councils This should be set at a fairly low ratewhich would be paid by everyone over school age regardless of income level. If a council had to spend more money regarding exceptional costs, for example, tidying up litter andalism, it would increase the charge the following year to recoup the money. This would have the added advantage of focusing peoples minds that these services have a cost and could possibly lead to a change of mentality ndash you might be less inclined to litteryou are paying for it to be cleaned up.We could call this the Local Community Charge.The second part of funding for the councils would be based on ability to pay. This could be achieved by the Scottish Government increasing income tax by anything up to the devolved three per cent and earmarking this amount to be shared by the local councils, possibly based on council area population, or some other fair system could be devised. This could also be topped up from central government grants.Although I am not an expert in local government finance, I would imagine that this would be a fairly simple system to operate .A fair business rates system is another matter.B Bennie, Renfrew.THE MAN FROM MORAYI WOULD have hoped that someone with the very northern name Ron McKay would have known that the person he referred to in the poemis the Bonnie Earl OrsquoMoray, the north-east shire, not a Glaswegian Earlamurray, or even from the Murray lands in Southern Perthshire as he was a Stewart.

Curiously, in mayhem and bloodshed, fives hold a striking resemblance to the first reel of Saving Private Ryan. There is an inevitable body count in fives.Much rubbish has been written about sport, a signicant amount of it by me. But there is some truth in the theory that it can provide a window into the human soul. This was never more evident than when considering the personality, the character and the hidden shallows of onersquos opponents in five-a-side matches.Racism can make whipping boys of the most famous menFives is almost exclusively an amateur sport. There is the occasional pro tournament but these are a trivial adjunct to the -a-side game. Fives is for the guys and gals in a iety of strips with a range of skills and distinct dferences in opinions as to the fitness levels required.My experience is with the male of the fives species, for obvious reasons. It is more than  years since I have played fives but I still wince at the memory. Recent and brief experience as a spectator showed me little had changed.Yes, more players wear replica shorts now. In my day, you were more likely to see a replica semmit, in that it precisely resembled your darsquos vest. Footwear is generally more sophisticated, too. The fives of the s were the sole preserve of the gutty or the ten-bob slider as these unsponsored trainers were known.The body shape of the players is familiar to those who played in a bygone age. There are basically two types: the fit and the fat. Intriguingly, the better players usually fall into the latter category.The fit career around with a scant observance of any tactical discipline and only a fleeting relevance to where the ball is. The fat play judiciously and efficiently, only deigning to run for three pacesit is deemed absolutely necessary, as in to convert a definite scoring chance or the hall being on fire. The latter occurrence would be carefully gauged, of course, before any intemperate and undignied jogging.The central point about fives, of course, is the violence. It is more refined now but it still exists. In my day, it was as physical as wolverines playing rugby. There is a line of thought that posits that Dana White must have viewed these collisions and come up with the observation: ldquoLetrsquos take away the ball, make it one a side and call it the Ultimate Fighting Championship.rsquorsquoPerhaps, but what is certain is that Conor McGregor would never have survived the fives at the s Cowane Centre in Stirling or the ious venues where the Glasgow Herald employees played. The latter moved around sports venues in the manner of the Mongol hordes tearing across ious plains.Whether in Stirling or in some benighted hall in Bishopbriggs, there was always one constant. Aggression was a prerequisite for every player. But there was always one.

He wore the same five shirts in rotation every week. Prominently displayed on his desk was a picture of two beautul children, alongside a mug denoting the Worldrsquos Best Dad. His array of pens and pencils included a Parker, never used, that was given to him by his we when he became a team leader.His stapler had his name on it. He had some sticky backed paper to which he applied his name and then placed on his half-pint of milk before depositing same in the fridge.On a Friday, the classic fives day, he would bring his bag and leave it by his desk. Al Caponersquos hitmen liked to keep their machine guns close at hand, too.Inside the bag, the kit was impeccable. Outside the bag, Clive was diabolical. It was worse for the unwary who changed alongside this affable chap who spoke quietly of a forthcoming fun weekend with the family before making Friday afternoons a homage to the final scene of Reservoir Dogs.An unsuspecting clerk from the personnel department would be dwelling on the ball before realising, only seconds later, that he was on an unforgiving gym floor with his leg at an unusual angle. Some time later the haunting sounds of a siren would be heard on the Glasgow air. Clive would express bemusement at the effect of his challenge.This could and would become a theme. It was not always Clive, of course. There were more than enough psychopaths to go around. There still are.

Seriously, Ms Sturgeon was making a pertinent point. Which is that a staged fight over who is the most avid for independence might momentarily amuse the zealous, as they formed a ring, chanting ldquofight, fight, fight.She noted, however, that it would do nothing to impress those who remain unpersuaded by the merits of independence in the first place. They might simply turn away, faintly nauseated.Which is why the leitmot of Ms Sturgeonrsquos launch was continuity. As it has been for the entire campaign thus far.That seems to me particularly apt this week. Today brings the funeral service for the Duke of Edinburgh. The arrangements are, inevitably and rightly, suppressed by Covid.But, still, the gathering at Windsor offers a visible reminder of the core constitutional continuity presented by the Royal Family, alongside the collective desire to give thanks for a le of long and devoted service.Events occasionally conspire, Oprah Winfrey et al, to make many of us contemplate the Royal Family asthey were stars in a soap opera, a source of innocent merriment or exaggerated empathy.They are, of course, much more. They are ldquothe firm. They are the much-altered but still salient Royal prerogative. They are the palpable core of the United Kingdom.When party leaders at Holyrood paid tribute this week, it was left to Patrick Harvie of the Greens to note, en passant, that support for the institution of Monarchy was not universal in Scotland. However, he subsumed this Republican thought beneath personal sympathy for the Queen and her family.:Coronavirus: From Indias double mutant to vaccine hesitancy and the supply slowdownNicola Sturgeon sounded a genuine, personal note as she evinced admiration for the wit and intellect of the Duke, whom she met frequently at Balmoral and where. They shared, she disclosed, an intense interest in books.But her general theme was, again, one of continuity. The Dukersquos role as a constant companion to the Queen, the cherry trees they planted in the grounds of Canongate Kirk, which she hoped would thrive and bloom for many years.Of all the sundry institutions which comprise the UK State, it has long struck me that the Palace gets devolution best. Perhaps alongside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which, as one mandarin once told me with a wry grin, is well used to dealing with troublesome colonies.The Palace appreciates the need to work with the UKrsquos devolved apparatus. For example, the Sovereign regularly travels to her palace of Holyroodhouse to welcome new First Ministers from over the road, rather than obliging them to sojourn to London.While representing continuity, the Palace is adaptable. Within limits, it moves with the times, often cajoled down the decades by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queenrsquos own speeches to the Scottish Parliament constantly endorse devolved governance.However, the Queen has also been known, very occasionally, to express disquiet at potential constitutional change.In , as Scottish devolution was under active discourse, the Sovereign said she could readily understand such aspirations but could not forget that she was ldquocrowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.More recently, in , days before the independence referendum, the Queen was also in contemplative mood, perhaps prompted by advisers. Asked about the ballot by a by-stander outside Crathie Kirk, she said that she hoped people would think very carefully about the future.Nicola Sturgeon thoroughly understands this nuanced approach by the wary Palace to the malleable UK constitution.She studiously avoids placing any question marks against the Regal Union of . She is not about to pick a fight, arm wrestling or otherwise, with the Monarchy.However, she does maintain a standing challenge to the Parliamentary Union of . She does want, in the word of the moment, to affect transformational change there.Yet she also understands that, right now, the people of Scotland remain deeply, deeply apprehensive and unsure about their future.:Kevin McKenna: Recover from the virus and a referendum  We can do bothThey contemplate the pandemic, this hideous plague, and they fret. They also cast their minds back to the banking crisis of , from which we have yet to recover. They consider too the disruption of Brexit, which may or may not resolve itself.Folk need reassurance. Which is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon was attempting to offer this week, most notably with regard to indyref but also in her policies on income tax.Ms Sturgeon declared that tackling Covid must come first, with indyref on hold until the middle of the new Parliament. She opts for popular pragmatism. She calculates that there is little to be gained from evoking the spirit of William Wallace, or even Robert the Bruce.Once more, it is easy to understand why this might exasperate the most eager adherents of the independence cause. Incidentally, it also irks the Conservatives who yearn for constitutional wrestling arms, feet, whatever.This week, also, there was some passing interest in a poll which suggested that fewer than one in five of the Scottish population ranked independence as among the most important issues at this election.That did not surprise me. Constitutional questions, even independence, are generally second order matters, unless a population is actively experiencing oppression, either physical or spiritual.By ldquosecond order, I do not remotely intend to say that such matters are unimportant. Merely that they are dferent, that they are regarded by the people as conduits towards the issues which dominate their thoughts, such as employment, health and security.That is the error the Tories previously made when they used to say that devolution was never raised on the doorsteps. They needed to ask a second question: how best might you address the concerns you have raised Nicola Sturgeon gets that distinction. She understands the yearning for stability in a time of turmoil.

The manesto, for modern political parties, resembles a catalogue of things they would like to see.

The voters are therefore entitled to regard it, and the offerings of the other parties, as a shopping list and, like all shopping lists, assess whether they would like those particular items, and ask how much theyrsquoll cost.Whatrsquos more, cynical though it may seem, since no political party of any sort ever elected anywhere has delivered every single manesto promise ndash it would be fairer to the parties, and more honest, to call them ldquoambitions ndash voters are entitled to take a sceptical approach when considering whether proposed measures are a desirable b affordable c likely to happen.All parties offer policies they think will gain them support: when it comes to something like Brexit or independence, or even issues such as voting reform or nationalisation, voters may already have firm views on which they favour, or be open to persuasion. Party positions are likely to be clear.When it comes to spending priorities, manesto claims are more likely to be both blatantly populist and challenged by political opponents on the grounds of affordability and credibility. The more of them there are, the easier it is to present them as unrealistic.The SNPrsquos proposals ndash which supporters will no doubt characterise as ambitious and offering real improvements ndash are certainly wide-ranging enough to have been greeted with incredulity by opposition parties. To promise a  per cent rise in NHS spending over the parliament, free dentistry, pilot schemes on universal basic income and a four-day week, free laptops and bicycles for schoolchildren, increased education, mental health and other public spending, while at the same time ruling out any rise in income tax, is to invite the question of where the money is coming from.Other parties will have similarly ambitious and superficially attractive policies that deserve equally close scrutiny: the Tories, as well as spending with abandon across the UK, are promising , more teachers and extravagant transport projects Labour aims to guarantee a job for every young Scot, as do the LibDems the Greens want to spend pound. billion and create , jobs. Any or all of these plans may well be judged undesirable, costly or unrealistic.Nor are they votersrsquo sole criteria: the drubbing Labour received at the last General Election may have been due to people thinking its manesto expensive and fancul, but other factors, such as Brexit and Jeremy Corbynrsquos personal qualities, may have been more important. Inidual members of the electorate may prioritise independence or the Union, a partyrsquos general stance on, for example, the economy, or their judgment of its leadersrsquo competence and integrity.But the fact that the SNP has been in government for  years is bound to place its manesto plans under closer scrutiny. Any partyrsquos record in government should be a consideration: has it delivered on previous promises  Have matters, in any given sphere, improved or deteriorated According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Holyrood is already spending pound. for every pound of public spending in England and Wales, almost all of it provided by the Barnett formula.

And to counteract the problem, the charter granted to George, Earl of March and his heirs the right to create Dunbar a lsquofreersquo burgh, with burgesses given the right to trade and the establishment of a market cross in the town.The first mercat cross would probably have consisted of a simple wooden pillar on a stone base and would later have been replaced by a more permanent stone structure, said Herbert Coutts, chair of a working group made up of Dunbar Community Council, Dunbar Trades Association, local branch of Rotary and Dunbar and District History Society which is behind the new research into the cross.ldquoFor almost four centuries it was the focus of the trade in goods in the burgh, he added.But by the th century towns across Scotland ndash including Dunbar ndash were in the grip of modernisation. Itrsquos thought the mercat cross was seen as a nuisance which obstructed traffic through the high street and was dismantled.That might have been the end of the cross saga. However, the early th century saw a new movement emerged that was more appreciative of historical and architectural heritage.A drive to preserve buildings and structures for future generations placed pressure on local authorities to act as s of their local heritage.Mr Coutts suspects a  letter to the Burgh Council from HM Office of Works in Parliament Square in Edinburgh calling for modern additions to the late th century Town House ndash originally Dunbarrsquos tolbooth and gaol - to be removed, sparked a search for parts of the missing mercat cross.As luck had it, a stone pillar was suddenly found in the garden of one of the townrsquos banks and quickly declared to be the missing mercat cross shaft.It was lowered into place outside the Town Hall in  by local builder George Cunningham, complete with gargoyles finial ndash an unusual addition, as most mercat crosses featured either baronial emblems, a lion or a unicorn - and a modern cement thistle perched on top.However, while the council enjoyed the plaudits for its \"enlightened spirit\" and having ldquorediscovered the long forgotten cross documents emerged which suggested the original cross had really been used in the mid-th century to construct a new well for the town.Claims swirled that the towns reborn cross was a ldquopseudo mercat cross, with no original elements, and its gargoyle features probably retrieved from a medieval hospital or church.Now fresh investigations are being carried out in the hope of unravelling the truth behind the cross, as part of anniversary celebrations to mark the th anniversary of Dunbarrsquos burgh status.It has led to a theory that the stone pillar probably came from the townrsquos th century Black Bull coaching inn, known for generations as ldquothe Pillars, a reference to the ldquowell-marked entrance to the stables and outbuildings of the property.Mr Coutts said: ldquoThere was a need among the magistrates to tidy up the tolbooth in the early th century. Someone might have said that the town didnrsquot have a mercat cross yet it was a royal burgh.ldquoThey decided they should have a restored mercat cross. That was not that unusual, as there are not that many original medieval mercat crosses in Scotland instead you tend to get fragments of them.ldquoHowever, when they assembled the cross and put it in front of the Town House in , it was quoted as being from the original mercat cross.ldquoWe have what has been described as Dunbar mercat cross for the last century, even though the ious elements of the cross come from dferent periods.Mr Coutts says the ldquopseudo cross still has an important role to play in Dunbarrsquos heritage, and is worthy of being conserved for future generations.He added: ldquoThe mercat cross has witnessed all the celebrations ndash people collect at the front of the Town House to welcome in the New Year, people were married in the Town House.ldquoIf stones could speak, it would have quite a story to tell about the le of Dunbar."},{"url":null,"title":"skye-ferry-set-sail-memory-man-kept-going","story":"For decades, the tiny but fierce MV Glenachulish has transported vehicles back and forth over the Kylerhea straits, offering visitors heading to and from Skye a more thrilling or soothing passage ndash weather dependent - than simply roaring over the bridge.For Chris Main, the little ferry - the last of her kind, built in  by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company in Troon and with a capacity for just six cars - was a precious slice of west coast le.Not only was she soaked in maritime heritage, built to serve tiny west coast communities until one bridge after the next stole away her passengers, Chris realised that she possessed a charm and unique allure that simply had to be preserved.One day, he believed, the little ferry ndash thought to be the worldrsquos last manually operated turntable ferry - would enchant a new kind of traveller, one who preferred to journey a little slower, to savour the scenery, chat with the locals and immerse themselves in west coast le.When the decision to remove tolls from the Skye bridge seemed to herald the end for the little Glenelg to Kylerhea ferry, he rallied the community to not only save the centuries-old crossing and the vessel but to tend to her aging Kelvin T engine and spruce her up with paint and polish so she would be a delightful compliment to the stunning scenery.Job done, those who knew him best say his love affair with the little ferry continued: barely a day passed without Chris, wearing his trademark kilt and Skye Ferry sweater, on the slipway with his flask of soup, greeting passengers and admiring the sight of MV Glenachulish on her five minutes journey between Glenelg to Kylerhea.Tied up for the whole of  due to coronavirus, the ferry across the sea to Skye is now preparing to restart operations on  May.:Skye Bridge:  years since opening and tolls controversyBut it is a bittersweetto work. For this season it will be without her biggest champion.Chris, who by all accounts poured heart and soul into keeping the ferry afloat and helped pioneer a new kind of islandsrsquo tourism and almost single-handedly put the area on the tourism map, died earlier this year.ldquoHe was one of those people who seemed well known anywhere in the world, says Jo Crawford, general manager of the Glenelg Skye Ferry. ldquoHis enthusiasm and work to keep the ferry running, maintained and restored was phenomenal. He was synonymous with the ferry and never seen without his Skye Ferry jumper.ldquoThis season will be bitter-sweet, the ferry is his legacy.Indeed, without his determination, the little car ferry may well have ceased to operate two decades years ago, a move which would have surely dealt a fatal blow to the small Glenelg community.More so, he pioneered a new era of Highland tourism. Having taken over the crumbling Glenelg Inn in , he transformed it from a fire-ravaged Victorian wreck that had been derelict for four decades, introduced stylish rooms, an upscale restaurant, a superb collection of beer and whisky, and the first coffee machine in the Highlands.At a time when touring the remote parts of the west coast could be a culture shock for travellers used to modern comforts, he helped inspire a new style of sophisticated yet authentic Highland welcome.According to Jo, saving the ferry did not just save a -year-old ferry crossing which gained fame when mentioned in James Boswells famous  travelogue, The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, but it helped to save the small community too.ldquoItrsquos hard to overstate how important the ferry is to this tiny village on the edge of the west Highlands, she says. ldquoTherersquos a mountain path from the main road to Glenelg, itrsquos one way in and one way out, andthe ferry isnrsquot there, then people would not bother to come.ldquoThat little corner of the village is dead when the ferry is not on.

It is pivotal in terms of supporting the Glenelg Inn, the pub, the shop...For centuries little ferries criss-crossed narrow stretches of water that separated west coast communities, providing lelines between the mainland.The Ballachulish Ferry Company was established in the s to cater for rising demand from vehicle owners. But as more bridges were built, the MV Glenchulishrsquos route changed several times.By  she was working the -yard crossing from Glenelg on the mainland to Kylerhea, the shortest sea crossing to Skye.However, the opening of the Skye Bridge in  transformed travel to the island. The decision to abolish the Skye Bridge tolls in  was the signal for the Glenelg ferryrsquos private owner, Roddy MacLeod, to retire, and daily crossings from Easter to October appeared to be at an end.ldquoLike any village, people had dferent opinions, says Jo. ldquoOne group thought we had to save this unique service, others thought there was no point because of the bridge.ldquoChris said we have to keep it going. He was visionary in many ways, he felt this would absolutely work.ldquoHe had experience of getting people to come here he had created a Highland idyll in his premises, he knew people will comeyou give them something unique and worth coming for.Convinced there was a market for unique and unusual experiences waiting to be tapped, locals launched the Isle of Skye Ferry Community Interest Company and applied for National Lottery and Highlands and Islands Enterprise funding.ldquoA massive amount of work needed to be done to the ferry, adds Jo, ldquobut Chris could see beyond that and money was raised to make sure she was restored.Passenger numbers were slow but the community held its nerve and launched a marketing drive that would do VisitScotland proud.ldquoThey knew they had to market it, because you could drive to the Isle of Skye and it would not cost a penny, she adds. ldquoYou could go over the sea to Skye from Mallaig on a big CalMac ferry. Why would people bother to go all the way down this hill to come here ldquoWe had to show people that what we have to offer is something they canrsquot get anywhere .The experience of travelling on the last ferry of its kind wasnrsquot enough. So, the community set about highlighting the satisfaction that came with keeping centuries of tradition alive, the chance to follow in generations of footsteps and the breath-taking scenery.ldquoYou could drop your camera on the slipway and still take a brilliant photo, itrsquos so utterly beautul here, adds Jo. ldquoYou can see sea eagles pretty much every day, otters, a billion seals and all sorts of bird le, dolphins, porpoises, we even see basking whales.ldquoWe also see a lot of ferry nerds here who know their stuff.

Colon cancer took its toll, and he died, aged , in January.His children, daughter Poppy, and son Joss, faced with saying their goodbyes in an era of covid restrictions launched a JustGiving memorial page to raise some money in their fatherrsquos memory which could go towards supporting his beloved ferry.In a few months, the figure has so far ballooned to pound,, with messages from people around the world recalling meeting their father and how touched they were for his love for Glenelg and the ferry.While in Glenelg, the community has agreed that the recently built shore station should carry the name of its most fervent supporter.ldquoIt feels strange, says Poppy. ldquoMy father was a big part of a lot of peoplersquos lives. When I say Irsquom from Glenelg, people seem to know of it and know my dad.ldquoHe thought Glenelg was magical, and that we needed to bring people here so they could fall in love with it too.ldquoAnd he thought the ferry was quite special, she was Scottish built and the last of her kind.ldquoHe was absolutely passionate about the ferry.

We forget that before this, in the s, the country was torn apart by a bitter factional civil war which itself brewed over from an even earlier conflict, that against the Soviet occupation in the s.Should anyone have forgotten during these past  years why America went to Afghanistan in the first place, it invaded in  to oust the Taliban, who were providing sanctuary for Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the   attacks.Bin Laden has been dead for a decade now and while al-Qaeda still has pockets in Afghanistan, and still co-operates with the Taliban ndash despite Taliban assurances to the contrary ndash the US intelligence community believes the group is no longer able to pose a credible threat to the US homeland.Now, exactly  years to the day after those attacks on the US that triggered the ldquowar on terror and the invasion and occupation that has cost an eyewatering trillions of dollars, America will remove its ldquoboots on the ground leaving Afghanistan and its people to an uncertain fate.ldquoThree hours and they could be right here in Kabul, in fact many are already operating in covert groups in the city as you know, David, one Afghan friend reminded me of the Talibanrsquos omnipresence around the capital when I was last there just before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.Since then, the insurgents have stepped up their deliberate targeting of local journalists, particularly women, as well as rights activists and civil society leaders. More than , civilians were killed or wounded in attacks during the first three months of , up  per cent from the same period last year, according to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan .The violence runs in tandem with negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, heightening concerns about preserving freedom of expression and womenrsquos rights in any peace settlement.Fears of the peopleTIME and again Afghans told me of their fears over an American pullout and of concerns that the countryrsquos security forces might well collapse without the support of the US-led coalition that at times has comprised up to  countries including the UK, France, Germany, and Australia.So, with the departure of US troops imminent, what now does the future hold for Afghanistan and its people  The first thing to say in answering this question is that itrsquos important to recognise why America chose now to leave.Ending a ldquoforever war for the US is only part of the story and clearly the Biden administration is convinced that its unconditional troop withdrawal might ramp up the pressure on both the Taliban and Afghan government to reach a peace deal.Both sides, for a long time now, have used the US presence as leverage. The insurgents through escalating violence while the Afghan government under president Ashraf Ghani has done so by putting himself at the front of the long established and often corrupt political gravy train. The president, too, failed to build the kind of relationship or ties with Washington that might have allowed a long-term, stabilising US troop presence.Hardly surprising, then, that few ordinary Afghans have much trust in Ghani who has consistently dragged his feet on any power-sharing or peace deal.While Ghani supposedly ldquowon the disputed September  elections with .% of the ballots, this has hardly legitimised his presidency. Many Afghans remain disillusioned by the electoral process because of direct political manipulation, corruption, or outright threats. Only . million among Afghanistanrsquos . million registered voters bothered to turn up. This is not even counting another five to six million Afghans of eligible voting age who never registered.Ghanirsquos nationwide mandate is questionable, as are his efforts to engage in any serious dialogue with either his immediate political opponents or the Taliban in trying to bring about peace and stability. As Foreign Policy magazine columnist Elise Labott summed it up last week: ldquoAfghans are coming to realise that Ghani can neither wage war nor make peace.Warlords embracedFURTHER undermining his credibility, Ghani has also embraced warlords he once shunned, like Uzbek powerhouse Rashid Dostum, accused of war crimes. These warlords are another potential wild card as Afghanistan enters a new and perilous phase.There are just too many old faces and political parties who have had access to power in some shape or form for years and will not relinquish it now. Many of these warlords, in a country awash with weapons, have substantial numbers of armed supporters which only adds to an already combustible political and military mix.Perhaps sensing how the US withdrawal has boxed him in politically, Ghani has recently ndash and reluctantly ndash proposed the formation of an interim government as a prelude to another election. But few are holding their breath and the bottom line is that Ghani has shown little enthusiasm for any power-sharing with the Taliban or anyone  that doesnrsquot include him as president.Seen from the Talibanrsquos perspective this matters little given that the insurgents hold the trump cards diplomatically and militarily because of the US drawdown. To date, the Taliban have even refused to sit across the table from Ghani.This is turn raises the spectre of escalating violence and perhaps another all-out civil war or even a takeover by the Taliban once the Americans are gone. Therersquos no doubt the insurgents sense a ldquovictory of sorts and have every reason for believing it possible.Despite a -year US presence, the Taliban currently hold or control up to % of Afghanistan including many provincial town and cities. They are within proximity, too, of Kabul and for a long time now have had a shadowy covert presence in the city terrorising the population and forcing the Afghan security forces to turn it into a labyrinth of checkpoints, emplacements, and blast walls. Any trip to the city gives the visitor that feeling of being hemmed in, surrounded. In such an intimidating environment, most Kabulis continue to fear the worst after the Americans leave with Ghani more isolated and the Taliban piling on the pressure.ldquoItrsquos hard to imagine any scenario under which peace would break out post-September  in Afghanistan, warned Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Programme at the US-based Wilson Centre speaking last week after news of the American deadline for a pull out.ldquoThe best hope is that the peace process wonrsquot be dead, Kugelman told the Associated Press, echoing the thoughts of many Afghanistan analysts and watchers.Most though are now pessimistic about the peace process with even the US intelligence communityrsquos own prediction outlined in its annual Threat Assessment published last week concluding that current peace talks are unlikely to succeed.Asto underscore that last week the Taliban boycotted a scheduled peace conference in Turkey, again throwing the whole future of the peace process into doubt.What matters nowthe worst-case scenarios are to be avoided is to urgently reassure Afghans that the most effective way of stabilising the country is by introducing a clean slate as far as representations goes.This is the proposal suggested by Edward Girardet and Peter Jouvenal, two veteran journalists and Afghan analysts who have reported on the Afghan conflict from its earliest stages, one arriving just prior to the Soviet invasion on December , , the other shortly afterwards. Writing recently in the online reportage magazine Global Geneva, they outlined in what they described as a ldquofeeler article the way in which an independently mediated peace process could be created.Itrsquos one that bypasses ldquoself-centred politicians, power-mongering warlords and abusive insurgents as well as ldquothe undermining of outside powers with their own geopolitical agendas or, evenwell-meaning, with policies that have consistently failed.The two authors also detailed what they describe as the need for a ldquonon-factional interim administration in Afghanistan. ldquoEvennot easy, the creation of such a transitional government involving - respected and erse Afghans remains the only viable way forward.ldquoIts representatives should come from dferent parts of the country and dferent walks of le from teachers, religious leadersand entrepreneurs to lawyers, farmers and civil servants, suggest Girardet and Jouvenal.Political squabblingTHEY stress that at least one-third should consist of womento guarantee the gains of women in Afghanistan. Equally important, they say, would be to exclude any officially designated government politicians or Taliban representatives, and to avoid political squabbling. The interim administration might be appointed by a neutral outside group, highly experienced outsiders well-respected by Afghans and who know the country well, such as former NGO co-ordinators and diplomats.Itrsquos a novel idea and precisely the kind of imaginative thinking that has been missing these past years from an international engagement that has focused more on the security dimension. But escaping that insecurity and instability to make such an administration viable would remain an enormous challenge and, as the authors point out, would doubtless face hard resistance from political traditionalists like Ghani and others as well as the Taliban.Should such a peace process and new administration fail to emerge then itrsquos almost certain Afghanistan faces a potentially disastrous time ahead.Knowing my own long association with the travails of this long-suffering country itrsquos perhaps not surprising that many people ask how I think all this will ultimately play out.Sad as it is to say but without the emergence of some new peace process and interim administration initiative of the kind outlined by Girardet and Jouvenal, I believe the country most likely faces a civil war along the lines of that experienced in the mid-s.During those devastating times I was to visit Kabul often as factional fighting tore the city apart in a way even the guerrilla war against the Soviet occupation and communists had failed to do.That period in the s was among the darkest days for Afghanistan in modern times and gave birth to the Frankenstein monster that became the Taliban. When so avoidable, what a tragedy it would beAfghanistan were to go through that madness all over again."},{"url":null,"title":"independent-scotland-lead-global-efforts-nuclear-disarmament---patrick-harvie","story":"Speaking in the run up to the May  Holyrood election, he insisted the UK is \"run by a corrupt government that wants to invest in expanding its nuclear arsenal\".But by leaving the UK, Greens believe Scotland could play a leading role in international efforts to build peace and tackle the climate emergency.:Patrick Harvie raises Prince Philips extreme wealth and privilege at Holyrood tributeBoth the Greens and the SNP want to see a second vote on independence take place in the next Holyrood term -there is a majority in the Scottish Parliament for this.And Mr Harvie said: \"The Scottish Greens provided a pro-independence majority in the last parliament and we are ready to do so again.\"He insisted: \"Scotland doesnt have to sit back and accept a Brexit race to the bottom run by an increasingly right-wing Tory party.\"With the potential and talent Scotland has in innovation and renewable energy, we could be leading European efforts to tackle the climate emergency.\"And by recognising that the nuclear weapons based in Scotland are illegal, we can lead global efforts in nuclear disarmament too.\":Why no support for green nuclear power Mr Harvie said his party wanted Scotland to be a \"new, outward-looking nation with our own seat at the European table, driving change across the continent and restoring the rights of workers\".And speaking ahead of campaigning in Dundee, he told voters: \"This election is a chance to endorse that vision and vote for the Scotland you want.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mps-have-no-ideas-no-desire-indy-claim-alba-members","story":"Kenny MacAskill and Neale Hanvey blasted some members of their old party and said they have spent more time ldquoplanning for COP attendance than they have for another referendum.The pair, who left the SNP last month to join Alex Salmondrsquos Alba party, said that they did so as a result of frustrations with the SNP Westminster group, their cosy relationship with the Westminster establishment, and their apparent lack of commitment to securing independence.Mr MacAskill, Alba MP for East Lothian, said: ldquoTherersquos more planning ongoing in the group, as far as I can see, for COP attendance than there is for a referendum.ldquoDiscussions began when I went to the first group meeting, raising issues such as what are we going to do to address the border, which is now the biggest issue rather than perhaps sterling.

But the Egyptian Halls ndash designed by Alexander ldquoGreek Thomson and first opened as a commercial base for an iron magnate  ndash are also dying.What is left of the New Palace ndash some records suggest it was also called China Palace ndash is more like archaeological dig than an abandoned eatery.Shafts of light shine through windows still painted with the Chinese characters of its name. Like laser pointers they pick out the roomrsquos architectural and design features: torn scraps of flock velvet burgundy wallpaper mirrored columns and exposed lath-and-plaster walls.At the rear, in what was once kitchens, there is a stack of the old restaurantrsquos bulbous s light fittings. They look like Greek amphorae.Amid the broken glass, the heaps of rotten, powdered plaster and the piles of timber there are abandoned tools, at least two rusted saws.But repairs never happen, not substantive ones anyway. No-one has raised the money to do them. Last week, Mr Souter was warned he would shortly be issued with a defective building notice ndash the latest in a seemingly endless series of twists and turns in the story of the Egyptian Halls.The building is historic but so too now is the bureaucratic and political saga over attempts to save it.Rescue packageTHE Halls have stood on Union Street, right opposite Central Station, Scotlandrsquos busiest, for a century-and-a-half. For the last four decades or so ndash ever since the New Palace and other tenants moved out ndash its upper storeys have been empty.Mr Souter, , and his two business partners have been trying to put together a rescue package for half that time.:Egyptian Halls fake facade unravels.He says he has been in contact with no fewer than  public officials and politicians since he first became involved around the turn of the century. He has dealt with several generations of civic leaders, planning and regeneration staffers as he aims to get public money to make redevelopment viable.The cost of that has ticked up over the years. A website run by Mr Souterrsquos development firms now puts the commercial deficit at pound million. However, the businessman declined to go into any further details, saying he believed a new, fth planning application was ldquoin the pipeline.As recently as , there was talk of demolition. The Egyptian Hallsrsquo classic facade ndash with Greek rather than Egyptian-style columns ndash has been covered with scaffolding and a protective membrane for more than a decade. Last year, Europa Nostra named it as one of the continentrsquos  most at-risk historic buildings.Various schemes have been mooted to turn the buildingrsquos upper street into a hotel and to regenerate the ground floor. But relations with local authorities have soured. Mr Souterrsquos website pins the blame for delays on the council.He has a specic gripe which stems from some of the legal complexity surrounding a compulsory purchase order of the building back in the s.Mr Souter says he was not made aware of a change in the terms of the CPO before he and his partners bought the property. The change, Mr Souter argues, gave a previous owner time to seek compensation and caused a delay to transferring the title to Mr Souterrsquos companies.Councilrsquos denialWHEN this grievance was aired in , Glasgow City Council denied ldquoallegations of misrepresentation and impropriety. A spokesman added: ldquoRather than ing to issues from the s, it may be betterthe buildingrsquos owners joinwith us in a co-operative manner to ensure the preservation and regeneration of this historic building.Mr Souterrsquos website suggests he isnow ready to reset relations with the council.ldquoThe past should not influence how we get to a solution, it declares. ldquoThere is a phenomenal potential to be realised. We need to get a balance of commercial funding and grant funding combined with projected valuation and income upltswe take a , , , -year perspective.ldquoAnd then assess this financial information with the up-to-date structural position given the Upper Floors have been vacant since , an astonishing  years ago and the efforts of the heritage stakeholders.Last year, as the Black Lives Matter protests welled in America and the UK, calls again mounted for Glasgow to have a Slavery Museum. The Egyptian Halls was mooted as a potential site for this though the building has no actual connection with trafficking or profiteering from trafficked people.That, Mr Souterrsquos website contends, might help plug the deficit. ldquoThere is now the option of the Museum of Slavery concept, which would deliver signicant tourism, cultural and educational benefits as well as probably unlocknon- commercial sources of funding, it says.:Egyptian Halls revival could cost up to poundmldquoAnd which, from Susan Aitken, Glasgow City Council leader, has found traction reiterating the councilrsquos support for either a standalone museum or a permanent exhibition dedicated to slavery and empire.lsquoNot giving uprsquoSPEAKING to The Herald on Sunday, Mr Souter struck a diplomatic but determined tone. ldquoDo I love the building  Definitely. Wersquove not spent  years trying to achieve the original objective to give up now when we believe a solution can be facilitatedeverybody lowers the temperature to pragmatic levels.Council officials, meanwhile, want to see concrete plans and meaningful action.The buildingrsquos design is very unusual and vulnerable. Its iron framehas been exposed. Signs warn visitors ndash who enter at their own risk and only in safety helmets ndash that the floors held up by the metal are now dangerous.But the Egyptian Halls are not just important on their own account. This is an anchor building on a street that many city insiders say could be one of Scotlandrsquos finest.An official spokesman for the local authority this weekend said: ldquoThe Egyptian Halls are undoubtedly an important part of both Glasgowrsquos cultural heritage and its urban fabric.ldquoCouncil officers have worked with the owners, over a number of years, to support the appropriate development of the building in order that it can be enjoyed by future generations.ldquoHowever, we have yet to see proposals that address the condition of the building and, as a result, we have informed the owner that we will be issuing a notice in the coming weeks.Souter travels from his native Dundee to the building every week, to check in with the ground-floor retail tenants. Above the shops, the only residents are pigeons in its attic floor.On the final landing of the Egyptian Halls, somebody has put two Marigold gloves on broom handles, waving to anyone who makes it in to what was once seen as a Thomson masterpiece."},{"url":null,"title":"bonnie-prince-bob-meet-indy-star-targeting-snp-edinburgh-central","story":"Being a persistent Glaswegian whose city sits proudly at the top of that table, I feel compelled to assert its credentials and see off the upstart. And so our jaggy conversation becomes profanity chess where the purpose is to bury your opponent under a pile of expletive compounds.:Top civil servant warns Boris Johnsons assertive unionism will lead to independenceI meet Bonnie Prince Bob near Broughton Street, the bouled which ferries New Town residents to their workplaces in Edinburghrsquos retail and business enclave. His campaign hub isan office broom cupboard converted into the studio where he produces music and makes digital art.From this place he also finesses a series of startling campaign videos which have set fire to a seat previously viewed exclusively as a contest of entitlement between the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives.Later, I meet the chief target of Bobrsquos campaign, Angus Robertson, former leader of the SNPrsquos Westminster group and the eloquent grandee who sells independence to Scotlandrsquos managerial classes. Robertson, who speaks fluent German, has just completed a history of early th-century Vienna. Bonnie Prince Bob is putting the finishes touches to a Jamaican reggae video.lsquoMakes no dferencersquoTHE main purpose of Bobrsquos campaign is to oppose Robertson and the SNP, and stop them ldquothinking they can just *****n waltz into my *****n city and annexe it as part of a *****n political property portfolio.ldquoBut whatall you do is split the *****n nationalist vote and help the Tories, I ask him. ldquoMakes no *****n dference to me, he says. ldquoIt would be just one *****n Tory replacing another, eh He speaks in the sort of working-class dialect that polite Edinburgh would rather you didnrsquot hear.

They had woken one Hogmanay to find barriers surrounding their streets for the purposes of protecting the profits of its winter festival.To Bob and other local campaigners, Edinburgh now exists merely to compete with the worldrsquos other manicured cities for the spending power of the global super-rich in their search for new ldquoexperiences. Its city centre has been hollowed out to give them space to indulge themselves free from having to actually interact with the people who live beyond the castle. Bob is what Labour candidates in Scottish elections might once have looked like. A self-taught local with a desire to speak for those lately reviled by Scotlandrsquos political classes, unashamedly Socialist, republican and radical. And, in his case, pro-independence, but not at any price.ldquoLook,I get elected Irsquoll only serve for one term. Irsquom not in this to make a career. I want to spend the next five years giving a voice to the people who are excluded from Holyrood and who get gas-lit by those who claim to represent them with their performative identity politics and hate-crime legislation.Like others I was captured by the SNPrsquos vision for an independent Scotland that rejected the corrupt capitalism of Tory England. But in the last seven years the Scottish Government, in fact the entire Scottish political class has adopted, by stealth, the neoliberalism that underpins Westminster politics.ldquoItrsquos all there but they disguise it better.ldquoIn all of it therersquos an absolute denial of the class-based politics thatrsquos required to improve the lives of those communities who were struggling before Holyrood was established.ldquoInstead, our Parliament has become prey to high-end lobbying firms who get invited in to influence policy and whose clients get hired as economic advisers to the Government. Yet, they want us to believe it still represents working people by handing out a few wee presents from time to time to cover the fact that itrsquos done nothing for them.Irritated AngusANGUS Robertson operates from Edinburghrsquos SNP club a few blocks away near Queen Street, opposite the National Portrait Gallery. Hersquos a warm and affable man who refuses to be anything other than polite about Bob and his other opponents in this contest. He is the embodiment of the civic nationalism his party espouses to avoid scaring the horses. He is moved to irritation only when refuting Bobrsquos accusation that hersquos a carpet-bagger with no viable connection to the city.ldquoI attended both primary and secondary schools here. I had my first job here. Are we reduced to saying you can only be from hereyou have lived your entire le in Edinburgh Here, I must declare a connection. It was while listening to Robertson address a fringe meeting in  that I was first persuaded by the case for independence. Robertson normalised it. He replaced ldquowhy with ldquowhy not  Hersquos easy to like.ldquoIf I was being generous Irsquod say that the SNPrsquos moves towards a second referendum are proceeding at a glacial pace, I tell him. ldquoSome of us think yoursquove all grown comfortable with endless devolved power.Hersquos having none of it. ldquoThe pandemic has changed everything, he replies. ldquoIt has profoundly affected the timetables of our personal lives as well as political timeframes.

For this to happen the SNP needs seats like Edinburgh Central, held only once by them in a blue-coloured generation.Therersquos another issue, barely acknowledged by Robertson, which may yet be more critical than how the Tories perform or how many supporters Bonnie Prince Bob can chivvy from the constituencyrsquos working-class neighbourhoods. This is the Joanna Cherry factor.The popular Westminster MP for neighbouring Edinburgh South had originally planned to compete with Robertson for the seat before the party intervened to make it more dficult for Westminster MPs to switch to Holyrood.

The most striking feature is the patch of white at their rump. Males are slightly smaller and pale grey with black wingtips. Both have a round, owl-like face.Hen harriers are the UK#s most persecuted bird of prey relative to its population size. Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But I think Irsquove seen lots of dferent numbers on dferent iants ndash yoursquoll appreciate, there is quite a few ndash so it is a fairly small number at the moment.

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough.

What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer. We have discussed it at a meeting and I think this could achieve better road repairs which would help road users at least in the short term.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/salmon_farmJPG-1.jpg","title":"region should be more than a playground for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhat is also very clear is that the impacts of the pandemic are extremely unequal, with the young having their prospects most severely impaired and those working in the private sector suffering the most severe economic consequences, yet to be felt in full, while the elderly and those with underlying health issues bearing the most risk to le, which has been tragic.Many people working in the front line have worked heroically. Of course, this includes those in the health service who have had to battle to save lives, but it also includes those who kept the boilers running, the ambulances and delivery vehicles on the road and the PPE arriving where required. That includes those in supply chains up and down the country, drivers, engineers, and tradesmen keeping our homes and critical facilities operational. It also includes those who have produced our food and those who distributed it and indeed those who kept the wheels and machinery of production and distribution of le’s essentials turning. Not least in the supply chain required to put food on our plates.A great many of our population, however — which is a blessing for them, whether wealthy, retired or working in the public sector or government, local or national — have neither had their economic situation nor their future employment prospects impaired, though of course, everyone has suffered the social deprivations and mental health challenges of lockdown. For those fortunate enough to be working in secure public sector employment or retired, perhaps on a secure pension, they do not have the financial concerns of those in the private sector whose jobs and livelihoods depend on viable economic activity.This imbalance of the bearing of the economic consequences of the pandemic is not given coverage or widely recognised, though our politicians at a national and local level are actively involved in formulating policy, actions, and funding programmes to sustain the economy and build back greener, better, and more fairly.Never has it been more critical for government at all levels, locally and nationally, to do everything possible to create and support sustainable jobs across our nation.We all have an obligation to recognise and understand this fundamental fact and do what we can to support economic growth and sustain people in, as well as create new jobs. The lack of a job, and the want of it, is fundamentally one of the most damaging situations to the long-term prospects, an inidual, their family and therefore society at large can suffer from.Economic growth and development,we are to sustain ourselves as a society, must be front and centre of government policy and action at national and local level. Local authorities and local politicians have a duty and an obligation too, not only to support development but make sure that they actively seek out and promote economic development opportunities within their areas of responsibility as a minimum. There needs to be some maturity in decision making and joined-up thinking in policy and action. You simply cannot have development without some impact, but neither can you have social progression without economic development.How can we call for building back our economy and protecting jobs, yet fail to support compliant job-creating planning applications  For example, the recent decision to refuse planning for an organic sea farm in Skye, which was recommended for approval, was in my view a dereliction of responsibility. It was to create nine new jobs directly. However, just the cancelling of the equipment orders required by this development and to be built here in the Highlands by our company, Gael Force Group, has caused the redundancy of over  people immediately and directly, just in this one company alone. This is a shocking narrowness in consideration and a failure of process and joined up thinking.We have become anti-development, anti-business in this country, yet we want all the benefits that depend on a strong, successful, and growing economy. It seems that we are prepared in this country now to tolerate someone dying from hunger and homelessness and the lack of a job, but not prepared to tolerate ‘our’ view or environment being altered. In the view of some people, all other forms of nature now have precedence over their fellow human beings. Like the clearances, once again the welfare of the local people who work the land and the sea is being considered as secondary to the narrow interests of a minority, often not rooted in the area, who care not for the economic wellbeing of other local people. We need to put people, their livelihoods, and their wellbeing first.The depressing familiarity of narrow interest groups’ objections to developments, often by an outspoken, sometimes fanatical, minority, often prejudiced on misinformation fuelled on social media but not supported by the scientic facts, is reaching a crisis across the Highlands and Islands and needs to be addressed. It requires local and national political leadership to speak out and stand up for the greater good, for the peoples of the Highlands and Islands welfare and livelihoods and retake the economic development agenda that has made the rural Highlands and Islands such a turnaround success over the past  to  years.If we do not see a change of behaviour in the support of development and growing the economy by all of us, we will be a failing nation, with rural areas becoming very largely inactive economically a playground for tourists, who are very welcome but who come and who go. A place again, where the will of the few suppress the opportunity of the many. If we do not change direction, we will leave no fine place, which in rural Scotland it should be, to raise a young family as our legacy.

Every day I speak with business owners who are in distress and despair and were becoming devoid of hope.

Thankfully, retail, close contact services, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses now have clear reopening dates that are signicantly better than those mooted in the media yesterday morning. They can now plan and prepare for trading again in just a few weeks# time.We welcome the Executive#s decision and the fact that Ministers have listened to and responded positively to the concerns expressed by businesses and the genuine fears they had about their futures and the jobs of their staff. We now look forward to working with departments and the council to deliver a safe reopening of our city#s economy.Simon Hamilton is chief executive of Belfast ChamberNo, says Conor BrowneI do not have a problem with outdoor activities being increased in Northern Ireland. There is no issue with outdoor table service in bars or restaurants, as long as social distancing is maintained.However, the Executive announced an indicative date for eating and drinking indoors on May .We have known for a long time in the biosecurity community that the single most dangerous place and activity that you can engage in, is groups of people inside and not wearing masks. That indicative date is a little bit too close. Whenever you release restrictions from a lockdown, you should do it in a slow manner.If you make a big change like opening close contact services and outdoor hospitality, what you want to do is wait and see what that does to the number of people who get infected with the virus and also to the number of hospital admissions.I want the economy back but my concern is thatwe move too quickly on everything, then we run the risk of infection rates spiking again and we end up going back into another lockdown of some description.I do not want to go back into another lockdown and neither does the business community but, for me, the big issue is hospitality indoors. I would like to see a little bit more time passing before we start thinking about getting people indoors.We are doing exceptionally well with our vaccination programme but the problem is there are some iants of the virus - in particular the South African iant.The vast majority of people going out will be young people, who will be unvaccinated, and could potentially lead to a spread of the South African iant in Northern Ireland.Conor Browne is a biosecurity consultant specialising in Covid- business continuity, forecasting, and analysisBelfast Most ReadChurch of Ireland reverend John Andersondies from Covid- Bad blood still lingers after republican gun murders as IRA vows revengeMournes mountain walker dies after collapsing on Slieve DonardLoyalists set to resume NI protocol protests DUP#s Alderman Bill Keery apologises for #ill-judged# Prince Philip comment during Duke of Edinburgh tribute meetingTop VideosPlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#PlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlayWatch: Sunday Le reporter takes on Megadeath XXX hot wing challengeLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  new casesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageChurch of Ireland reverend John Andersondies from Covid- Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and  new cases of Covid- Northern Ireland businesses will welcome southern customersrules are followedLatest from Belfast FedEx gunman legally bought rles despite red flag laws – US policeFootball fans speak of ‘surreal’ atmosphere at FA Cup semi-finalTV#s Dick Strawbridge and we Angel deny claims of bullying on hit C show Escape To The ChateauHome of Syrian family attacked in Newry hate crimeKelechi Iheanacho ends Leicester’s long wait for a place in the FA Cup final,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

President Higgins said educating pupils based on the their religious background is “abandoning them to parcels of hate and memory that others are manipulating”.He made the comments during an interview with RTE#s Late Late Show to mark his upcoming th birthday on Sunday.The Irish president was speaking following violence on the streets of Northern Ireland following a decision by the Public Prosecution Service not to prosecute members of Sinn Fein for their attendance at the funeral of IRA man Bobby Storey, despite coronavirus regulations.The disorder has also been linked to unionist anger around the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol, brought in to prevent a border on the island of Ireland by creating a trade border in the Irish Sea. “Who in  can justy the teaching of children separately on the basis of belief  Is it importantyou talk about an ethical present and an ambitious future that you deal with it,” President Higgins told host Ryan Tubridy.He cited social deprivation as one of the reasons for young people getting involved in the trouble and said this should have already been addressed.

Last month Seaview Primary School in Glenarm became the first Catholic primary in Northern Ireland to be approved for integrated status. The Integrated Education Fundworks to further the case for integrated education in Northern Ireland by financially supporting integrated schools and helping others to make the transition. Integrated education is often put forward as one potential long-term solution to contention around religion in the region.During his wide-ranging interview the Irish president also discussed his own experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. He said he was worried about how the general public dealt with loneliness during the lockdowns. Oh yes I have , it was one of the experiences that I really worried about, but not about myself,” he said.“I have grounds to walk in and the big dogs that I enjoy, I kept thinking as I watched television - whatyou were in a flat  Whatyou had someone who was dependent on you with special needs and you were two or three stories up, how could I begin to compare my experience with that “In Covid, some people had it harder and those people with less resources who are in circumstances where they couldn’t move about, they had it harder.”He also revealed how he was feeling ahead of his landmark birthday. I’m in two minds about it, first of all, I think age is only a concept but I#ve been very very fortunate to have the experiences that I’ve had and to have been able to meet so many people,” he said.“Why I hesitated slightly is that so many good friends of mine even in the past year have passed away and in a sense, I miss them.”Belfast Most ReadChurch of Ireland reverend John Andersondies from Covid- Bad blood still lingers after republican gun murders as IRA vows revengeMournes mountain walker dies after collapsing on Slieve DonardLoyalists set to resume NI protocol protests DUP#s Alderman Bill Keery apologises for #ill-judged# Prince Philip comment during Duke of Edinburgh tribute meetingTop VideosPlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#PlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlayWatch: Sunday Le reporter takes on Megadeath XXX hot wing challengeLatest Northern IrelandTV#s Dick Strawbridge and we Angel deny claims of bullying on hit C show Escape To The ChateauHome of Syrian family attacked in Newry hate crimeAnger after Prince Philip tribute flags stolen from Orange hallsRandox apologise to Donegal gaeltacht staff for telling them to speak English Veterans charged with killing Belfast IRA commander fear reprisalsnamed in courtLatest from Belfast FedEx gunman legally bought rles despite red flag laws – US policeFootball fans speak of ‘surreal’ atmosphere at FA Cup semi-finalTV#s Dick Strawbridge and we Angel deny claims of bullying on hit C show Escape To The ChateauHome of Syrian family attacked in Newry hate crimeKelechi Iheanacho ends Leicester’s long wait for a place in the FA Cup final,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Randox, which has headquarters in Co Antrim, said the memo from the company#s HR department was issued in error to staff in Dungloe. The company, which manufactures tests for Covid-, received financial support from Irish Government language body Udaras na Gaeltachta to establish it#s plant in the Irish speaking areaof Donegal in .The memo, first reported by Raidio na Gaeltachta, was dated April  and told all staff they should only speak in English during work. The location was blanked out.“You must be mindful that work colleagues can feel isolated and excludedyou are speaking a dferent language around them. English must be spoken at all times in the workplace, whether you are discussing work or having a casual conversation with a fellow staff member,” it said. “To facilitate effective communication between everyone within the company, locally and globally, it is essential that all staff incommunicate, both written and verbally, in English at all times. Failing to do so is not acceptable”.In a statement Randox said the communication was sent “in error and has now been withdrawn”. “Randox have been engaged in west Donegal since  and have invested signicantly in both facilities and employment, the statement read.“Randox Teoranta remain fully engaged and committed to the community of An Clochan Liath and west Donegal in general.“We work in close partnership with Udaras na Gaeltachta and are fully committed to all aspects of the Irish language and culture in our workplace and in the wider community.”Udaras na Gaeltachta, which works to develop Irish speaking areas, acknowledged the incident.“Randox have confirmed that a company communication regarding use of English within the workplace related to company operations in a dferent jurisdiction and was sent to their An Clochan Liath facility in the Donegal Gaeltacht in error, as it did not pertain to the An Clochan Liath facility, it said.“The communication was immediately withdrawn when realised.”The body said that more than €. million has been paid to Randox in capital, equipment, training, research and development supports over the past  years.“During this period Randox have invested over € million in their facility and operations in An Clochan Liath,” the body said.“In general, grant support from Udaras na Gaeltachta is conditional on client companies agreeing and implementing a company language plan that would include action items for the company to undertake including but not limited to signage, website content, language use and promotion of the language.”The matter was also raised at the Dail on Friday.

funeral.Dozens of riders, wearing black, gold and red unorms and carrying three guns, rode up to Cambridge Gate where tributes to the duke have been laid throughout the week.Members of the regiment will fire guns from the east lawn of Windsor Castle as Philip’s coffin is taken from the castle to the chapel on Saturday afternoon.Crowds grew steadily throughout Saturday morning with members of the public arriving to pay their respects to the duke.Some were seen wearing custom face masks bearing Philip’s face.Coronavirus restrictions meant fewer people were visiting the town to mark the occasion, but residents praised the royal family for “setting an example” by limiting numbers during the ongoing pandemic.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bcad .ece AUTOCROP w

Communications between Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin and the Health and Finance Ministers demonstrates that even those heading government departments have been confused about what Covid restrictions were in force and when. Localised restrictions were put in place in Derry and Strabane on October  following a surge in positive Covid cases. As part of those restrictions no indoor gatherings were permitted between people from dferent households. That specic restriction prevented barbers and hairdressers from working. In an Assembly response Health Minister Robin Swann acknowledged that fact saying close contact services were not permitted to open from October  because of the restriction on indoor gatherings. googletag.cmd.push But, he states, official regulations were only in effect between October  to November , November  to December  and those from December  are ongoing. The Localised Restrictions Support Schemeopened to businesses in Derry and Strabane council area on October , . However, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin has questioned why some of her constituents have been left unable to access support for the period between October -. She also asked Finance Minister Conor Murphy why his department is ‘recovering’ money from Derry workers who had received support. Sinead McLaughlin said: It has been dficult for businesses in Derry to understand the restrictions which govern when they were allowed to trade, and when they werent. googletag.cmd.push “What we have now learnt as a result of my questions in the Assembly to the ministers is that it has also been dficult for the departments that issue the regulations to understand them. The result is that close contact businesses such as hairdressers and barbers in Derry and Strabane which believed they were unable to trade between the th and the th October now find they are not entitled to financial support for that period from the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme, operated by minister Conor Murphy and his Department of Finance. “Some of these businesses were initially given this financial support and are now having it recovered through reductions in ongoing support payments.”     She added: The minister for health initially told me that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane were not able to trade between th and th October because of the lockdown restrictions, but that the regulations had not been in place that confirmed this. “Now a revised Assembly answer from the minister says they were able to trade between those dates. To explain six months later that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane could, after all, have traded in early October is absolutely no good at all. “I am appalled that businesses here are now suffering additional hardship because of the lack of clarity and co-operation between the health and finance departments in the setting of Covid regulations. “It is up to Conor Murphy to resolve this and I am very unhappy that, to date, he has failed to do this. The Finance Minister stands over his department’s decision saying that Covid regulations imposed by the Department of Health on October  did not require hairdressers and other close contact services to close during the period to October .

Amongst easements announced this week, there were changes to the number of people allowed to play sport outdoors. From Monday, groups of up to  people, were permitted to train and play sports together. Speaking to the Derry News, Patrick Simpson of Bay Road Soccer said the past year has been ‘tough’ mentally as well as financially. Like many businesses, uncertainty hung over every decision as lockdowns were put in place and then lted again. The ‘next generation’ outdoor soccer centre on the Bay Road reopened over the summer to the delight of service users but was forced to close a few months later. googletag.cmd.push Mr Simpson hopes lockdowns have now been resigned to the past and that people can get back to some form of normality. People of all ages use the facility for recreation. Coaches make use of the all-weather G pitches to train young football teams such as the Oxford Bulls and it hosts soccer camps during the summer. Mr Simpson said: “Every time we’ve opened there has been a great appetite for people to get back outside and to play football again. “A lot of people are saying it’s like Christmas again for them, some people are there three or four days a week. That is their hour of exercise and the hobby they enjoy.” googletag.cmd.push He added: “I hope this is the last lockdown because it really is having a detrimental affect on people’s mind when they can’t get outdoors to take part in activities that really give them a lt. “It’s about children as much as adults. “People are delighted to be back now. There’s a big smile on their faces.” Regular user of the facility, Kevin McGowan , has missed playing badly. It’s rumoured that Bay Road has a special video archive containing the Derry man’s best finishes.  Kevin, who works as a Peer Support Volunteer at ARC Fitness, is an untiring advocate of the physical and mental health benefits of playing football.     He explained: “The Bay Road to me is like meditation. Its a place where you can forget about everything  going on for an hour where its just you, your mates, two nets and a ball. “It is a great way to get rid of stress and after one session Im already reacting to things in a calmer way. “Its great to be back at it and the usual slagging has already started with the football WhatsApp group. “I forgot how much I missed that. Everything just seems easier to handle when you can have that hour away at the glorious Bay.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are smiles on the faces of the few people who are moving up and down the pavements. Approaching midday, the sun,not quite splitting the stones, is definitely causing them some discomfort. Traffic is almost constant. It comes through at a steady pace, the roar of passing lorries reverberating off Dungivens roadside shops and houses. A green and white ice cream van emblazoned with Super Mario rolls through the town. I can almost hear the theme tune in my head. googletag.cmd.push Dungiven Main Street curving down the hill. As I make my way up the hill, there is construction work going on in a few of the estates off Main Street. One man carefully removes paving stones in front of a set of flats. Further on, McReynolds Bar sits in forlorn darkness, mourning the loss of another sunny day in the beer garden. The towns other Covid-abandoned pubs would no doubt concur. The ornate gates of Gaelcholaacuteiste Dhoire are closed for Easter, but the sun illuminates the castle like a scene from a postcard. Across the street, the Kevin Lynch memorial has been spruced up, with Easter just around the corner. Political posters adorn street corners as parties jostle at the starting line ahead of next years Assembly election. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the town, traffic grinds to a halt, stled by road works that have created a narrow corridor of cones and warning signs. Heading back towards the town, I spot two people on a narrow laneway, seemingly in heated discussion. Both have puffy coats and woolly hats on, despite the strong sun, and there is a lot of finger-pointing. I decide to give them a wide berth. Passing through the town again, I notice the door to Inner Beauty is open. A glance in on the way past reveals a woman sitting cross-legged on the floor, with products strewn around her.     I have to go back. Road works at the top of the town are currently causing disruption. Claire McGill, who runs the skincare specialist salon, tells me she is preparing goodie bags to leave outside the salon for local children in place of their usual Easter celebrations. “Every Easter Saturday, we usually do an Easter egg hunt through the town, but Ive been closed since Christmas Eve,” she explains. “My customers are really running out of products now. Ive been doing deliveries, but to be honest, there is no profit in it, between time, effort and road works. “I did a delivery yesterday that was just to the top of the town and it took me over an hour. I only spoke to her for about two seconds at her front door too. Its a nightmare. “My phone hasnt stopped with people askingIm open today, because Ive had the shutter up doing this.” Claire says the latest period of lockdown has been a hard pull. Forced to seek the help of a local councillor in accessing government grant support, it still took a number of months. “I didnt get any grants because I dont have a rates bill in my name, so he got it all sorted. It took months, I only got my first one there in the middle of February, from October. ” she says. “I know everybody thinks getting pound a week when closed is fantastic, but firstly, its all taxable, so its only pound a week. “I have girls furloughed, so theres nothing left. My landlord is so decent, which is just as well, otherwise wed all be closed by now. “Were very lucky in the town that were in that everybody is very close,” she adds. Karen Groogan is looking forward to welcoming customers back in store. In an example of that close-knit community, Claire sends me across the street to meet Karen Groogan. Karen runs Groogans, a boutique clothes and fashion shop on the towns Main Street, and agrees with Claire that community support has been vital during this time. “In the run-up to Christmas, this year more than any other year, the town really got behind shopping local and it was brilliant,” she says. “Ive found this one has been harder for several dferent reasons. The weather has been a real downer and regarding shopping, I think people have been better prepared this year. “Last time I was able to help them out and ersy, selling things I wouldnt normally sell, whereas this time round, theyve had a houseful of stuff for their kids already.” Finvola keeps a watchful eye on Dungivens Main Street. As well as the dficulties associated with Covid, Karen is in two minds about the effect the new bypass will have on trade in the town. “I really dont know how its going to affect us. A lot of locals think its going to be a great thing for the town and encourage people to shop local,” she tells me. “I hope thats the way, but is there enough for them to shop local  We could really do with a good bakery, a good fruit and veg shop, but all those shops have closed because of the high rates. “Now were going to make the road to Derry even shorter. There is a feeling that when the town quietens down it will make people shop local, and I really hope thats true. “I do really well from passing trade though professional women going between Derry and Belfast for their work. They dont have the time to go shopping at the weekend and nor do they want to. “Whenever they come here, they know theyre going to get what they want. The girls that have come over the past four years know Im here, but its going to be hard to get any more girls like that. “Thats what I really worry about losing the passing trade. I really enjoy the company of them as well, so Im on the fence about whether or not it will be a good thing for the town.” Karens online trade has been good, but it doesnt replace the rapport she builds with her customers. “We do have a website, but I prefer to be open and able to sell things to people,” he says. “My shop is the kind of shop that you come in for one thing and you come out with more. Its a treasure trove. “Its got all sorts of dferent things school wear, home wear, childrens and ladies clothes, whereas it can be a bit limiting online.” The Roe sparkling in the March sun. Moving past the empty shop fronts at the bottom half of the town, your reward is the sight of the sun shimmering on the clear waters of the Roe. A young couple appear along its banks, ing from a ramble in the nearby fields. Throughout lockdown, people have rediscovered the beauty of their immediate surroundings. While the fine weather intensies dreams of normalitys , many will be hoping ambivalence to local nature spots will notwith it. In Dungiven, the community has pulled together, and they will look to harness that spirit of regeneration after Covids bitter chapter is finally drawn to a close.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The rain of the previous night has given way to a sun strong enough to elicit steam from its surface. Entering by the crossroads at the boxing club, there appear to be a lot of closed doors. A sign informs the public that Granaghan Fireplaces will be back on Monday, April . There is almost giddy optimism around the date, and by the time you read this, well be on the far bank of that particular Rubicon. Some non-essential retail will have opened, schools will be back and group training, albeit not in its full form, will have resumed. googletag.cmd.push In keeping with the general theme of this series, as soon as I gather my stuff and leave the car, the heavens open. Hailstones this time. By the time I reach the deserted play park at the bridge, it has receded to a bitter mizzle, only a stf breeze propelling it into my face. A quiet Swatragh last Friday afternoon. The Drumbane Road climbs towards the North Sperrins Scenic Route away to my right as I make my way up the hill past an empty St Johns Primary School, closed for the Easter holidays. St Johns chapel towers over the cars that pass by on the main road. That all of the gravestones seem to face in that direction only enhances the effect. googletag.cmd.push A single car sits outside the open doors of the chapel. Inside, an elderly lady has lit a candle and is praying at the foot of the altar. On the way out, she tells me Ive just missed mass. I head back towards the village. A triangular sign advertising Friels to Go sits outside the school, offering local flavour to an exploding mobile catering industry. Light snow begins to fall as I head back over the bridge. A pink Fiat brings a splash of colour to the street as grey clouds swell overhead. Outside McGuigans Garage, Kieran McGuigan says the pandemic has taken on a personal edge for him and his family.     “I had Covid myself, and so did my family, but we have all recovered. Its been a strange time. Once you get that [positive] result back, you just dont know whats in front of you.” he tells me. “Other families havent, and its been a tough time for everybody. Business-wise, were just tipping away and doing what we can. “Covid affects dferent people in dferent ways. I was off my feet, in bed for a week with the fatigue and no energy or appetite. “My we and the kids had it too, and my mother-in-law had to go into hospital with it for ten days, but thankfully shes okay now.” McGuigans garage has adapted to the restrictions as they have been introduced. Kieran pauses to wave a customer around the one-way system introduced with the onset of the pandemic. McGuigans have had to adapt like everyone . “Its all one-way and its appointment only now,” he says. “Its easier managed, you dont want too many people on the premises at the same time. Ive a routine every morning and evening where I wipe everything down. “You have your signs up, you do what you can and you bring as little people inside as possible. Were managing it and doing what we can. “The car sales will be open on Monday morning again. Vans and pick-ups have been very busy, but its going to be great to get opened up to do test drives again and meeting people face-to-face. “People enjoy the process, its part and parcel of the business. When theyre spending that amount of money, its a big step and you cant take them for granted.” Kieran admits not being able to physically meet up with friends has been tough, but says last years lockdown had a galvanising effect on the community. “There are boys I havent seen since the bars shut. Youd be texting boys, but its not the same having the craic in a WhatsApp group,” he says. “Having the banter over a beer or even getting to a football match is missed. Last year, Swatragh had five games and I was at every one of them. “The year before, I was only at a few of them, but it was just the fact you could get out, so you made a point of going to them. “The local GAA club did a lot for the community throughout the  months. They were offering to pick up groceries for people that were isolated and delivered meals. “My mum is  years of age and got it a few times, and that was done by Davitts. Its the heart of the community. Everything revolves around it and it brings everybody together.”  Sineacutead McErlean and Fran OKane from SM Filling Station on the Kilrea Road. After indulging in the glamour of being a reporter on the road and conducting a Zoom interview in the car, I head down Kilrea Road to SM Filling Station. A few minutes of to-and-fro with Sineacutead and a phone call with Sean and Im chatting to Fran OKane, who tells me the ongoing vaccination programme is lting peoples spirits. “I think people are more hopeful now because of the jab, theyre more upbeat as its been rolled out,” she says. “I have had the first one. It was a bit of a relief, but itll be better when I get the second one. Youre meeting so many people in here all the time.” The busy service station found itself with the responsibility of being essential retail, but Fran says the extra regulations quickly became part and parcel of doing business. “Its busier now again than it had been. It was very quiet early on in January but things have really picked up now and were a lot busier,” she says. “You always had that bit of nervousness and were very aware not to stand too near, or to sanitise your hands, especially with handling money and everything. “It was dficult, but as time went on it just became matter-of-fact and you just do it now every time you serve somebody. You adapt and get used to it. “Even outside, youre still inclined to pull back. Id say % of customers are wearing the masks, but you do get that odd one that doesnt wear it.” Daffodils signal Spring is well underway in Swatragh. Fran has noticed an upturn in people out walking, but is already turning her attention to more trivial matters as normality draws nearer. “I would walk the dog anyway, and you used to meet nobody out, but now youre meeting people a lot more,” she says. “Im looking forward to getting back to normal,there ever is such a thing, but Im most looking forward to getting my hair done. “I need a trim and a colour done,” she adds. The stay at home message has now officially been discontinued by the NI Executive, but it has been moot for weeks. Ato group training will come as a welcomed relief to sportspeople throughout the county, and summer feels a lot closer now than it did last week. At the weekend, the Department of Health announced over one million vaccines had been administered, between first and second doses. As Kieran McGuigan shows customers around the garage courtyard this week, Swatragh will be one small step closer to the end of the pandemic. It might feel like one giant leap.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The rain of the previous night has given way to a sun strong enough to elicit steam from its surface. Entering by the crossroads at the boxing club, there appear to be a lot of closed doors. A sign informs the public that Granaghan Fireplaces will be back on Monday, April . There is almost giddy optimism around the date, and by the time you read this, well be on the far bank of that particular Rubicon. Some non-essential retail will have opened, schools will be back and group training, albeit not in its full form, will have resumed. googletag.cmd.push In keeping with the general theme of this series, as soon as I gather my stuff and leave the car, the heavens open. Hailstones this time. By the time I reach the deserted play park at the bridge, it has receded to a bitter mizzle, only a stf breeze propelling it into my face. A quiet Swatragh last Friday afternoon. The Drumbane Road climbs towards the North Sperrins Scenic Route away to my right as I make my way up the hill past an empty St Johns Primary School, closed for the Easter holidays. St Johns chapel towers over the cars that pass by on the main road. That all of the gravestones seem to face in that direction only enhances the effect. googletag.cmd.push A single car sits outside the open doors of the chapel. Inside, an elderly lady has lit a candle and is praying at the foot of the altar. On the way out, she tells me Ive just missed mass. I head back towards the village. A triangular sign advertising Friels to Go sits outside the school, offering local flavour to an exploding mobile catering industry. Light snow begins to fall as I head back over the bridge. A pink Fiat brings a splash of colour to the street as grey clouds swell overhead. Outside McGuigans Garage, Kieran McGuigan says the pandemic has taken on a personal edge for him and his family.     “I had Covid myself, and so did my family, but we have all recovered. Its been a strange time. Once you get that [positive] result back, you just dont know whats in front of you.” he tells me. “Other families havent, and its been a tough time for everybody. Business-wise, were just tipping away and doing what we can. “Covid affects dferent people in dferent ways. I was off my feet, in bed for a week with the fatigue and no energy or appetite. “My we and the kids had it too, and my mother-in-law had to go into hospital with it for ten days, but thankfully shes okay now.” McGuigans garage has adapted to the restrictions as they have been introduced. Kieran pauses to wave a customer around the one-way system introduced with the onset of the pandemic. McGuigans have had to adapt like everyone . “Its all one-way and its appointment only now,” he says. “Its easier managed, you dont want too many people on the premises at the same time. Ive a routine every morning and evening where I wipe everything down. “You have your signs up, you do what you can and you bring as little people inside as possible. Were managing it and doing what we can. “The car sales will be open on Monday morning again. Vans and pick-ups have been very busy, but its going to be great to get opened up to do test drives again and meeting people face-to-face. “People enjoy the process, its part and parcel of the business. When theyre spending that amount of money, its a big step and you cant take them for granted.” Kieran admits not being able to physically meet up with friends has been tough, but says last years lockdown had a galvanising effect on the community. “There are boys I havent seen since the bars shut. Youd be texting boys, but its not the same having the craic in a WhatsApp group,” he says. “Having the banter over a beer or even getting to a football match is missed. Last year, Swatragh had five games and I was at every one of them. “The year before, I was only at a few of them, but it was just the fact you could get out, so you made a point of going to them. “The local GAA club did a lot for the community throughout the  months. They were offering to pick up groceries for people that were isolated and delivered meals. “My mum is  years of age and got it a few times, and that was done by Davitts. Its the heart of the community. Everything revolves around it and it brings everybody together.”  Sineacutead McErlean and Fran OKane from SM Filling Station on the Kilrea Road. After indulging in the glamour of being a reporter on the road and conducting a Zoom interview in the car, I head down Kilrea Road to SM Filling Station. A few minutes of to-and-fro with Sineacutead and a phone call with Sean and Im chatting to Fran OKane, who tells me the ongoing vaccination programme is lting peoples spirits. “I think people are more hopeful now because of the jab, theyre more upbeat as its been rolled out,” she says. “I have had the first one. It was a bit of a relief, but itll be better when I get the second one. Youre meeting so many people in here all the time.” The busy service station found itself with the responsibility of being essential retail, but Fran says the extra regulations quickly became part and parcel of doing business. “Its busier now again than it had been. It was very quiet early on in January but things have really picked up now and were a lot busier,” she says. “You always had that bit of nervousness and were very aware not to stand too near, or to sanitise your hands, especially with handling money and everything. “It was dficult, but as time went on it just became matter-of-fact and you just do it now every time you serve somebody. You adapt and get used to it. “Even outside, youre still inclined to pull back. Id say % of customers are wearing the masks, but you do get that odd one that doesnt wear it.” Daffodils signal Spring is well underway in Swatragh. Fran has noticed an upturn in people out walking, but is already turning her attention to more trivial matters as normality draws nearer. “I would walk the dog anyway, and you used to meet nobody out, but now youre meeting people a lot more,” she says. “Im looking forward to getting back to normal,there ever is such a thing, but Im most looking forward to getting my hair done. “I need a trim and a colour done,” she adds. The stay at home message has now officially been discontinued by the NI Executive, but it has been moot for weeks. Ato group training will come as a welcomed relief to sportspeople throughout the county, and summer feels a lot closer now than it did last week. At the weekend, the Department of Health announced over one million vaccines had been administered, between first and second doses. As Kieran McGuigan shows customers around the garage courtyard this week, Swatragh will be one small step closer to the end of the pandemic. It might feel like one giant leap.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Planning permission was this week granted for the conversion of the former Officers Mess building at Ebrington, known as Building , into offices. However, SDLP councillor John Boyle questioned whether offices were the best use for the fascinating building which was built in . Planning permission was also granted at a meeting this week of Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee on Monday for another historic building on the Ebrington site base to be turned into office accommodation. googletag.cmd.push The former guard house building, known at Building , will be remodelled and extended. The works will provide new office accommodation incorporating meeting rooms and other associated facilities. Building  is a Grade  listed building, located along the southern side ofEbringtonSquare. Building  will undergo internal alterations with the addition of a lt shaft and a flat roof extension, transforming the building into a modern office space. Cllr Boyle told the meeting that he supported planning permission being granted for the respective plans for the two Ebrington buildings. However, in relation to Building , he said he believed the building could have been put to better use. googletag.cmd.push “Sometimes I do consider that buildings like this as office space, perhaps that is not the ideal use,” he said. “I actually know this building and some years ago a friend of mine was carrying out some remediation work inside it and I happened to call over and have a look around it. “It is a fascinating building, it really is a first class quality building and I just regret a little more imagination around what this building could have been used for has not been applied in this particular instance. “But office space can be useful and provides for employment opportunities and jobs and progression of local people and the economy here locally but we are where we are.     “I am also conscious of the fact that something can obviously then be reconverted back into something  as well.” Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson, chair of the councils Planning Committee, said he could understand Cllr Boyles comments in relation to a perceived lack of imagination. However, Cllr Jackson said many of the Ebrington buildings had been unoccupied for too long and he said the new office accommodation was a major step for the site. “We are starting to see businesses whatever their nature having the confidence to invest in Ebrington Square and relocating to Ebrington Square and inevitably it will lead to an increased footfall and along with that we hope to see the real ambition for Ebrington Square fulfilled.” In response, Cllr Boyle agreed that many of the Ebrington buildings had been unoccupied for too long and he welcomed the new plans for the Building  and Building . This weeks meeting was told that a local company, GLA Surveyors, had indicated that they plan to move into Building . A planning officer told this weeks meeting that he did not knowthere were prospective tenants for Building . Cllr Jackson said he was delighted to see work continue to progress at the site. This is just the latest step in the complete transformation of the site atEbringtonSquare and the journey towards achieving its potential as a hugely important business and cultural hub for the city. “The site is unique in bringing together both Derrys past and future stories.

The upgrade of the Buncrana Road was first mooted some  years ago. Hopes that work would commence in the near future rose this week after it emerged that traffic lights are to be erected at the Springtown Road junction of Buncrana Road. However, Dfi has quashed those hopes by stating the new lights were being put in place to facilitate an expectant increase in traffic due to the construction of a new Lidl supermarket due to open in  weeks time. googletag.cmd.push In a statement to the Derry News, a Dfi spokesperson said: “Planning permission was granted for a new Lidl store on the Buncrana Road which includes for the upgrade of the Springtown Road Buncrana Road junction to a signal controlled junction prior to the opening of the new store. “This measure is to assist the mitigation of the impact of traffic generated by the new retail outlet in the interests of road safety and traffic progression and will incorporate a pedestrian phase.” The spokesperson added: “In June , Minster Mallon announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of Strategic Road Improvement schemes including the A Buncrana Road, as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation while addressing regional imbalance. googletag.cmd.push “Consistent with wider priorities, Minister Mallon is committed to ensuring that this scheme is future-proofed to help stimulate green recovery. “The Department is continuing to progress the A Buncrana Road scheme in line with the objectives which include improving transport links, road safety, traffic progression and contributing to the regeneration of the area. The spokesperson concluded: “Officials will continue discussions with all affected landowners and other stakeholders over the coming months and to progress scheme development.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said it was vitally important the upgrade took place as soon as possible. “The full upgrade of this road is crucial to ensure that it is fit for purpose as a main gateway into our Donegal hinterland and feature in any future expansion of the Fort George site.     “And it is also vitally important to make sure that happens as soon as possible for all the residents and businesses along its entirety as it’s estimated that over , vehicles use itdaily.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Offices of Mid Ulster District Council in Cookstown were vandalised in the attack, with the words Fly the Flag spray painted on the wall. The grafitti is thought to be in reference to an earlier decision by the council to reject a motion calling for the Union flag to be flown at half-mast to mark the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh. DUP leader on the council, Paul McLean had called on council Chair Cathal Mallaghan to explain to Mid Ulsters constituents why the flag would not be flown. googletag.cmd.push We requested that the Union Flag be flown at half-mast to mark the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh but the Council Chairman has declined that request, he said. We disagree with the decision and have requisitioned a meeting for the Chairman to explain to those in Mid Ulster who want to show their respect for the Duke of Edinburgh why this position has been taken. The chairman has seven days to grant the meeting.Unionists may only make up  of the  members but we have a right to be heard and to receive an explanation. It is extraordinary that the Sinn Fein Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly can have the Union Flag flying at half-mast on Parliament Buildings but here in Michelle O’Neill’s constituency another Sinn Fein councillor has refused to fly the Union Flag at half-mast as a mark of respect.” googletag.cmd.push Council Chair Cathal Mallaghan condemned the grafitti, saying it was completely unacceptable. These are civic offices where we our residents come to register births, deaths, marriages, he said. Its where we provide crucial public services, from building control to economic development and from where we also operate our local bin collection services. “To see the offices defaced in this way is completely unacceptable. This should be a safe, shared space for our residents and for our staff and such vandalism is an attack on local public services, as well as local democracy. “I condemn it and I call on all elected representatives to do likewise”.     SDLP councillor Malachy Quinn said the vandalism was pathetic. MUDC has since the very start held a no flags policy to stop them becoming an issue, he said. All our staff have the right to come to work free from harassment and will continue to make that the case. Sadly we have sad inidulas who are out their trying to whip up sectarian hatred through defacing public buildings, violence on our streets and wrecking their own towns and trying to drag a new generation down with them. They wont succeed. John Hume always said You cant eat a flag and unionism should take heed and tackle the real issues in our society instead of talking flags.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After  years in Asia,  of which have been in Thailand, John is now nearing  years of age and is finally taking a step back from an adulthood that has revolved wholeheartedly around the growth of gaelic football in Bangkok and beyond. The magnitude of the Asian GAA community cannot be underestimated. The Asian Games are massive in this part of the world, with over  teams involved – men and women, and over  people coming together in friendship and competition. There are  clubs in Asia and the popularity of the sport, amongst Irish exiles and locals is growing year on year. googletag.cmd.push At the heart of this growth was, and is, Derry native John who founded Thailand GAA in . Since then, John has slowly but surely built something lasting, ever since agreeing to a request from the Asian County Board to set up a gaelic football team in Thailand. That set in motion a chain of events that has resulted in a thriving club – Thai GAA – but also a gaelic community that extends far beyond the limitations of the game itself. With three South Asia Championships to their name, Thai GAA is not just there to make up the numbers – it has ambition, not just for growth, but for success, and winning the men’s section of the Asian Gaelic Games remains the ultimate goal. googletag.cmd.push It is a far cry from kicking a ball about with Oxford United back in the late s. “I would never have thought  years ago when I was in Derry that I would end up in Thailand,” John admits. “I had one of those fork in the road moments. I was working for two years in England and was itching to get back home. I wasn’t that satisfied with my career and wanted to do something dferent. It was in July ’ that my boss rang me and asked ‘How do you fancy going to Thailand next week ’. The very same day I got a job offer back in Derry. I thoughtThailand didn’t happen, I would take the job in Derry. A week later I was in Thailand. That taste in travel, it opens your eyes to the world and I have never looked back.”     John left St. Columb’s in  and was accepted into Loughborough University for a degree in Chemical Engineering. Loughborough’s fine sporting pedigree was a key factor behind his choice but that side of it didn’t work out as he hoped and it wasn’t until his final year that he kicked a ball regularly again. He started playing gaelic – not his strong suit – in Leicester, before moving to Reading where there was a strong Irish community, and plenty in the way of soccer and gaelic. His job took him all around the world, but a trip to Taiwan in  ultimately changed his path and his le, completely. Now married to Jessie, with children Shannen, Cara and Caolan, John remembers when he discovered just how popular gaelic was in Asia. “I went to Taiwan in  on a project and discovered gaelic football team there,” he recalls. “They were competing in Asian Gaelic Games. It was just amazing to see  Irish people playing Gaelic football in China. “I had the opportunity to meet with Micheal OMuircheartaigh who was the honorary President of the Asian County Board. He comes over year and commentates on the games pitch-side. I didn’t watch a lot of gaelic growing up but I always watched the All-Ireland final. His voice was legendary and to actually meet the guy and have dinner with him and get to know him, was inspiring. “I ed to Thailand in , the County Board asked Johnhe could set up a team in Thailand. I managed to get a few Irish people and a few non-Irish people together and we got a team together and we played in our first Asian Games in Singapore in . In our first match we were lined up against Singapore Rugby team and I was in midfield and was lined up against a guy called Phil Green, who used to be a hooker for the England rugby team. “That was our first participation as Thailand GAA. Since then, every year, except , we have entered a team into the Asian Gaelic Games.”  Responsibility For a man who preferred soccer, and even a bit of golf, John was suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, and, admittedly stubborn, he was not about to give his new role anything other than %. It was not easy however, and a lot of dficult days passed for a club which started out with five showing up for training to a club and city which has now hosted the Asian Games on three occasions, in ,  and  as well as hosting the South Asia Games on four occasions. “It was very dficult to be honest,” he admits. “The first thing I did was put an ad in the Bangkok Post and I got maybe four or five replies. The first training session had four or five people with a few girlfriends watching on. Because of my background with Oxford United, fitness came first so I told the guys they wouldn’t see a ball until they were fit, and I think because they had a dferent background from me, they thought this wasn’t for them. I probably scared people away. “Near tournaments it’s easy to get people to commit, but during the year and you’re running training once a week – I have a -hour commute to get out to training – you’re not sure what numbers you’re going to get. It’s very frustrating and the number of times I questioned myself ‘Why am I doing this ’ It was dficult, but I’m quite stubborn as well, and when I start something, it takes a lot for me to drop it because I want to make it a success. I persevered and I persevered and in  it really started changing.” The foundations of Thai GAA really started to take hold thanks to a talented group of girls, who came to the club, not just wanting to play, but to compete at the highest level. As defining moments go, this was signicant for John and his hopes of what Thai GAA could ultimately be. “I got a batch of girls in who were all natural athletes,” he explains. “Only two of them were Irish, one from the North and one from the South and neither of them had played gaelic before. One of them had played soccer for Northern Ireland but had no background in gaelic football. I had this group of girls for six weeks – all teachers from international schools before the  Asian Games in Malaysia, trying to get the basics. “In the first games they were asking ‘Where do I stand  Where do I go ’ They won six out of six at that tournament and won their ision. That was unbelievable success. Their hardest game was actually the semi-final against the Japanese Ladies. We beat them on Sudden Death Golden Goal. The same bunch of girls came back the next year in  and they won their title again that year. The following year they lost in the Upper Division, but that set the basis. This group of girls was committed, they loved their sport and we were giving them an opening to play competitively. “ was when we really bedded in as a club and that was on the back of our girls’ team. In , my girls won the South Asia Championship, so that was a regional tournament involving Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Shanghai. That was quite an achievement.”  Sustained success On the back of the girls’ success, the club got this influx of Irish men in  and that has since helped sustain the club over the last  years. The first men’s trophy soon followed – the Plate at the South Asia Games, and from there the club has gone from strength to strength. Better quality players joined – some with county experience, and fresh ideas and new energy began running through Thai GAA. “I was trying to remember things I learned playing with Doire Colmcille  or  years ago, but then these guys come in with fresh ideas and I was happy to let them coach,” John laughs. “The club is in a really strong place right now. We probably have about  members. What’s important is that there is a really good social side to the club as well. Most of the players would be late ’s, and early to late s, but there is room for everyone and it’s just a home away from home for a lot of people. It’s a good social network as well and you’re giving people a chance to play competitive sport as well as keeping fit. “Something I’ve picked up from the last  years of playing gaelic in Asia is what gaelic football means to people as a community. Most major cities in Asia have a gaelic team and it really is a home away from home from Irish and Northern Irish people, and people from both sides of the community in Ireland.” Only recently, John gave up the Chairmanship at the club, as he finally takes a back step from the day to day running of Thai GAA. It has been a labour of passion for the Carnhill man for  years, and he is proud of what it has become. He is not about to drt away into the sunset however. He might be turning  but he wants to keep playing, and doing whatever he can to ensure longevity and success for the club in the future. “I am very proud of what we’ve achieved in Thailand,” he says. “It’s also helped me stay connected to Ireland to be honest. This connection with gaelic football has given me more of an identity and a connection with Ireland being overseas. I have been able to meet a lot of people through gaelic football. The GAA certainly connects people and you can see the impact it has overseas. “I’m realizing that Father Time is marching on. I still want to be involved with the club, but I have work and family commitments. I used to be very heavily involved in making all the decisions but I have got a good bunch of people in there now who can share the load. “The next tournament maybe in Bangkok next year as it will host the South Asia Games and then at the end of  for the Asia Games, so maybe I can have a final swansong at those. There are guys older than me still playing so there’s a level for everyone. I’ll still be involved.”  Home away from home John s to Derry every summer with his family but for now, and for the past  years, his real home has been over , miles away, where he has helped build not just a team, but a club, a community and a legacy that will last long into the future. “It makes you realise the world is a small place and that the opportunities are out there,” he reflects. “It wasn’t something I sought out. I am proud of what I have achieved and what the club has achieved, but there has been a lot of good work that other people have done out in Asia around gaelic football. “It’s not just about gaelic football, it’s about Irish people and how we fit in around the world. We have no real baggage, we are able to adapt and fit into the communities we find ourselves in, and make a positive impact with our culture and with the welcome that we can bring to other people. When you are a teenager you have no idea where the future is going to take you. I had no great expectations or any great career plan. It was all by chance and by opportunity and here I am, sitting in Thailand.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes are one of just two teams without a victory so far this season, with Tuesday night’s - defeat to Shamrock Rovers the latest disappointment for Declan Devine and his players. There is now signicant pressure on City to get a result against Drogheda United at the Brandywell tonight to avoid the club’s worst start in their League of Ireland history. Victory however, could see them climb a few places, and Coll believes that a win would be huge for the club in a number of aspects. googletag.cmd.push “There’s a wee bit of pressure coming into it,” he admitted. “It’s not nice coming into a game under pressure so we have to try and take it away, and, on our home patch, start making it our patch. There are a few faces looking over the walls looking in watching us and we have to put a smile on their faces again. Hopefully Drogheda comes thick and fast and we can get the three points and get up and running.” Despite the defeat to Rovers, Coll saw a number of positives, particularly the performances of youngsters Ronan Boyce and Brendan Barr, who started Tuesday’s game. In all, six players who came through the Academy represented the club against the champions. googletag.cmd.push “They deserve their minutes,” he said. “If you look at Caoimhim Porter coming on, and Ronan Boyce, Brendan Barr, Caolan McLaughlin and Dixie Ferry, these players deserve their chance, because in pre-season they have stepped up to the mark and they know that Declan, Paddy, Conor and Mark will give them a chance. That’s exactly what they’ve done and hopefully they can keep driving on. “It’s hard to take and it’s four from four but there were some positives from the game. We conceded two disappointing goals, butyou look, we had Brendan Barr coming into the team and Ronan Boyce, and then the other young lads who came in. They were all brilliant and they are a credit to themselves. They were very good but the rest of the team have to step up to the same mark they are trying to reach.”     ‘Stick with us’ Coll has urged the fans not to fret despite the poor start to the season, promising that the players will turn it around soon. City have home games against Drogheda and Dundalk coming up in the next five days and a goodof points could change everything according to the experienced full-back. “Don’t be panicking too much because it’s a long season and we’re only four games in,” he insisted. “We have experience in this team look at Will Patching and Eoin Toal and others, we will be able to turn this around. Hopefully that’s on Friday night. We just have to regroup and that’s what we have to do. It’s our job. Tonight is another game so hopefully we can turn it around.” “You see the boys coming in after games and there’s nearly tears in their eyes. It’s not that we’re used to winning every single game or anything like that. Shamrock Rovers haven’t lost a game in the last year. We just want to get three points on the board and get off the bottom of the table because this club does not belong where we’re at, at the minute.” Defender Danny Lupano is set tofrom suspension after missing the Shamrock Rovers game due to his red card at St. Patrick’s Athletic last week, while Darren Cole should be fit after a recent injury.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is imperative that this report is published and consulted upon so that we can see the stark reality of what key strategists in health here are thinking.ldquoAre we to take the threat of having the Downe and Daisy Hill in Newry reduced to dferent grades of urgent care centres  If we are, then we need to maintain solidarity as a district and not allow this to happento either of our two beloved hospitals.Cllr Savage said the local authority could not get into a ldquoide and conquer approach that saw ldquoone end of the district get more crumbs from the health service table than the other.ldquoWe need to fight to protect and enhance the services at both hospitals. We want services retained and enhanced for our people, he said.The Newry councillor pointed to the -year community campaign for a new Downe Hospital, suggesting that since its foundation stone was laid ldquoit has been a constant battle to retain services, commending the Down Community Health Committee for its work in fighting to retain local services.ldquoWe in this district should not have to constantly look over our shoulder in fear of the centralising grim reapers within the Department of Health attempting to swing the axe again at our cherished local hospitals to enhance services within a cluster of hospitals within the greater Belfast area, declared Cllr Savage.ldquoElected representatives have an obligation to speak up for our people and ensure that we are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to access to local hospital services and first class health care.ldquoThe Department of Health should be looking to enhance local hospitals and a strategy needs to be looked at regionally with the emphasis on fair access to local health services.Highlighting the need to fight to protect the health rights of rural communities across the district, Cllr Savage called for a ldquofair share of specialist services across all hospitals, suggesting thatthe Downe is good enough to provide cataract surgery, it is good enough to provide other services.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to look at the challenges we face in health and ask ourselves are the current engagement structures we have capable of holding decision makers within health to account into the future and could they withstand the body blow of a potential decision to halve the number of current hospitals ldquoWe need to review those structures and a good place to start would be enhanced engagement with the Down Community Health Committee and Daisy Hill Pathfinder Group, inviting these groups to meet with us to discuss their concerns for the future of our local hospitals in a post-Covid world.Cllr Savage said local people required an ldquounequivocal statement from the health minister that there are no plans to reduce the number of hospitals and a ldquocast iron guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Downe HospitalHe added: Only when we get a response will we know  the rumours are just rumours. If itrsquos the latter, ever member of the chamber and everyone across this district will be up for that fight..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Church.jpg","title":"Church delivers huge food donation  ","story":"THE Journey Church in Downpatrick has been working to distribute more than pound, worth of food supplies to ious food banks across the district.Over a seven-week period, dozens of volunteers worked to ensure that food has been delivered to organisations which get the supplies to families and iniduals who need it most.Itrsquos the latest wave of the local effort from Newry, Mourne and Down Council with funding from the Department for Communitiesto get practical help to families economically affected by the pandemic.From March last year, local groups quickly responded to distribute food parcels to any household in need. The post-Christmas lockdown presented yet another challenge to the council and the DfC to target help where it was most needed.The County Down Rural Community Network , Newry Confederation of Community groups and others were asked to set up three brand new distribution centres and allocated over pound, worth of food and essential hygiene and household goods to the area.The Journey Church stepped up to assist in the Downpatrick area and week after week, dozens of their volunteers received the supplies from Lynas Foods, which they made into the ious orders and dispatching them to the ious groups in need. Down Community Transport helped with the bulkier loads.The Clanrye Group were tasked with coordinating the scheme and Kilkeel Development Association looked after the Mournes area. Clanrye collated orders for food and supplies each week and Lynas foods delivered pallets of supplies to this part of the world.Orders were placed each week by local food banks, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Home-Start, Sure Start and other organisations.Nicholas McCrickard, manager of CDRCN, said: ldquoOn behalf of the strategic stakeholder forum, I want to thank Journey Church and all the other groups involved in this gigantic effort.ldquoThe general public may never fully grasp the scale of the operation to keep our foodbanks and SVP stocked and able to answer the great need which has been brought on by the pandemic.ldquoWhile many of us have seen our lives as relatively unaffected, thousands of people have seen their normal weekly incomes and their day to day struggles take a turn for the worse.ldquoThis food pallet scheme and other financial and food security systems have been a leline for many. I want to thank the Maria Keenan from the Clanrye Group in particular and my colleague Daniella McCarry for going well beyond their normal jobs to help people most in need.Daniella said: ldquoWe could not have done this without the volunteers from the Journey Church in Downpatrick. They selflessly gave up days of their own time and rallied to the warehouse to get the vital supplies out to those that needed it most.ldquoThe foodbanks, SVP and our other partners are also to be commended for getting their orders in every week and for getting food and nappies and other products quickly out to local families.Thomas Leavy, from the Journey Churchrsquos leadership team, was the person who co-ordinated the local effort.He said that the church volunteers represented all generations distributed food to Downpatrickrsquos Fountain food bank, St Vincent De Paul in Strangford and Killough, Newcastle and Ballynahinch food bank.ldquoThis is the second time we have partnered with County Down Rural Community Network, he explained.ldquoIn the first lockdown we delivered food parcels, this time we delivered straight to agencies so that they could get the supplies out.ldquoDown Community Transport assisted with the use of several of their buses to deliver supplies furthest away while we did more local deliveries.The church hired the former Down Sports Centre premises in order to have room to break down the thousands of pounds worth of food which came each week on pallets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Backing.jpg","title":"Council backing ban on conversion therapy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has called for a ban on so-called conversion therapy and increased protection for those in the LGBT+ community.The decision was taken at last weekrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority with the debate including a powerful and moving contribution from Slieve Gullion councillor Pete Byrne, who highlighted the issues that those in the gay community like himself face.Tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown, the motion was not agreed unanimously, with Independent Unionist Henry Reilly voting against it on the grounds that he did not know enough about the issue to make a judgement. The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen abstained.Cllr Brown urged the local authority to oppose the harm caused to the LGBT+ community in the past through the denial of rights and equal treatment and to recognise that discrimination still occurs today.Councillors have also supported a call to three Stormont ministers mdash Deirdre Hargey, Robin Swann and Naomi Long mdash to introduce an effective ban on conversion therapy within Northern Ireland, supported by a programme of work to help tackle these practices in all their forms.Cllr Brownrsquos motion, which urged the NI Executive and UK government to ban conversion therapy, called on the council to highlight and promote the continued support, counselling and advocacy local groups provide to members of the LGBT+ community.ldquoConversion therapy is a horric practice that has no place in todayrsquos society, Cllr Brown declared.ldquoConversion therapy is a term used to refer to ious dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoThat could include attempting to change someonersquos sexual orientation from lesbian, gay or bisexual to straight or their gender identity from transgender or non-binary to cisgender.Cllr Brown said this disgraceful practice should not be accepted and permanently banned through legislation.Cllr Byrne mdash who is the SDLP group leader mdash said the fact that the issue was being debated in  was ldquobeyond distressing and as conversion therapy was still openly being practised.ldquoWe canrsquot look at the LGBT community and ask us to speak about it without your support, he told colleagues. ldquoWe need everyone in the chamber to support it and I hope they do.ldquoWe have heard the disappointing and weak response from the equalities minister on the conversion therapy debate in early March and we have waited almost , days since the UK government announced its intention to ban this therapy and we should not have to wait any longer.ldquoItrsquos long past time that the NI Executive stood up together to ban what I think are abusive practices in Northern Ireland and right across the UK, banning all interventions that have the intention of changing, suppressing, converting or cancelling sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.Cllr Byrne said that growing up as gay, he found it incredibly dficult, explaining to his colleagues that he could not express how dficult it had been.ldquoMentally, you torture yourself, you question yourself and you close down, block out your feelings. You literally wear a mask every single day, praying that you donrsquot say something that will give you away.ldquoYou endure enough mental anguish to last a dozen letimes so, to me, when I look back, that is you internally practising a form of conversion therapy on yourself. It is shameful, but that is how you feel growing up, suppressing your own sexual orientation and every LGBT+ person knows the damage that it does, he said, emphasising that allowing conversion therapy to be practised openly or signposting people towards it is ldquobeyond depressing.Cllr Byrne said for most of those in the gay community they ldquogenerally breathe for the first time when they let it all out and to be true to yourself, explaining that the dficulties do not stop there.ldquoYou are confronted as a gay person by many situations that challenge you mentally and while people say lsquothat is the cross you have to bearrsquo it should not be, he continued. ldquoThere is nothing about my sexuality that needs fixed, nothing about it that needs intervention.Cllr Cathy Mason, who seconded the motion, said the practice of conversion therapy sought to ldquodenormalise or completely eradicate a personrsquos sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression and was deeply rooted in ldquointolerance and bigotry.She said those who conducted the therapy regularly exploited the vulnerabilities of young people struggling with their sexuality.She described conversion therapy as a ldquodeeply harmful and regressive practice and that there must be no loopholes on the legislation governing it.Cllr Hanna said the DUP would abstain on the motion, making it clear he had no problems with anyone and takes everyone as he finds them and that conversion therapy was ldquosomething that he would not wish on anyone.Cllr Willie Clarke said no one had the right to question another personrsquos sexuality, while Cllr Reilly askedpeople were ldquoforced into conversion therapy, explaining that he did not know about the issue.However, he suggested that to ban something because ldquoyou did not like a personrsquos ideology or philosophy was the start of a dark path.He said there was a wider context to the issue and that he had a lot of respect for Cllr Byrne.

I thought he did it excellently, he had such short time but he had the room laughing and I think everyone really appreciated it.While Mr Lindsay also met him at St Jamesrsquo Palace in London, it was another Hillsborough Castle event that Prince Philip shared his robust opinion.ldquoThere was only the one time that I talked to him for about two minutes at Hillsborough gates and there was a statue there that he didnrsquot think very much of and he told me, which was quite funny, recalled Mr Lindsay.ldquoI was once lucky enough to have a short private conversation with the Queen but that was all I managed with the Duke unfortunately.Mr Lindsay commended the Duke for the positive impact and benefit his award scheme had on young people.ldquoI do strongly support the Duke of Edinburghrsquos Award scheme, as I support all groups who help develop and support young people, said Mr Lindsay. ldquoThere is no doubt about it, these groups who help young people make a huge dference as to how people develop as adult and help keep the more vulnerable children away from undesirable habits.ldquoI take my hat off to him being behind a scheme which has been an outstanding success and copied around the world as well.He revealed that previous plans for the aftermath of the Dukersquos death had advised there were to be no memorial services for  days after his death which subsequently had been changed to  days.Mr Lindsay said: ldquoAll along the Duke said that he did not want any particular arrangements and I agree.

Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock.

In October, firefighters fought to bring a malicious blaze under control.They were back at the plant last Saturday just before pm following reports of a fire in an industrial skip which spread to a nearby metal container.Fire crews from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch brought the blaze under control within an hour of the alarm being raised.The fire at the waste oil plant came at the end of three nights of sporadic trouble in the area, with fires started in the middle of the Killough Road which straddles the Model Farm and Flying Horse estates and missiles fired at cars.It is also understood that police on patrol in the area came across a pile of breeze blocks which were removed, fearing they would have been used as missiles to target passing cars.Cllr John Trainor mdash who was a passenger in a car targeted by petrol bombers late on Saturday night mdash has called for an end to the violence, which, he said, is being perpetrated by teenagers hellbent on causing misery for others.He believes that a partnership approach involving the local community, statutory agencies and the police is vital in getting on top of an issue which has resulted in a number of residents living in fear and others afraid to venture out at night.Just before .pm last Saturday, Cllr Trainor was approaching the Model Farm junction when a petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle by a crowd of up to eight teenagers which included girls and boys. While the missile missed the car, it smashed on the main road and exploded.ldquoA fire had been lit on the main road and there is just no sense to this kind of activity, he declared.ldquoWhatan elderly driver had been confronted by a petrol bomb thrown at them and lost control of their vehicle  I have no doubt that last weekrsquos trouble was cleary pre-meditated.ldquoYou just donrsquot turn up at a housing area and discover petrol bombs. While what happened was clearly planned, it is not reflective of the hard working local people in the area.Cllr Trainor said there was ldquono sense to this kind of activity and questioned how the teenagers were able to get their hands on petrol bombs.He said there had been trouble at the Killough Road some years ago and that a targeted approach involving local groups and statutory agencies had made an impact.ldquoI think we need to go back to this model and there must be community buy-in. It is clear we are talking about a long term commitment as this continued trouble needs to stop. People have had enough and want to be able to live their lives free from the threat of trouble and violence, continued Cllr Trainor.ldquoWe need a strategy and action plan in tandem with an effective policing policy to deal with this issue and a pledge from partner agencies that they will make a long-term commitment. A partnership approach is vital moving forward and must include the local community.Admitting that he was not shocked nor surprised by the petrol bomb attack, Cllr Trainor said what happened could potentially have had ldquocatastrophic consequences with the behaviour witnessed over the past number of days at the Killough Road area nothing knew, insisting that it is in no way reflective of of the people who live locally.ldquoWe have a situation where people are not happy and a number are living in fear. Numerous scenarios could potentially have played out last weekend and I am thankful that they didnrsquot. The the fire in the road, the arson attack at the waste oil plant and the petrol bomb incident will be roundly condemned and rightly so. But they must not be allowed to continue, that is why a strategy to deal with the issue involving all stakeholders is vital.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoWe simply cannot have a situation where violence is prevalent in a part of Downpatrick where people are trying to get on with their lives. They do not need this. Throwing petrol bombs is not entertainment, it is criminality. Anti-social behaviour is often a symptom of other issues in peoplersquos lives which have to be tackled.Agreeing that the recent trouble is not reflective of the wider community, Cllr Oonagh Hanlon revealed that she witnessed some of the incidents including the malicious fires.She said it appeared that the blaze at the Macwaste plant was started deliberately and was ldquoextremely concerning given that the business was targeted last October.ldquoConsidering the highly flammable material stored at the Brannish Road site, it is a miracle that no one was seriously injured, she declared.ldquoCredit to our local firefighters who ensured that the fire did not spread. It is extremely frustrating that emergency services are being distracted from what could be more serious incidents and emergencies.

It was clear that while he had a full diary given his role as the Queenrsquos consort, he was way ahead of his time when it came to environmental, wildle and conservation issues.Terry said the television coverage of the Princersquos le, which ended just a few short months short of his th birthday, brought many memories of his own family flooding back.ldquoWatching the old black and white footage and Prince Philiprsquos military service in particular brought back memories of my grandfather Herbie and his brothers, including my uncle, Andy Andrews, who joined the Royal Navy.ldquoMy grandfather served in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers as a Regimental Sergeant Major serving in India in the s and in the Second World War in Belgium where, behind enemy lines, he was shot.ldquoMiraculously, the bullet struck a pocket watch that his mother gave him, saving his le.

My father described the Prince as the perfect gentleman.ldquoHis sad passing does indeed mark the end of a era Prince Philip was truly unique and I know that from talking to my dad that he enjoyed his visits to Northern Ireland. The Prince will be missed most by his family, but he has left an indelible mark and the success of his Duke of Edinburgh award scheme is unparalleled.Terry said the torch for environmental issue which was taken up Sir David Attenborough so many years ago was one once carried by Prince Philip whose care for the such an important issue has been passed to his eldest son Prince Charles.He added: ldquoPrince Philip has left his mark on this world and there are many people from Northern Ireland who have met him over the years.ldquoThey recall a man with an infectious sense of duty and one who could also be humorous at times, using this aspect of his character to put others at ease.

She spoke of `a regrettable legacy of suffering’ acknowledging that the Royal Family also were `directly impacted’ by the conflict. Alex Maskey said few would ever be able to compare with the Duke’s `record of public service’.By Sandra ChapmanSaturday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Irish patriot Maude GonneI would suggest many people were surprised to hear the `effusive tributes’ to the Duke of Edinburgh who died this week, delivered in the Assembly by the Speaker, West Belfast MLA Alex Maskey and deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill. She spoke of `a regrettable legacy of suffering’ acknowledging that the Royal Family also were `directly impacted’ by the conflict. Alex Maskey said few would ever be able to compare with the Duke’s `record of public service’.During the week I had been reading a biography of Maud Gonne, a woman born of the aristocracy but who shunned its trappings to become a passionate advocate of Irish freedom. Ireland’s leading poet of the day, William Butler Yeats,`devotedly pursued her for years’ but Maud did nothis devotion. Her greatest love was Ireland, her lelong fight was to get rid of the English whose record in the country she constantly trashed. By the time she died in , aged  she hadn’t achieved that goal and mostly today she is remembered for the battles she fought to feed the children of impoverished Ireland and her support for the rebels who didn’t succeed in making Ireland a united country. Many Irish politicians of those years regarded her as more of a nuisance. WB Yeats died loving her to the end. Today’s younger generation may never have heard of Maude Gonne but she’s a worthy historical figure.Samuel Levenson who wrote her biography mentions `the relative quiet that attended her passing’. He believed she had `lived too long’ at a time when `patriotism was in a slump’. The Irish Republican Army was again `blowing up buildings in London but no-one knew why. Emigration and poverty were continuing and people were still in jail but there was nothing new or exciting in that’ he wrote.In some respects she was the Bernadette Devlin of the day, a fighter for a united Ireland who was also hero worshipped. Where is Bernadette now  Where are all those names which filled our newspapers daily as Ulster strived to withstand its enemies who wanted to blow it into a united Ireland This is Northern Ireland’s Centenary year and already the event is being `snubbed’ by Republicans. Sinn Fein Communities Minister in the Assembly Deirdre Hargey was accused this week of `a callous snub’ when she declared her department in Stormont had no plans to mark the th anniversary of the birth of Ulster. Unionists want a centenary stone to be installed at Stormont. Ms Hargey declares it ‘reflects only one political perspective’ declaring, when criticised, `that there is nothing callous in my approach’.Yet Michelle O’Neill and Alex Maskey took a completely unexpected tone when they praised His Royal Highness for his contribution to public service. Shinners praising a Royal, even one who has passed on, is not something we are used to. And then there is the question of the stone. The Protestant community of Ulster feels it deserves a commemorative stone to be erected at Stormont in this centenary year. Go anywhere in the world and you will find commemorative stones and statues which represent achievement and give a visitor an instant history lesson of the place. By now the stone should have been erected – after all we are four months into the centenary year – but one suspects it is still on the drawing boards because it requires majority approval of the Assembly and despite the generous aknowledgements from Sinn Fein this week regarding the Duke of Edinburgh’s contribution to the world and his exemplary support of the Queen who did her bit for peace here by meeting Martin McGuinness, the stone is viewed in stony silence by nationalist politicians. I suppose you could sayMaud Gonne was around today she would be proud of them.Now I wonder what Maud would have thought of the NI Protocol the battles over which have left over  police officers injured and street riots the like of which we haven’t seen for a decade or two  Maud’s speciality was street protests to make her claims heard. I think she would have been in the thick of them.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The restrictions have worst had the worst economic impact on people employed in certain sectors the worst lestyle impact on people who cannot work from home the worst psychological impact on people who do not have gardens or who lack social networks or are in unhappy relationships and the worst educational impact on pupils who do not have supportive s or access to computers.Covid remains a real risk.

Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors. MrEagle commented: ldquoClosure has had a massive impact on us. We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

Irsquom opposed to this plan. Itrsquos a loss of open countryside yet again, and the big issue of course that wersquore concerned about in Llantwit Major is the impact on local infrastructure.ldquoWe have two surgeries in Llantwit Major: one is nearly falling down. Our leisure centre is over  years old it has never really been improved upon in that time. Our traffic is chock-a-block the roads are gridlocked at peak periods.ldquoWhorsquos going to live in these homes  Wersquore building more and more homes all the time, but there are so many homes already available. Therersquos not the jobs in the area. The western Vale is becoming a concrete jungle.More NewsThousands of jobs saved at Peacocks as buyout agreedPenarth pub gardens readers said they would when restrictions easeWelsh Waters green energy plant in Dinas Powys a step closerThe plans are split across two parts: a western site of . hectares with  homes, adjacent to the B and an eastern site of . hectares with  homes, north of Bethesdarsquor Fro Church. About  per cent of the planned homes will be affordable.     Both sites would be accessed off of the Northern Access Road, also known as Fford Bro Tathan. This new road was built in  and , running from the B north of Boverton to the St Athan enterprise zone and Aston Martin factory.Planning officers responded to Cllr Johnrsquos concerns by pointing to the newly built road, as an example of new traffic infrastructure in the area and saying new residents of the proposed homes could help local shops by bringing them extra trade.A plan showing the layout of site A Picture: WYG Free to use for all LDRS partnersAn image showing the layout of the siteAnother concern was noise pollution: the eastern site is close to a firing range used by the Ministry of Defence. Councillors on the planning committee feared future residents could suffer from hearing loud gunfire. Planning officers said they could make noise complaints.David Harris, who lives in the local area, told the planning committee: ldquoThis site is located right opposite and within  metres of a live MOD firing range. This range can be used seven days a week, up to pm. Itrsquos regularly used.ldquoNo matter how much mitigation is used in the building fabric, you canrsquot reduce the exceptional noise of live gun fire when you have your windows open or when yoursquore in your garden. This fact alone makes this site totally inappropriate for residential development.Because the housing development is split into two sites, councillors voted on two separate planning applications, one for each site.The second application, for the eastern site, only narrowly passed a vote. Six councillors voted in favour of granting planning permission, and six voted against, with four abstaining. Planning officers warned refusing permission could risk a costly legal challenge.As the vote was tied, the chair of the planning committee, Cllr Jonathan Bird, used his casting vote to grant permission, effectively voting twice. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They are really daunted and concerned by the move away from this method of payment.“Some elderly folk I have assisted feel overwhelmed with the terms and conditions which they must sign up to operate a current account with a card facility and some don’t have all the identity documents required. Whilst this is routine for many who are well used to signing up for ious services, elderly people can be more reticent of paper work and what it all means.”Mr Irwin explained: “I feel there could be steps that banking organisations could take to enable this process in these specic circumstances to be slightly less burdensome on the elderly. This could be around offering greater assistance one-to-one and through simplying the process, for instancethe person has limited identication documents. There is a lot of detail contained in the benefits letters that people received and I feel it would be easy for banks to quickly very a person’s identy and reason for opening an account on this specic basis with further verication provided by the Department for Communities.“The Payment Exception Service will also operate from this summer which will help through the issuing of redeemable vouchers to those pensioners who have been unable to open a bank account. However, this will be a short term measure and thus there remains a time pressure for the creation of a bank account. I will again be raising these matters with the Minister for Communities to encourage greater co-operation with banks to ensure no one is disenfranchised or greatly inconvenienced.”Horror as bags of dead lambs found during evening stroll Read full story here--Editor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.

Named after a Hockey legend it is famed for its coffee and freshly bakedgoods – including an extensive range of home-made doughnuts.Taking councillors through a report which recommended the application was approved, a council planning officer told members the application was before them as it had receiveda high number of objections and petitions.Prominent amongst the objectors, is Peter Pan’s Neverland children’s play centre. The play centre will be a neighbour of the new drive-through and a petition collated by it contained , signatures objecting to the proposed application.Members were told the application site is currently used as a car park and there will be “no loss of retail use should the application be approved”.Members were also advised the proposed access points to the site have been heavily revised to limit the impact of potential traffic congestion in the area.Speaking about vehicular access, Alderman Gareth Wilson said the plans showed  vehicles in the queueand noted that at ious points in Portadown a build up of traffic is possible and asked what impact this proposal would have on traffic in the area.The planning officer told the meeting, as long as the proposal can accommodate vehicles it meets the policy and noted how the access is via Sandy Row, not Meadow Lane.“The access to the site has been looked at in detail and that is why access is not onto the main arterial route – the scheme was designed with that in mind,” said the planning officer.Councillor Sam Nicholson said he knows the area very well having used the area for his banking and noted how busy it can be. He then asked the engineer to provide some detail as to how they approached this design.In response, an engineer from Clyde Shanks said it had been recognised as an issue early in the design phase and had required a series of revisions before DfI Roads were satisfied.“We had five or six consultations with DfI Roads before we reached a satisfactory outcome,” said the engineer. “In that process the drive-throughincreased and was moved to the back of the site.“At present, drive-throughsare very popular and this one will be able to take about  vehicles. To address concerns about the traffic lights, the site will be accessible without going through them as customers will be able to access it via Sandy Row.”Councillor Paul Duffy noted the drive-through lanes appear to front onto the main road, like the McDonald’ssite in the vicinity and askedthere will be anything to deter pedestrians from taking a shortcut through the drive-through.He was advised a knee high rail fence will be erected to act as a barrier preventing this.Alderman Sydney Anderson also expressed some concern about the traffic flow and stated “I just hope there has been enough vision put into this to allow the traffic to build up on the premises as it can ill afford to back up on the road.“It is a busy junction most of the time and extra vehicles are to exit out onto the Sandy Row side, is everyone quite happy these plans and the road network can sustain this impact.”The planning officer answered Alderman Anderson’s question, telling the chamber it has taken a “considerable amount of time and focus”.“At present it is an existing  car, car park,” said the planning officer.“This means  cars could potentially come and go as they please at any time of day or night and we have no control over that.”An engineer from Clyde Shanks also noted the site expects to accommodate vehiclesan hour at peak times.“That is an extra vehicle every two minutes between the two roads,” said the engineer. “And that is assuming this is new traffic coming to the area but Tim Hortons are keen to come to this location becauseof the number vehicles and people in the area already.”Councillor Peter Lavery said he was “leaning towards approval” and noted the applicant has put a “number of measures” in place to address concerns about traffic build up.“They have done everything they can to mitigateour concerns and we should be noting and welcoming that,” he said.Alderman Wilson said he held the same opinion as Cllr Lavery while Councillor Duffy said he would be minded to approve as well but felt the traffic lights in the area may need some adjustment to accommodatethe extra traffic turning into this facility.Alderman Sydney Anderson said he was “encouraged by the amount of effortto look at potential traffic problems” and proposed the application was approved.This proposal was seconded by Cllr Nicholson who praisedthe application for being “very creative on what could have been a restrictive site” and the committee voiced its approval for this proposal.The development has beeen welcomed by local MLA Jonathan Buckley, who described it as ‘another great asset for our town’.  \"       \"  Most PopularTim Hortons set for PortadownLaura Gracey, a woman of substance, has died arrested after ‘serious assault’\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.portadowntimes news witness-appeal-after-serious-assault- itm_sourceparsely-api\" arrested after ‘serious assault’\" \"\" width\"\"Manarrested after ‘serious assault’Dozens of pupils sent home after positive COVID test at NI collegeHopes for resolution of Bannview Medical Practice problems suffer serious setbackMost PopularPlanning to get outdoors this weekend  Here’s the NI weather forecastNeil Lennon video -
