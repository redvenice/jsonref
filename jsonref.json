Mr Kiisler, who is the environment minister of Estonia, added: ‘This is the strongest message to give.’It is hoped that half a million people will take part in the Great British Spring Clean, making it Britain’s biggest ever mass environmental action. Mr Kiisler said he was proud to have been involved in a similar event to the Great British Spring Clean in Estonia, called ‘Let’s Do It’, which began in 2008. He also took part in World Clean-up Day, an event in September.Mr Kiisler’s endorsement of the British event is similar to when his senior UN colleague Erik Solheim praised the Daily Mail’s Turn The Tide On Plastic campaign at a global summit in 2017.Earlier yesterday, Mr Kiisler led one minute’s silence for the 22 UN officials who died in the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash as they flew to Nairobi.Delegates from the Environment Assembly sobbed as they remembered the victims of the air disaster, some of whom were on their way to the event.  Swimming champions taking the plunge to highlight plastic menaceThey are used to performing their flawless routine in pristine pools.But these teenage synchronised swimming champions volunteered to attempt it amid the kind of plastic rubbish that litters the world’s oceans – to raise awareness of the plight of marine animals.Kate Shortman, 17, and 18-year-old Isabelle Thorpe performed twirls, kicks and half-somersaults surrounded by plastic bottles, containers, carrier bags and toiletries.

Negotiations with Brussels had failed. It appeared that Britain’s last days in the European Union had turned into a fiasco, and the Prime Minister’s heroic three-year quest to deliver Brexit was doomed\u0027This last-minute dash meant only one thing. The Prime Minister smelt a deal in the offing. One that could help her muster enough support in the House of Commons.But is she right?Has Mrs May extracted enough from Brussels to satisfy the 118 Tory Brexiteers who voted down her deal in January – in the process inflicting the largest defeat on a sitting prime minister in living memory?We won’t know the answer to that question till later today, but the problem is simple to explain. Mrs May cannot hope to get the support of Tory rebels if her withdrawal arrangement leaves Britain stuck forever in the Irish backstop – meaning that Northern Ireland must stay in the customs union, subject to European rules but with no decision making capacity.Brexiteers say that such an arrangement turns Britain into a ‘vassal state’. Not in a million years will they vote for it.However, if Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of Commons.Last night the Government and Brussels agreed a plan that could enable Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to alter his legal advice on the backstop.The package includes a new legally-binding document that should allow the UK to seek an exit from the backstop if the EU tries to make it permanent, along with legal status for a separate package of assurances offered by Brussels in January.The MPs’ vote today is one of the most fateful parliamentary votes in British history.The mere fact that Mrs May went to Strasbourg yesterday evening for a meeting with Mr Juncker sends a strong signal that the Prime Minister is confident that she’s got a deal.          \u0027If Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured), and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of CommonsMay returns to Downing Street after winning \u0027legally binding...Trouble for Jeremy Corbyn? Almost 100 Labour MPs and peers...Share this articleShe hardly want to risk a humiliating failure.But remember this. The Prime Minister is not the ultimate arbiter. She will have to defer to her Attorney General. In uncanny ways Mr Cox finds himself in the same situation as his predecessor Lord (Peter) Goldsmith found himself in ahead of the Iraq war in 2003.Tony Blair was desperate to invade. But he could not give the order to send troops to Iraq until he received a formal undertaking from Goldsmith that the war was legal. And we now know that Blair twisted Lord Goldsmith’s arm to ensure that he came to the ‘right’ decision.Geoffrey Cox is thought to be made of sterner stuff. Unlike the hapless Goldsmith, MPs believe he is his own man.Last January he struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’.That is why Mrs May needs Mr Cox to confirm that the Irish backstop problem has been solved. A Cox veto – and she and her deal are both finished.Crucially, Mr Cox did not fly to Strasbourg with Mrs May. He stayed at Westminster, keeping his distance.          \u0027Last January Geoffrey Cox (pictured) struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’Very wise. More than anyone else, Mr Cox has the future of Mrs May in his hands. And – far more importantly – Britain’s future in the EU.Brexiteers insist, nevertheless, that even he does not have the final say. Members of the European Research Group of hardline rebels have employed a team of eight lawyers to make their own judgment. Who can say what advice they will give?Nevertheless, matters were looking much more hopeful last night. There was a spring in the Prime Minister’s step.We will know later today whether she achieved enough to convince the Tory rebels.If she hasn’t, Britain is on course to crash out of the European Union without a deal on March 29.Matters will no longer be in Mrs May’s hands. With time running out, Parliament could move to delay the implementation of Article 50 and rule out No Deal. In which case, political and economic upheaval looms. The stakes could not be higher. "},{"url":null,"title":"Another tape appears R Kelly girls lawyer says","story":"    R Kelly\u0027s attorney Steve Greenberg (above Saturday) responded to reports that there is a third video tape that shows the singer sexually abusing multiple young girls in the 90s by accusing the public of jumping to conclusions. He told TMZ on Sunday: \u0027R Kelly denies that he is on any tape with underaged girls. The doubt here is self-evident, with reporting that the man on the tape kinda, sorta looks like R Kelly. That doesn\u0027t make it him. It is not him\u0027              Gary and Sally Dennis came forward with the tape on Sunday, which they claimed to have come across in an old box of VHS sports videos at their home in Pennsylvania a few weeks ago. Gary Dennis (right) said one of the tapes had \u0027R Kelly\u0027 written on it, so he assumed it would be an old concert. But when he watched it, he was horrified to see a man who looks like Kelly engaging in sexual acts with young African American girlsThe Dennises spoke at a press conference on Sunday in New York alongside their attorney, Gloria Allred.  Gary Dennis, an assistant at a nursing home, gave a description of what was on the tape, saying of the man believed to be Kelly: \u0027He was telling them what to do and what to say, and it appeared that he was in control of the camera. \u0027In addition, he was engaging with these children in sexually abusive acts. He appeared to be in command of the girls and they looked as though they were just saying and doing what he told them to do.\u0027 He said he was \u0027disgusted\u0027 and \u0027horrified\u0027 by what he saw on the video.  \u0027I can\u0027t get the memory out of my head, it just stays with me constantly.

She didn\u0027t say why it went to that venue. She said the identity of the young girls was not known but there was no reason to believe they were the same victims who recently came forward for the documentary \u0027Surviving R Kelly\u0027. Allred noted that the video appeared to have been filmed in the 1990s and that her clients assumed the girls were underage because they were not \u0027fully developed\u0027.Without going into specifics about the abuse, Allred said: \u0027It is fair to say, however, that no child should ever be subjected to the kind of abuse and degrading sexually predatory misconduct depicted on the tape.\u0027 Allred represents women who say they were abused by Kelly. Dennis said he came across the tape in a box full of old VHS videos while he was searching through old sports games he had recorded. He said he doesn\u0027t know Kelly and doesn\u0027t know where the tape came from   Kelly is facing 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse in connection to three girls and one woman. The R\u0026ampB singer has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty after being charged last monthKelly has been dogged for decades by allegations that he victimized women and girls. Kelly is facing 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse in connection to three girls and one woman. The R\u0026ampB singer has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty after being charged last month. In an interview that aired Wednesday and Thursday on CBS This Morning, Kelly pleaded with viewers to believe that he never had sex with anyone under age 17 and never held anyone against their will. He was released from jail on Saturday where he had been held in connection to overdue child support. He was released after a payment for more than $161,000 was made on his behalf. Attorney Michael Avenatti has also said he has turned over two videos to prosecutors that he says shows Kelly sexually abusing girls. "},{"url":null,"title":"Les Mis star David Oyewolo wants black James Bond","story":"    Les Miserables actor David Oyewolo said he wants to be the first black James Bond to give a generation of black youngsters \u0027a superhero to identify with\u0027Man arrested for choking driver who wouldn\u0027t stop singing...Man shot dead in Melbourne \u0027predicted his own death on...Share this article\u0027One of the most beautiful things I have seen in America on Halloween is white kids running around in Black Panther costumes. \u0027I did not have a superhero to identify with growing up on a council estate in Islington.

But what was the point of going up there to stay there on my own?What should I do with a house that had been such a huge and emotional and beloved part of her life for so long?For most of the past 30 years we had lived there half the year, roughly from May till October. We made a rule never to come to London when we were there, and vice versa. We broke it a few times, for family dramas, and of course they made visits, but it meant we only made that awful M1M6 journey once a year. How perfect is that?In each house, Loweswater and London, both by chance dating from the 1860s, our basic working life was exactly the same. We were at our desks each morning, moving words around. In Lakeland, my wife sat with her pen and ink, smiling quietly to herself when she heard me effing and blinding as the electricity went off, yet again, or the broadband was down.In the afternoon, we walked. In London, walking down Kentish Town High Road, going for my regular swims, you have to try hard to breathe — not quite the same as rambling round beautiful Crummock Water.A few years after we moved in I bought five fields, around 15 acres, which surround the house. I created an orchard, tree house and rebuilt the drystone walls.I loved our little town of Cockermouth, an architectural gem, where I swam three times a week, poked around the antique shops, met local friends, had lunch. I did get upset when anyone asked, ‘Enjoying your holidays?’ ‘Do you mind?’ I’d say. ‘We live here.’I liked to think I was part of the community all those years, entering for the Loweswater Show, taking part in events, getting to know everyone. It took time. Cumbrian farming folk winter you, they summer you, winter you again — then they say hello.

We hesitated and said London, but only when the time comes, so we stressed. London is, after all, where our children and grandchildren live.Alas, with the death of Margaret, the time came to decide. What would happen if I was living there on my own? Aged 80, what would happen if I was ill, with my local GP seven miles away?As for hospitals, God knows where they are now. In recent years, when locals have been seriously ill, they have had to go to hospital in Newcastle or Lancaster, miles away, in a different county.Hunting for love at 82! HUNTER DAVIES reveals the joys and...How do I work the dishwasher again? Writer Hunter Davies,...Share this articleSome months after Margaret died, I spent six weeks on my own in Loweswater to see if I could stand it, if I could survive being on my own in a fairly large and remote house.It was a strange feeling. In London I had grown used by now to the absence of Margaret. At first I’d think I could see her through the window, sitting reading on the downstairs couch when I came home through the back way, walking across the garden, but that soon faded. I was so busy in London, so active, so many social activities.In Loweswater, though, during those weeks on my own, I imagined she was there, in the house with me, all the time.Each day when I came back from my walk to the lake, or from Cockermouth, I opened the front door and I expected to find a note from her, written in her bold and impeccable handwriting.The notes normally contained one of three messages:Do not disturb. I am working. Answer your own bloody phone calls, it has gone non-stop.Have gone to the lake, down the Lonning, back the Scenic Way.If it was the latter, and she had put the time she left, I would immediately turn round and go and meet her.In Lakeland, it had always been just us, we two, at constant close quarters, in a remote rural situation. Little wonder I now sensed and saw her presence all the time.In London, we had our three children living near by, and grandchildren, friends and neighbours we had known for 50 years, visitors for work and pleasure popping in. In London there were always distractions. In Lakeland, I was alone with my thoughts and memories. So I decided to sell.          It was a strange feeling. In London I had grown used by now to the absence of Margaret. In Loweswater, though, during those weeks on my own, I imagined she was there, in the house with me, all the timeThe local estate agent I contacted to do the dirty deed — well, it seems dirty to me, awfully disloyal to Lakeland — boasted that they employed a drone and a fully qualified drone pilot. The idea was to hover in the air, about 400ft high, film and photograph our lovely house, and my lovely five fields, and show the three lovely lakes within walking distance. Isn’t modern technology grand?I had decided to show all prospective buyers round the house myself, to talk to them, find out where they were from, what they were really looking for.After all, I knew the house, knew the problems and pleasures — unlike the estate agents.It was such an intimate experience, showing strangers your bedroom, watching them lift up carpets you would rather they did not, avoiding sinks for fear of catching the plague, or entering a room and making a face at your wallpaper.In the end there were six who were seriously interested. Four were roughly local while two had come from farther afield. One was from London and the other from the West Country, both men who had left their wives at home. They each stayed overnight locally, returning the next morning for a second look.I was amazed they were investing so much time. Then I remembered that when we bought the house I had come from London on the train for the day, on my own. It could well have been a total waste of time.Blow me, next day both men made offers — at the asking price. I suppose I could have tried to get them higher, but I was so delighted by their enthusiasm for the area, which they already knew well, and their clear love for the house.I had cross-examined each about their finances when I had taken them round, subtly of course. I am known in our family for being subtle and discreet — har har. The one from the West Country would be getting a mortgage on his existing house while the Londoner appeared to have the cash already, having sold some internet company. It could have been a lie of course, but I believed him.He turned out to be a Tottenham Hotspur season-ticket holder, so clearly a man who was totally sensible and reliable. I don’t think I could have sold it to an Arsenal fan. So I accepted his offer.He then wanted a full survey done, which was a bit of a worry. When I bought the house at auction, I never had a survey. I decided I loved it so much that I would accept any faults. Just like falling in love with my dear wife.But the survey was OK and the Londoner hurried me into a quick sale, offering to exchange contracts and complete all on the same day. Usually there is a gap of about a month. It meant I had to clear up and empty the house much more quickly than I had planned.In a way, the speed made the agony less. I was too busy to mope and mourn or have any second thoughts — which I had been having, thinking, Oh God, what have I done? It was not just that Margaret had died. I now felt part of me was dying as well.I had to quickly get rid of all the furniture and my treasures — or what I call my treasures. The real rubbish I dumped, lesser rubbish went to charity shops, while some of the choicer items I gave away, such as an 1810 guidebook to Lakeland, written anonymously by Wordsworth, which I gave to his home, Dove Cottage.The ordinary domestic stuff went into Mitchells auction house in Cockermouth in their ordinary domestic weekly sales. That was agony, seeing items of furniture we so loved, comfy fireside easy chairs we had spent a fortune re-covering, going for piddling sums.I don’t know why people ever buy new stuff when you can get excellent second-hand furniture so reasonably.Yet the price fetched for one tatty item, a stuffed red squirrel in a wooden case which was falling to pieces, amazed me. I had kept it in the fireplace in my office and looked at it every day as I sat down to work, thinking I really should repair it or at least dust it. It must have been harbouring appalling germs. It went for £60.I didn’t go to any of the sales. I couldn’t bear to see any of my beloved objects being brutally dismissed, going for peanuts or, worst of all, ending up with that dreaded word beside them — unsold.I SPENT the final two nights in an empty house, lying on a mattress on the wooden floor in an empty bedroom. All the contents, the domestic junk as well as the treasures, had gone.Getting down on the floor was relatively easy — you just flop, collapse — but getting up, oh my God, that was agony. I had to roll over and somehow prop myself up with my elbow. I had not realised how low a floor is, and how high a normal bed is. Or how old I was. So I flopped back on the mattress again. I felt like a squatter in someone else’s neglected, forgotten home.I stared round at the bedroom walls. I could see the faded patches where our prized paintings had been. I stared out of the naked windows at Grasmoor, the looming fell after which our house is named.All 14 windows in the house have stunning views, back and front, of the fells and fields, lakes and landscape. The curtains had gone as well, after the man from Mitchells pointed out they were Sandersons, in William Morris design, and would fetch some money. Good job Margaret never told me how much she had spent on them. I would have moaned.Lying there, with my eyes closed, I could see the family and all the visitors to the house over the years. I could see John Prescott, whose autobiography I ghostwrote, and his lovely wife Pauline both sitting in our garden, with two heavies in a corner, keeping an eye on him, as he was deputy prime minister at the time.I could hear my fellow Cumbrian Melvyn Bragg admiring my conservatory, asking how I had got planning permission. I could see all our three children and grandchildren at my wife’s 70th birthday party eight years earlier.On my very last day in the house, our son Jake and his wife Rosa drove up to help me bring stuff back to London — the personal bits and pieces, photographs and mementos, nothing really valuable, just things I wanted to keep. We reminisced of course about their memories of the house and of Margaret in it, such as the time, on her 50th birthday, she had got up at five o’clock and climbed Red Pike.The night before, when asked what she really wanted on her birthday, she said her special treat would be to climb Red Pike first thing in the morning with me. I said great, I’ll come. Alas, I slept in and never heard her getting up.She brought me tea in bed at eight as usual and I remarked that her hair was wet.‘Oh, is it?’ she said. ‘Probably because I got up at five and climbed Red Pike and had a swim in Crummock. I nearly woke you, but you were sound asleep . . .’I love this story, even if it is at my expense. It has become a family legend — the image of her going off on her own, enjoying herself so much, then gently boasting about it.Jake now does not quite believe it. He recently got out the map and thinks she could not have got as far as the top of Red Pike and back in three hours from our house. But she had obviously been somewhere, I said. Her hair was wet. She must have had a swim. He still does not believe it.Margaret did tend to ‘improve’ stories, exaggerate, but then she was a proper novelist. I plan to believe that story for ever, that she did climb Red Pike and swim in the lake on her 50th birthday.And that was the house sold, 30 years of our life cleared away, packed up, gone for ever. Only the memories remain.AS you get older, many things mean less. Money for example. I can’t afford any more time or energy to think about making money. Time is too short.My only worry now, as I write and as I lie awake in the middle of the night, is that something awful will happen to my back, or my hernia will explode. So far, so good.I don’t really worry, or get depressed, or not for long — half an hour perhaps. It is usually to do with my stupid computer playing up, trying to buy or book something on the internet.But if I become housebound or bedridden, in constant pain and agony, I don’t know how I would cope. My cheerful-chappie character might prove a mirage.I would never willingly end my life, which Margaret always said she would, sending regular donations to Dignitas. In the end, she did not have the strength to leave the house and go to Switzerland.I am staying here in this house, whatever happens. I plan to finish myself off with an enormous amount of Beaujolais.I had a drink recently with an old friend and neighbour who used to be the chief economic advisor at the Treasury. He said that economic studies indicate people in their 70s underestimate how long they have to live — in other words, they fear they will pop off soon, so they start worrying about spending too much, saving hard in case they will be a burden and end up with a long and expensive and awful ailment.In fact, most of the 70-year-olds today do reach their 80s, and then they overestimate — thinking, Hurrah, got this far, got ages to live yet. And, of course, they have got this wrong.We folks entering our 80s have to realise we will be lucky to reach 84. In fact, only a quarter of people in their 80s end up suffering a long and expensive illness, which is why people who die in their 80s leave more than they intended to, luckily for the Treasury. I never really quite believe or understand these economic surveys, but I intend to take two morals from what I think my friend told me and intend to follow them from now on.Live, live, live. Spend, spend, spend.

I hope this extra effort from both sides will pay off.\u0027Mr Varadkar said the Irish Government was committed to exploring alternatives to the insurance policy in a timely way, in the event that the overall future relationship cannot be concluded in a satisfactory and timely manner.He warned: \u0027But it does not call into question that the backstop will apply unless and until better arrangements are agreed, with all parties using good faith and best endeavours to that aim.\u0027He said the newly-agreed texts recalled the dispute resolution mechanisms in the Withdrawal Agreement that could be invoked were either party to demonstrate bad faith, including the possibility of seeking a ruling from a panel of arbitrators.\u0027I hope that, together with the joint statement on the political declaration, it will provide a basis on which we can move forward again.\u0027Mr Varadkar said the threat of the UK leaving the EU with no deal had been a dark cloud for many months.\u0027A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the EU.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/12/00/06C8DDFE000007D0-0-image-a-1_1552349349487.jpg","title":"PETER OBORNE stakes not higher MPs prepare fateful vote history","story":"    \u0027At lunchtime yesterday Theresa May (pictured) looked finished. Negotiations with Brussels had failed. It appeared that Britain’s last days in the European Union had turned into a fiasco, and the Prime Minister’s heroic three-year quest to deliver Brexit was doomed\u0027This last-minute dash meant only one thing. The Prime Minister smelt a deal in the offing. One that could help her muster enough support in the House of Commons.But is she right?Has Mrs May extracted enough from Brussels to satisfy the 118 Tory Brexiteers who voted down her deal in January – in the process inflicting the largest defeat on a sitting prime minister in living memory?We won’t know the answer to that question till later today, but the problem is simple to explain. Mrs May cannot hope to get the support of Tory rebels if her withdrawal arrangement leaves Britain stuck forever in the Irish backstop – meaning that Northern Ireland must stay in the customs union, subject to European rules but with no decision making capacity.Brexiteers say that such an arrangement turns Britain into a ‘vassal state’. Not in a million years will they vote for it.However, if Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of Commons.Last night the Government and Brussels agreed a plan that could enable Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to alter his legal advice on the backstop.The package includes a new legally-binding document that should allow the UK to seek an exit from the backstop if the EU tries to make it permanent, along with legal status for a separate package of assurances offered by Brussels in January.The MPs’ vote today is one of the most fateful parliamentary votes in British history.The mere fact that Mrs May went to Strasbourg yesterday evening for a meeting with Mr Juncker sends a strong signal that the Prime Minister is confident that she’s got a deal.          \u0027If Mrs May has persuaded the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured), and chief negotiator Michel Barnier to provide an escape route from the backstop, then her deal has a chance of getting through the House of CommonsMay returns to Downing Street after winning \u0027legally binding...Trouble for Jeremy Corbyn? Almost 100 Labour MPs and peers...Share this articleShe hardly want to risk a humiliating failure.But remember this. The Prime Minister is not the ultimate arbiter. She will have to defer to her Attorney General. In uncanny ways Mr Cox finds himself in the same situation as his predecessor Lord (Peter) Goldsmith found himself in ahead of the Iraq war in 2003.Tony Blair was desperate to invade. But he could not give the order to send troops to Iraq until he received a formal undertaking from Goldsmith that the war was legal. And we now know that Blair twisted Lord Goldsmith’s arm to ensure that he came to the ‘right’ decision.Geoffrey Cox is thought to be made of sterner stuff. Unlike the hapless Goldsmith, MPs believe he is his own man.Last January he struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’.That is why Mrs May needs Mr Cox to confirm that the Irish backstop problem has been solved. A Cox veto – and she and her deal are both finished.Crucially, Mr Cox did not fly to Strasbourg with Mrs May. He stayed at Westminster, keeping his distance.          \u0027Last January Geoffrey Cox (pictured) struck a body blow to the Prime Minister when he warned there was a risk that the backstop ‘would endure indefinitely’Very wise. More than anyone else, Mr Cox has the future of Mrs May in his hands. And – far more importantly – Britain’s future in the EU.Brexiteers insist, nevertheless, that even he does not have the final say. Members of the European Research Group of hardline rebels have employed a team of eight lawyers to make their own judgment. Who can say what advice they will give?Nevertheless, matters were looking much more hopeful last night. There was a spring in the Prime Minister’s step.We will know later today whether she achieved enough to convince the Tory rebels.If she hasn’t, Britain is on course to crash out of the European Union without a deal on March 29.Matters will no longer be in Mrs May’s hands. With time running out, Parliament could move to delay the implementation of Article 50 and rule out No Deal. In which case, political and economic upheaval looms. The stakes could not be higher. "},{"url":null,"title":"Those lose sleep calls nature harm work performance life satisfaction","story":"Self-confessed sex addict, 30, who\u0027s slept with 200 men and...\u0027They say we are infidels for showing our faces\u0027: Refugee...Share this articleBut there was a 2.3 per cent drop for women over 50, similar to the effect of having kidney disease or high blood pressure.Lead author Marco Hafner said: ‘Frequent visits to the bathroom at night can affect the quality of people’s sleep which can be extremely bothersome for some.‘It can have a negative impact on their general feelings of wellness and also means they feel less engaged at work and their ability to perform at work may be impaired.

Pictured: Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 (stock image)Minutes after take-off the plane suddenly nose-ed hitting speeds of 600mph before slamming into the sea.The warning issued today read: \u0027The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee has indicated that Lion Air flight 610 experienced erroneous input from one of its AOA (Angle of Attack) sensors.\u0027Boeing issued an Operations Manual Bulletin (OMB) directing operators to existing flight crew procedures to address circumstances where there is erroneous input from an AOA sensor.\u0027As a result of an investigation into the crash the jet manufacturer is said to be preparing a bulletin to be sent to operators of the 737 jets warning about faulty cockpit readings that could cause a e.The notice refers to the \u0027angle of attack\u0027, which is the angle of the wing relative to oncoming air stream, a measure that indicates if a plane is likely to stall.This angle of attack, which is a calculation of the angle at which the wind is passing over the wings, is used to be determined if a stall is imminent.Inspectors found faults on two other Boeing 737 MAX jets, including one which mirrored a problem reported on board the Lion Air plane.                        But Labour peer Lord Tunnicliffe, a former pilot, urged the Government to immediately ground the Boeing plane.He said: \u0027In my day we had a rule - If it can go wrong it will go wrong. The industry seems to have lost sight of this rule. I believe everybody involved will be shown to be in dereliction of their duty.\u0027Holidaymakers took to social media to voice their concerns.

Canada was next with 18 victims.There were also passengers from other countries including Ethiopia, Italy, the US, Britain and France.Among those on board was Italian archaeologist Sebastiano Tusa, 66, his wife Valeria Patrizia Li Vigni was quoted as saying by the Corriere della Sera newspaper.On Sunday, \u0027the friends I met at mass said I shouldn\u0027t worry because bad news travels fast,\u0027 she said.\u0027In the end it arrived anyway, and it destroyed my life.

Photograph: Joe Kilroy Everywhere, precious species are in decline. Sometimes, however, there is good news, such as the rare example of the recovery of the long-threatened Irish red squirrel.For years, the red has faced insurmountable competition from its grey cousin, but the growth of the pine marten’s population has brought a curb to its dominance, says Dr Colin Lawton of NUI Galway.Zoology researchers at NUIG have now teamed up with Ulster Wildlife and the Vincent Wildlife Trust to track exactly how many reds and greys exist, along with the numbers of pine martens.The public are being asked to take part by recording any sightings they make this year. The results will then be compared with previous surveys conducted in 1997, 2007 and 2012, but the latest survey will be the most detailed yet.More aggressiveSince their introduction in 1911 (a one-off introduction in Co Longford) the American grey squirrel, which is more aggressive than its red cousin, has spread throughout much of the island.Long considered vermin, grey squirrels destroy native woodland, strip young saplings of their bark, dig up flowers and raid birds’ nests. However, they do not kill their red cousins.Instead, they carry the deadly squirrel parapox virus, which does no harm to greys, but, if picked up by a red squirrel, will cause the infected animal to suffer an excruciating death within weeks.Currently, the island of Ireland has approximately 140,000 reds, but there are concerns that the population in Northern Ireland could all be gone within a generation.Reverse the tideHowever, pine martens are helping to reverse the tide, since the greys are easier for the martens to catch, while the reds are smaller and more nimble and spend less time foraging for food on the ground.“It seems the grey squirrels are not able to cope with this predator, either because they are naïve to the dangers, or are becoming stressed when the pine marten is present,” Dr Lawton.“The native red squirrel, on the other hand, has lived alongside the pine marten for centuries, and although occasionally eaten, they can co-exist quite happily,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Group claiming to be IRA says it posted five devices to British addressesPupil wants order quashing committee decision to disallow appeal against sanctionPostgradstudents can earn a better salary and have stronger employment prospectsMore than 21 events taking place coinciding with schools strikes for actionRaise the Roof march is told there should be increased funding for public housing, an end to evictions and a cap on rentsCarbon tax row escalates as PBP say draft report leak \u0026lsquotransparent attempt to sell tax as inevitable and good\u0026rsquoDocuments provide additional layer \u0026lsquointerpretation, clarification, elaboration\u0026rsquoDUP Brexit spokesman warns initial signs are not good, but his party will analyse deal in fullPedestrian struck on Luas Red Line on Monday nightJob satisfaction matters, but so does salary.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the agreement reached between the UK and the EU on Monday night is “positive” and “does not undermine the backstop”.Speaking in Government buildings on Tuesday morning, Mr Varadkar said the outcome was “positive”.“I hope and trust that the withdrawal agreement will now be endorsed by the House of Commons”, Mr Varadkar told reporters at an 8am press conference in Government Buildings.He said the documents published on Monday night were an “unambiguous statement from both parties”“It does not reopen the withdrawal agreement or undermine the backstop,” Mr Varadkar added.Mr Varadkar said the new Brexit documents agreed between the EU and UK “provide additional layer of interpretation, clarification and elaboration” ahead of votes tonight in Westminster.The British government claimed on Monday night it had won legally binding changes to the Northern Ireland backstop after the European Union agreed to two additions to the Brexit withdrawal agreement.During late-night talks in Strasbourg, Theresa May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker signed off on a joint interpretive instrument on the withdrawal agreement and a joint statement on the political declaration.David Lidington, the prime minister’s de facto deputy, told the House of Commons the interpretive instrument has the same legal status as the withdrawal agreement. He said it provides confirmation the EU cannot try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely and that doing so would be a breach of the legally-binding commitments both sides have agreed.“If – contrary to all expectations – the EU were to act with that intention, the UK could use this acceptance of what could constitute an explicit breach as the basis for a formal dispute, through independent arbitration, that such a breach had occurred – ultimately suspending the protocol if the EU continued to breach its obligations,” he said.Varadkar statementMr Varadkar, who last night delayed a trip to Washington for St Patrick’s Day, told reporters on Tuesday morning: “As you know, Prime Minister May met with President Juncker in Strasbourg a last night where they agreed an interpretative instrument on the withdrawal agreement and a joint statement on the political declaration on the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom.“The documents are complimentary to withdrawal agreement and the political declaration and aim to provide an additional layer of interpretation, clarification and elaboration to the United Kingdom ahead of a further voter in Westminster.“We are aware the United Kingdom has also published a unilateral declaration alongside the two joint documents agreed. In the context of tonight’s vote inn Westminster. The outcome of yesterday’s meeting with Prime Minister May and President Juncker is positive.“I hope and trust the withdrawal agreement will now be passed by the House of Commons. In discussion with the UK, the Government has worked hand-in-hand with our EU partners and our EU institutions, including the Commission and the task force led by Michel Barnier.“In that work we have insisted that the withdrawal agreement could not be rewritten and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that will achieve the same objectives: namely no hard border.“However, we have also said we’d be prepared to offer guarantees and reassurances to the United Kingdom of our good faith and intentions. Indeed we have offered such reassurances on many occasions. The instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed.“It does not reopen the withdrawal agreement or undermine the backstop or its application. It says we will work together in good faith in pursuit of a future relationship which ensures that the objectives of the protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border.“We are also committed to exploring alternatives in a timely way in the event that the overall future relationship cannot be concluded in a satisfactory and timely manner. But it does not call into question that the backstop will apply unless and until better arrangements are agreed with all parties using good faith and using best endeavours to that aim. So the options to ensure the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland continue to correspond to what was agreed as far back as the joint report in December 2017, which envisages these being achieved by one of three means.“First, a comprehensive future relationship between the EU and the UK. Second, specific solutions or third, in the absence of agreed solutions, regulatory alignment, ie the backstop.“The documents agreed yesterday reiterate our wish to establish a future partnership with the UK that is as close as possible and marks our commitment to ensure that our negotiations on the future relationship can begin as soon as the United Kingdom leaves. The instrument agrees in detail how we will go about this important work.”Mr Varadkar said it also “recalls the dispute resolution mechanisms within the withdrawal agreement that could be invoked were either party to demonstrate bad faith, including the possibility of seeking a ruling from a panel of arbitrators.“I hope together with the joint statement on the political declaration, it will provide a basis on which we can move forward again. The withdrawal agreement represents a clear compromise by all sides and the political declaration provides a strong framework for future work on the future relationship.“And the further steps agreed yesterday provide additional clarity, reassurance and guarantee sought by some to eliminate doubt or fears, however unreal, that the goal of some was to trap the UK indefinitely in the backstop. It is not. These doubts and fears can now be put to bed.“The withdrawal agreement, as you know, provides for a transitional period running at least until the end of 2020, during which nothing will change. This is really important for exporters, businesses employers, farmers and our fishermen. And regardless of the vote tonight, we have already secured the continuation of the Common Travel Area, the free movement of people north and south, and between Britain and Ireland. The right to live, work study and access healthcare, housing, education, pensions and welfare in each other’s countries as if we were citizens of both.“This is particularly important for citizens and students, cross border workers and expatriates in both countries. Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will, of course, continue to be citizens of the European Union no matter what happens.“In many ways, Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months, and in particular the threat of no deal. A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence an optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the European Union. We now need to see the withdrawal agreement ratified by Westminster and the European Parliament without further delay so we can get on with the important work of building a new relationship between the EU and the UK and between the UK and Ireland, post Brexit.“I now feel, for the remains of the day, we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what is now on the table.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Patrick SeegerEPAThe latest agreement between the EU and UK underlines that both sides will make every effort to avoid using the backstop – and to find a way out of it quickly if it is used. The UK has also given its interpretation of an arbitration system, designed to solve rows in relation to the backstop, arguing that this gives it further reassurance.MPs will vote (referred to as a ‘meaningful vote’) on this tonight. It is unclear, at this stage, how the vote will go. Much will depend on whether UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox changes earlier advice, which had been that the UK could find it impossible to leave the backstop arrangements. Why has the backstop become such as big deal?Because it cuts to the heart of the Brexit argument and pushes the UK to define what it wants life after Brexit to look like – something UK politics is finding very hard to do. And because the DUP have the whip hand in the House of Commons, supporting Theresa May’s government. To ensure there would be no hard Irish border – one where checks on goods movements are needed – the withdrawal agreement includes the backstop as an insurance policy, something which would apply unless and until some other way to avoid a hard border was found. This would be achieved by the UK staying in a basic customs unions with the EU and Northern Ireland following all of the EU’s customs and regulatory rules. In this way no checks would be needed at the Irish Border and limited checks would be needed on goods, food and animals crossing the Irish Sea. So what happened last night?Following weeks of negotiation, Theresa May’s dash to Strasbourg produced three items, the significant of which will be hotly contested today and quite possibly for a long time to come. The first was what is called an instrument, a document which sits alongside the withdrawal agreement and gives an agreed interpretation of it. It underlines the commitment of both sides to try to avoid using the backstop by reaching a new trade deal and also to examine other technological alternatives. Progress would be reviewed regularly every six months under a process in the agreement. It includes reference to both sides makes “ best endeavours” to avoid the backstop. It says that if the EU was found to have acted in bad faith by a joint arbitration agreement, the UK could “suspend” the backstop for a period.The second change was in the political declaration, a document accompanying the withdrawal agreement outlining how both sides see the future relationship working. It also underlines the commitment to work quickly on a new trade deal and look at alternatives to the backstop.What does it mean?This is being parsed and analysed and argued about. It does give the UK more assurance that the EU side will do all it can to avoid using the backstop – certainly in the long term. And to underline how it feels the arbitration mechanism could be used, if the talks do break down. However it does not give the UK a unilateral exit route from the backstop. It cannot decide itself simply to abandon it – it has to use the mechanisms in the agreement.What will the ‘meaningful vote’ mean?If the MPs vote for the withdrawal agreement, then the UK leaves the EU with a deal. This means the transition period kicks in once the UK leaves . This would mean no immediate change in trading arrangements and no disruption. The transition period if due to last until the end of 2020, though this can be extended to the end of 2022. The UK is currently due to leave on March 29th, though there is speculation that even if the agreement is passed a short extension could be needed to allow the necessary legislation to pass. Last night EU president Jean-Claude Juncker said in his view this extension could be until the European Parliament elections are held in late May.If the MPs reject the agreement again, then what happens after that is unclear. Theresa May has promised, in the event of rejection, to allow MPs to vote on Wednesday on whether or not they supported a no-deal exit and on Thursday on whether they wanted an extension to the Article 50 exit period. Beyond that it is unclear whether the prime minister could retain the support of her party, or there might even be a general lection. There is support in the House of Commons for a softer Brexit – involving closer trading links with the EU – and speculation that MPs may try to grab control of the agenda to force events in this direction.However a rejection by MPs will also put the risk of a no-deal exit back on the table. By severing trading links between the EU and UK overnight this would lead to disruption and significant economic risk for the UK – and for Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Vincent KesslerReutersBritish attorney general Geoffrey Cox has declined to change his legal advice on the withdrawal agreement and the backstop - throwing politics in the UK into utter confusion once again.But this is more a matter of politics than it is of law.Three documents were published Monday night to supplement the Withdrawal Treaty, and which will carry varying degrees of legal force. The first was a “joint instrument” – which presents an agreed interpretation of the Agreement and which could be relied upon in any court or arbitration hearings in the future in the event that relations between the two sides break down.It is the joint instrument which contains what the UK maintains are legally binding changes to the backstop. Simply put, it offers a route for the UK to exit the backstop if the EU has persistently behaved unreasonably and unfairly in dragging its feet on the backstop and the future trade relationship. Crucially, however, that judgment is not for the UK to make unilaterally – it can only follow a finding made by the joint arbitration process set up by the treaty in the first place.So do the changes agreed last night make it possible for the UK to unilaterally renounce the backstop if it feels like it? No.But does it show a route out of the backstop if the EU seeks to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely and capriciously? Yes.PoliticsHow likely it is the EU would do this is another matter. But the provision is clearly important for the British. That’s more politics than it is law.The second document is a joint EU-UK statement on the future relationship, which supplements the political declaration already agreed between the two sides.What is most notable here is the degree of urgency that it injects into the talks on the future trading relationship – which will now commence immediately. The great fear of Brexiteers is that these talks will drag on for years while the UK – as they see it – remains shackled to the EU, bound to observe its rules while having no say over their application or formulation.It restates the ambition to have the trade talks concluded by the end of next year – a deadline that many regard as highly ambitious. But the strength of the language in the statement will offer some comfort to the British and while it may not be legally actionable – it is full of ill-defined terms such as “expeditiously” and “at speed” – it will make the politics of the situation at Westminster easier for Mrs May.ContentiousThe third document is the most contentious one. Dublin sources Monday night dismissed this as the UK “talking to itself”. The UK argues that this is not entirely true – it will lodge the declaration with the UN and the EU will not dispute this, and – in the event of the matter coming to law – this could be relied upon by the UK to bolster its case. The fact that Dublin was reportedly unhappy with the document last night adds weight to the UK’s view.The document is a unilateral declaration made by the British government which gives its view of how it might exit the backstop if the EU and the UK cannot reach agreement on the future trading relationship. If this is the case – and therefore the backstop is triggered – the UK says it believes it can leave the backstop, but, crucially, under the terms of the existing agreement.As noted above, this means that a joint arbitration panel must decide that the EU has been persistently acting in bad faith in the negotiations. In other words, the UK can leave unilaterally – but only after a joint arbitration committee decides that the EU is essentially violating the Withdrawal Agreement and the EU declines to stop doing so.As a matter of law, that offers a unilateral exit mechanism. As a matter of politics, it seems an unlikely turn of events.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Edgar SuReutersSingapore and Australia suspended operations of all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in and out of their airports on Tuesday, and Indonesia and China grounded their fleets of the US planemaker’ s latest model after it suffered a second fatal crash in less than five months.The scare has wiped billions of dollars off the market value of the world’s biggest planemaker, as the Boeing Co share closed 5 per cent down on Monday having fallen by as much as 13.5 per cent at one point.Nearly 40 per cent of the in-service fleet of 371 Boeing 737 MAX jets globally is grounded, according to industry publication Flightglobal, including 97 jets in the biggest market, China.A day after a Ethiopian Airlines passenger jet plunged to the ground, killing all 157 people aboard, the United States stressed it was safe to fly the planes.But a statement issued by Singapore’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAAS) showed question-marks hanging over the aircraft after Sunday’s disaster could not be dispelled so fast.“During the temporary suspension, CAAS will gather more information and review the safety risk associated with the continued operation of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft into and out of Singapore,” the regulator said in a statement.It was the first major regulator to order such an action, but the anxiety was also evident among air travellers, who rushed to find out from social media whether they were booked to fly on 737 MAX planes – the same model involved in the Lion Air crash off Indonesia that killed 189 people in October.There has been no information yet to link the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines incidents.Hours later, Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority followed Singapore’s lead with a temporary suspension to review the risks, citing the best interests of safety.Investigators in Ethiopia found two black box recorders that will provide information about what happened before the plane plunged into farmland minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa. So long as the recordings are undamaged, the cause of the crash could be identified quickly, although it typically takes a year to fully complete an investigation.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a “continued airworthiness notification” for the 737 MAX late on Monday to assure operators, and detailed a series of design changes mandated by Boeing.Boeing issued a statement as well, saying it had been working with the FAA in the aftermath of a Lion Air crash to develop enhancements to flight control software that will be deployed across the 737 MAX fleet in coming weeks.The new MAX 8 variant of the 737, the world’s best-selling modern passenger aircraft, has bigger engines designed to use less fuel. It entered service in 2017.With another 4,661 on order, 737 Max 8s could become the workhorses for airlines around the globe for decades.Suspensions mountingEthiopian Airlines, which has four other 737 MAX 8 jets, said it was grounding them as a precaution.Gol in Brazil temporarily suspended MAX 8 flights, as did Argentina’s state airline Aerolineas Argentinas and Mexico’s Aeromexico. Singapore Airlines, whose SilkAir brand operates 6 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, said it has temporarily withdrawn its fleet and would re-accommodate affected customers.Other airlines that operate Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to Singapore – China Southern Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Shandong Airlines and Thai Lion Air – are also affected.Australia said Fiji Airways and SilkAir would be affected by its temporary suspension.China on Monday ordered its airlines to suspend the use of their 737 MAX 8 jets.A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it was hard to predict a detailed timetable for when the suspension would be lifted, emphasising that passenger safety was paramount.The current scare could jeopardise a potential commitment by China to buy more Boeing-made aircraft as part of a deal being negotiated to end a trade war with the United States.Indonesia on Monday said it would temporarily ground 737 MAX 8 jets operating in the country for inspections.South Korean budget carrier Eastar Jet will temporarily ground its two 737 MAX 8s from Wednesday to better cooperate with the government’s required emergency safety inspections, an airline spokesman said on Tuesday.Maintenance checksIndia’s regulator ordered additional maintenance checks on 737 MAX 8 aircraft operating in the country and said a review found “no significant concern”.Vietnam state media reported the aviation regulator will not issue licences to local airlines to operate the 737 MAX until the cause of the Ethiopian crash is determined.Still, major airlines from North America to the Middle East kept flying the 737 MAX, though Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau said he would not hesitate to take action once the cause of the crash is known.Southwest Airlines Co, which operates the largest fleet of 737 MAX 8s, said it remained confident in the safety of all its Boeing planes even as it fielded queries from customers.“Our customer relations team is responding to these customers inidually, emphasising our friendly, no-change fee policy,” the fourth largest US airline said in a statement.Flydubai said it had received the FAA’s continued airworthiness notification and no further action was required at this time, while Turkish Airlines said it was closely monitoring developments.Former FAA accident investigator Mike Daniel said he believed the decision by regulators to ground the planes was premature. “To me it almost surreal how quickly some of the regulators are just grounding the aircraft without any factual information yet as a result of the investigation,” he told Reuters.However, he said more groundings were now likely due to a “snowball effect” unless Boeing or the FAA released more information.– Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

More than 50 countries led by the US have endorsed him.Venezuela holds the worlds biggest oil reserves but its output has collapsed due to political mismanagementThis decision reflects the deteriorating situation in #Venezuela as well as the conclusion that the presence of US diplomatic staff at the embassy has become a constraint on US policy, Pompeo wrote on Twitter.On January 24 the State Department ordered all non-emergency government employees to depart Venezuela and urged Americans living in the country to consider leaving.Earlier Monday Pompeo took aim at Cuba and Russia for their support of Maduro.He rejected Maduro\u0027s assertion that the US was responsible for the blackout, instead pointing the finger at the socialist nature of the Venezuelan government.Nicolas Maduro promised Venezuelans a better life and a socialist paradise. He delivered on the socialism part, which has proved, time and time again, is a recipe for economic ruin, Pompeo told journalists.The paradise part? Not so much.Pompeo took aim at the central role Cuba and Russia have played and continue to play in undermining the democratic dreams of the Venezuelan people and their welfare.Cuba is the true imperialist power in Venezuela, Pompeo said, denouncing the physical protection and other critical material and political support to Maduro and to those around him.When there is no electricity, thank the marvels of modern Cuban-led engineering, he said. When there is no water, thank the excellent hydrologists from Cuba.When there is no food, thank the Cuban communist overlords.Please review our commenting policyWill Theresa May win tonight\u0026#39s Brexit vote?

Spike Lee\u0027s Clockers saw one of the director\u0027s most disappointing performances at the box office, taking just $13m from a $25m budget.Peter Berg\u0027s real-life drama fell more than $30m short of its $156m budget, a shame considering it\u0027s one of the Friday Night Lights creator\u0027s best films to date.Donnie Darko grossed just over $7.5m worldwide on a budget of $4.5m, not helped by its marketing campaign featuring a plane crash weeks before 911.Upon release, this cult horror was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $26.7m on a $60m production budget.There was something of a controversy surrounding David Fincher\u0027s Fight Club, which aided in making a modest profit of just under $40m at the box office.

Future Pixar director Brad Bird\u0027s film made $31.3m worldwide against a budget of $70–80m.While not a major flop, the classic underperformed at the Christmas box office due to stiff competition from other big films.Elaine May\u0027s maligned comedy, which is being reassessed with every passing year, became a notorious failure at the box office.2335 The King of Comedy (1982)Although Scorsese\u0027s drama was well-received by critics, it bombed at the box office. Lead Robert De Niro said that the film maybe wasn\u0027t so well received because it gave off an aura of something that people didn\u0027t want to look at or know.This unfairly maligned Disney release was a box office bomb, grossing only $260.5m worldwide against an estimated $225–250m production budget and an additional $150m in marketing costs.2535 Man on the Moon (1999)This Jim Carrey film from Milos Forman cost Universal a lot of money after it failed to make back its $52-82m budget.While making its money back, polarising reviews meat that Darren Aronofsky\u0027s psychological horror settled for a $14m profit.It\u0027s considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, but David Lynch\u0027s head-scratcher failed to make back its $20m budget.Despite positive reviews from critics, this spoof grossed just $9m, failing to meet its budget of $20m.  2935 Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)Edgar Wright\u0027s beloved cult was a box office bomb, grossing $47.7m against its production budget of $85–90m.This Stephen King adaptation was a box office disappointment, earning only $16m during its initial theatrical run. It would later get re-released and earn $58.3m.This fun action film starring Clive Owen recouped far less than its $39m budget.This Oscar-nominated noir didn\u0027t meet its budget despite sitting at a paltry $17m.It wasn\u0027t until its home entertainment release that this mockumentary became the beloved classic it is today. 3435 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)Valerian grossed $225m worldwide, but due to its high production and advertising costs, it was considered a commercial failure.3535 Willy Wonka \u0026amp the Chocolate Factory (1971)This beloved Roald Dahl adaptation starring Gene Wilder made just a $1m profit upon its original release in 1971.135 Children of Men (2006)While it\u0027s now revered as one of the best films of the 21st century, Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s dystopian thriller failed to make its money back at the box office at its time of release in 2006.235 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988)This Robin Williams comedy grossed just $8m against its $46m budget, losing the studio a staggering $38m.Ali opened in the US on Christmas Day, 2001, and grossed a total of $87.7m worldwide – and still lost an estimated $63.1m.435 The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)Andrew Dominik\u0027s lyrical western only just made back half of its $30m budget in 2007, but found love upon its release on DVD.Despite starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron, this drama was a certified bomb at the box office, making a total of $19.6m from a $75m budget.Steven Spielberg\u0027s Roald Dahl adaptation grossed just $183m against its $140m budget – a low profit by Disney\u0027s standards.Michael Mann\u0027s cyber thriller was a box office bomb, earning only $19.7m at the box office against a budget of $70m.Just like Ridley Scott\u0027s original flopped, this lengthy sequel from Denis Villeneuve grossed just $259m worldwide and is considered a flop.This Orson Welles film may be a beloved classic, but at the time release, it failed to recoup its costs at the box office.

Lead Robert De Niro said that the film maybe wasn\u0027t so well received because it gave off an aura of something that people didn\u0027t want to look at or know.This unfairly maligned Disney release was a box office bomb, grossing only $260.5m worldwide against an estimated $225–250m production budget and an additional $150m in marketing costs.2535 Man on the Moon (1999)This Jim Carrey film from Milos Forman cost Universal a lot of money after it failed to make back its $52-82m budget.While making its money back, polarising reviews meat that Darren Aronofsky\u0027s psychological horror settled for a $14m profit.It\u0027s considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, but David Lynch\u0027s head-scratcher failed to make back its $20m budget.Despite positive reviews from critics, this spoof grossed just $9m, failing to meet its budget of $20m.  2935 Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)Edgar Wright\u0027s beloved cult was a box office bomb, grossing $47.7m against its production budget of $85–90m.This Stephen King adaptation was a box office disappointment, earning only $16m during its initial theatrical run. It would later get re-released and earn $58.3m.This fun action film starring Clive Owen recouped far less than its $39m budget.This Oscar-nominated noir didn\u0027t meet its budget despite sitting at a paltry $17m.It wasn\u0027t until its home entertainment release that this mockumentary became the beloved classic it is today. 3435 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)Valerian grossed $225m worldwide, but due to its high production and advertising costs, it was considered a commercial failure.3535 Willy Wonka \u0026amp the Chocolate Factory (1971)This beloved Roald Dahl adaptation starring Gene Wilder made just a $1m profit upon its original release in 1971.The film won four Academy Awards, including the Oscar for Best Actor for Rami Malek, who plays Freddie Mercury.Bohemian Rhapsody\u0026nbspalso attracted criticism for the way it depicts Mercury’s life, especially aspects pertaining to his sexuality and HIV diagnosis.The movie was originally directed by Bryan Singer before he was removed from the project and replaced with Dexter Fletcher.Singer was hit by sexual abuse allegations during awards season, which caused GLAAD to remove\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody‘s nomination for Outstanding Film – Wide Release at the GLAAD Media Awards. He has denied the claims against him.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not long after he became children’s minister in January 2018, Mr\u0026nbspZahawi announced the appointment of a private company called Spectra First to\u0026nbspget more than 50 businesses to provide work-based opportunities to young people leaving the care system, including every government department.The competition to say the stupidest thing about Brexit has been wonDiary: Slick work brings in the cash for Tory MP Nadhim ZahawiNeigh way! MP Nadhim Zahawi apologises for stables expense claims“My diary secretary here is brilliant, I would hire her in a heartbeat,” Mr Zahawi says of one of his own hires. He has, since this interview took place, made her a permanent member of staff.\u0026nbsp“All they need is an opportunity in life. You just have to think about these kids in the round. You have to think about their life and their experiences slightly different to, dare I say it, our kids.”Mr Zahawi could not have had a more different start. He arrived in the UK at the age of nine,\u0026nbspthe child of Kurdish parents fleeing the war in Iraq. His first school was Holland Park, a comprehensive in west London. He later moved to Ibstock Place, a private school, and King’s College School, at the time an\u0026nbspindependent school for boys in Wimbledon.\u0026nbspHe won a place at University College London to study chemical engineering, but quickly showed an interest in businesses and started a property company after graduating. In business, he is best known for YouGov, the polling company he co-founded in a garden shed in 2000. He remained its chief executive until 2010, when he was elected to parliament.He gave up several additional business interests when he was\u0026nbspmade education minister in a cabinet reshuffle\u0026nbspin January 2018, including a £350,000-a-year, part-time job at Gulf Keystone, an oil company, and a 50 per cent stake in Zahawi and Zahawi, a firm he founded with his wife Lana in 2010.\u0026nbspBut Mr Zahawi\u0026nbspstill remembers how difficult it was to arrive in the country as a young boy, with no way to communicate.\u0026nbsp“You’re wrenched away from your friends and you come to a new country, you have to start all over again,” he says. “I sat at the back of the class, I didn’t want to get laughed at, trying to string the words together to make a sentence.”Language, he quickly understood, would be the key to moving ahead. “I worked out very quickly that if you communicate well, doors open for you,” he says.\u0026nbspI ask him whether he feels young people from Syria and Afghanistan trying to get to this country in search of a better life should be given the same opportunity. He explains that his family went through the weren’t asylum seekers, but\u0026nbspapplied for settled status through the immigration system to\u0026nbspset up a business in the UK. He believed that people who work hard should be allowed to come to the UK.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got a rigorous immigration system to do that,” he says. “We’ll be able to decide our own immigration policy post-Brexit. For genuine asylum seekers we should be welcoming.”Mr\u0026nbspZahawi backed leaving the European Union. “Brexit appeals to me for no other reason than I thought we could reform within the EU, but when that became undeliverable for David Cameron I reluctantly backed Brexit because I thought the direction of travel for the EU is not right for us.”He says he doesn’t believe the German people have bought into the so-called transfer union, in which wealth within the EU ends up supporting weaker southern economies. He also believes Britons\u0026nbspwould never back the idea of a European army, an idea loathed by Brexiteers, but also seen as highly unlikely: “We’re better off exiting and wishing them luck in their endeavours but securing a trade deal so that we have access to the single market.”He never set out to be a politician. But a chance encounter at university piqued his interest.\u0026nbsp“At the University College of London union, on the first week at university, there was a bloke handing out the Socialist Worker\u0026nbspoutside. It was thin and small and I politely declined his offer at which point he was so aggressive, I thought I would go and find out about what the other side thinks,” he remembers.He was elected Conservative councillor in Putney in 1994, where he remained until 2006. In the interim, he helped run Jeffrey Archer’s unsuccessful campaign for Mayor of London in 1998. He was selected by the local Conservative association for the safe Tory seat of Stratford-on-Avon in 2010 and was re-elected in 2015\u0026nbspand 2017.\u0026nbspAs a member of parliament, Mr Zahawi has voted for reducing the rate of corporation tax and against an amendment in parliament on homes under a certain rent limit being “fit for human habitation”, notable because he is reported to have spent £25m\u0026nbspbuying property around London for buy-to-let and commercial use.\u0026nbspHis success in property has come later in life. After university, Mr Zahawi started an estate agency, but the business suffered when the property market entered a downturn in the Eighties. Mr Zahawi and his business partners were forced to liquidate.“The lesson there was that you don’t know how hard it is to make money unless you lose money,” he says. “It’s well worth all of us remembering in politics that every morning, millions of people get up and start a business or work in a small business and we have to make sure we deliver for them. It really does matter\u0026nbspthat what we do here does not hurt them and their prospects.”Small businesses are expected to be hit hardest by the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Surveys show many businesses have already been affected. Business investment fell for four consecutive quarters in 2018 for the first time since the financial crisis, according to the ONS.\u0026nbspEighty per cent of businesses considered Brexit uncertainty to have already had a negative impact on their investment decisions, according to a survey conducted in October 2018 by the Confederation of British Industry. Falling numbers of migrants have created a squeeze among employers, with the manufacturing industry in particular facing the biggest worker shortage in 30 years, according to the British Chambers of Commerce.Are we heading for a softer Brexit next week?What exactly will be better for small businesses after Brexit? Mr Zahawi doesn’t pause for breath: “One, we’ll be able to trade with the rest of the world. Two, we should be able to trade healthily with Europe and continue to have that trade. And three we’ll have our own policies on immigration or any other issues delivered in the UK.”Despite the challenges of his work, Mr Zahawi says he pinches himself every morning to think that he has ended up where he has. “Look at me today, a boy born in Baghdad, now a member of parliament for Shakespeare and a minister in Her Majesty’s government,” he says. “This country is an amazing country, it really is.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write. That’s why, in an era of political lies and Brexit bias, more readers are turning to an independent source.

If you live in the UK you’re in danger of losing all your rights.\u0026nbspThe airline has warned in the past that it will, in effect, disenfranchise its UK shareholders if this country’s catastrophically stupid\u0026nbspgovernment tips us off the no-deal Brexit cliff edge.With the clock ticking down, its warning has gone from threat to reality, as with so much else in the quite astonishing political freak show.\u0026nbspRyanair passenger whose name autocorrected to Lukewarm faces £100 billRyanair’s Michael O’Leary wants a woman to replace him as CEORyanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe airline this morning announced that its board on Friday passed resolutions meaning that from the date of a “hard” no-deal Brexit, ordinary shares held by Britons\u0026nbspwill be classed as “restricted”.\u0026nbspWhat that means is that their holders, regardless of whether they are institutions or iniduals, will not longer be eligible to vote on company resolutions. They will thus be\u0026nbspdenied\u0026nbspa say on the appointment of company directors, including the CEO and chair, on deals the company might enter into, on the annual report, boardroom pay, on anything of consequence in fact.\u0026nbspThey will no longer be able to speak at or even attend the company’s AGM for as long as the shares are treated as restricted. Britons will also be blocked from buying any new\u0026nbspshares in Ryanair.\u0026nbspAt this point you might very well be asking how on earth can the company can do this.Well, Ryanair’s an airline, and under the rather arcane rules that exist around the world concerning airline ownership, it needs to be majority owned and controlled by EU investors to be able to fly around the bloc, which is where its majority of the business comes from.\u0026nbspTo ensure this remains the case in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the company has taken the step courtesy of the powers granted to its board by its articles of association.\u0026nbspIt is possible someone may attempt to challenge the move. But if the no-deal cliff edge crumbles they, and everyone else, will likely have bigger issues to deal with. So I wouldn’t get your hopes up.\u0026nbspThere is an interesting wrinkle to this. According to Ryanair’s most recent annual report, EU citizens held 52.8 per cent of the company. UK institutions and iniduals make up a significant proportion of that.\u0026nbspMuch of the non-EU part is owned by Americans via American Depository Receipts (ADRs) which are a specific type of paper that non-US companies sell to US investors and that are tradable on US exchanges.\u0026nbspSo in theory, EU shareholders could be in the minority even if its UK shareholders are stripped of their rights. It will be interesting to see how the company works its way around that one.\u0026nbspBut this being Ryanair, you would presume the company had considered the issue and worked out a plan.\u0026nbspRyanair is popular in with US investors because it is very low cost, and not overly fond of unions. Its directors won’t want to upset what has been a largely supportive part of its investor base.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Victoria.“Where possible, we will redeploy staff based at these stores to other areas within the business.”Mr Trowbridge added the chain now has new openings in its sights.He said: “In total, just eight store closures have been announced since the business was purchased.“We are now turning our attention to returning to profitability and moving forward.“Overall, this is now a period of growth

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

If you’re a creator of comic books featuring the adventures of super-powered, costumed heroes, that might be a difficult rule of thumb to apply. But perhaps not for Tom King. In Mister Miracle, from DC Comics, King and artist Mitch Gerads have created one of the most critically acclaimed graphic novels of the last year, and for the Washington-based writer, he drew on experiences that not a lot of other creators working in the field today have access to.King, 40, who was born in California, spent several years as a counter-terrorism officer for the CIA, working out in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s fascinating to think about what King saw and did, and how that later informed his writing. Obviously, I suggest, if he tells me too much about it he’ll have to kill me.\u0026nbspHe’s heard that one before, of course, probably more times than he can count. “No,” he says, with what feels like an oft-trodden out reply, “if I tell you too much about it, they’ll have to kill me.”Born to a film-writer mother in Southern California, King developed a love of storytelling and an understanding of narrative from an early age. During the 1990s he interned at the offices of the two big comics publishers, Marvel and DC. His ambition, though, was to become a lawyer\u0026nbspand he graduated from Columbia University in the year 2000, intending to follow this path. He started working for the Justice Department.And then came 11 September. Like everyone else in America, King was appalled and shocked and numbed. But he also knew he wanted to do something in response. So he went on to the CIA website and discovered that they were recruiting.“They were looking to bring in a new generation of operatives to serve in this new world,” he says. “They wanted people who were good at connecting the dots. I went in maybe hoping to get a job as an information guy, I took the psych tests, and ended up as an operations officer.”Created with Sketch.Mister Miracle: The critically acclaimed graphic novel in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photos by DC ComicsPhotos by DC ComicsKing worked out in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq for seven years, and the exact nature of his work out there is necessarily vague. When his wife fell pregnant with their first son (they have three children now) he knew he had a difficult decision to make.“The part of the job I loved was being overseas, out in the war zone, as bizarre as that might sound,” he says. “But I knew I didn’t want to do that and have a family. I didn’t want to be away from my wife and kid for a year at a time.”Returning to the US, King didn’t resume his plan to become a lawyer but instead turned to his first love, writing. But he wasn’t back in the world of comic books just yet… or at least, not quite. King wrote a prose novel, but about superheroes. A Once-Crowded Sky was published in 2012, to good notices. Writing about superheroes had regalvanised his love of comics\u0026nbspand opened the door for him to work at DC.His first gig was a series about Dick Grayson, the original Batman side-kick Robin who grew up and adopted a new persona, Nightwing. Co-written with Tim Seeley with art by Mikel Jannen, the series was the first time that King was able to draw on his CIA past, as the character quit the superhero business to become a spy.That led to more work, and to the series that first brought King to wider notice – and his first collaboration with Mitch Gerads, his Mister Miracle co-creator. Published in late 2015, The Sheriff of Babylon was a critically-acclaimed crime series about a San Diego cop who becomes a military consultant in Iraq\u0026nbspand has to solve the murder of a young local police trainee.More work followed, with King getting to write characters both classic and obscure, from Batman to the Omega Men for DC, and the Vision (the character played by Paul Bettany in The Avengers movies) for Marvel.Which led to King and Gerads working together again on what has become one of the most well-received comic books in recent years, earning plaudits from mainstream reviewers and publications especially… Mister Miracle.Mister Miracle is a character who was first introduced in 1971, created by the towering genius that was Jack Kirby for DC comics. Real name Scott Free (ouch. But it was the 1970s, and King and Gerads do a fine job of contextualising that), Mister Miracle is billed as a “super escape artist”, Houdini in a cape and mask and yellow, green and red livery. He’s always been one of those B-List characters, except to the most devoted fans, in terms of recognisability.But in an age where, thanks to the big comics companies mining their intellectual properties and breathing fresh life and mainstream appeal into characters formerly known only to the cognoscenti – s of the Galaxy, anyone? Ant-Man? Black Panther? Aquaman? Suicide Squad? – even the non-rabid comics fan seems more willing to accept stories featuring characters who aren’t Superman, Batman, Captain America or Spider-Man.DC cancels comic where Jesus learns from superhero after backlash Still, a super escape artist in a garish costume. Possibly limited scope there for anything beyond a series of set-piece daring feats, you might think. Which is possibly why Mister Miracle won so much praise by being one of the most literary and absorbing stories released by DC in some years.It opens with a shocking image… the titular character slumped on his bathroom floor, wrists cut and bleeding out over the tiles. Yes, it begins with a superhero attempting to commit suicide.“Scott Free can escape from anything,” says King. “So we thought… he’s going to keep pushing it, trying to escape from more and more difficult situations. And eventually he thinks, can I escape from death?”King and Gerads had wanted to work on another big series after the Sheriff of Babylon, and initially they pitched an idea for a Batman comic but focussing on two big villains, the Joker and the Riddler. However, the characters were already earmarked for a storyline in the main Batman comic, so it was vetoed. DC, however, threw them another option.Gerads says, “I got a call from Tom and he told me that we couldn’t do the Batman story. He said what would your second choice be, and straight away I said Mister Miracle.” Gerads pauses. “That’s absolutely true. And Tom said, well, that’s what they’ve offered us. And he sent me the pitch and the first line was, ‘Mister Miracle attempts suicide’.”Starting from that dark place, the story then expands out into an exploration of, really, the anxieties of living in the modern era. Scott Free is married to the unlikely-named Big Barda, and they are attempting to navigate the mores of family life in present-day Los Angeles. But Scott and Barda are also not of this Earth.Original Mister Miracle creator Jack Kirby dreamed up for DC comics in the 1970s a series of books that became known as the Fourth World, existing within the normal DC continuity of Batman and Wonder Woman, but also slightly apart from it. It focussed on two worlds, New Genesis, where the benevolent New Gods lived, and Apokolips, brutal realm of the tyrannical Darkseid. New Genesis and Apokolips are perpetually at war, and in a bid to broker peace, their rulers Darkseid and the Highfather agree to swap infant sons. Scott Free is the child of New Genesis, brought up in the hellish Apokolips, where he learns his craft and meets Barda, one of the fearsome Female Furies. Together they escape, and make a new life on Earth, but are called back into the war, which is where we find them in this story.Mister Miracle was originally released as a 12-issue monthly series, and has just now been collected into a single volume. But it was always meant to be read as a graphic novel. King says, “It’s like a Dickens novel, which were originally serialised. It’s meant to be read as one story.” He pauses. “Not that I’m comparing myself to Dickens, obviously.”The story is a mix of domestic life and the horrors of war. In one memorable scene, Scott and Barda fight their way over several pages through the terrors of Apokolips, holding a conversation as they do about redecorating their condo flat, building up to the tender moment – delivered as each character despatches bad guys in a sequence that looks like a platform video game – that Barda reveals she is pregnant.Mister Miracle is a very personal book for both King and Gerads. The sheer exhausting nature of war comes across in several scenes, obviously drawn from King’s experiences. And Gerads’ son was born right in the middle of him working on the series, adding extra dimension to the point where Barda gives birth.Gerads has also done artwork for Batman (DC Comics)It should be noted that comics are a very collaborative medium, and King and Gerads worked closely on the distinctive look of the story. The trend in comics these days is for big, break-out images, kaleidoscopic panels, imaginative layouts. With Mister Miracle, the team went for a nine-panel grid, most closely associated with the classic of the genre from 30 years ago, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen.That’s perhaps informed the mainstream success of Mister Miracle. It might be an odd thing to say, but reading comics is a learned skill, and not everybody gets on with the medium. A strict page design allows for easier digesting of the narrative. Gerads says, “Some people in comics think doing a grid like this must be very constricting for the artist, but that’s not the case. The magic with this is that you know exactly how the reader is going to read your page.”King likens it to “almost like three Charlie Brown cartoons on each page, three panels each, and everybody knows how to read those”.Aside from being a meditation on war and a domestic drama with dialogue that would satisfy any Netflix drama binge-watcher, there’s also a bigger storyline at play in Mister Miracle. To wit, is any of it actually happening? Is it all, in fact, the dream of a superhero who’s lying on his bathroom floor, his life slowly ebbing away?“Living life is full of ambiguities,” says King, perhaps a little ambiguously himself.Gerads is more forthcoming, and points out that Scott Free is in every single scene in the story. “We never leave Scott’s side in the entire book, we go on this ride with Scott through the story. Perhaps by the end Scott realises that it doesn’t matter if it’s real or not, because one way or another this is what he’s lived through.”It was announced last year that one of DC’s next big movie projects will be based on the New Gods world, with Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle In Time) lined up to direct. Rumours emerged in the last few weeks that Scott Free and Big Barda will actually form the central focus of the movie. Whether it will end up as an adaptation of this story, neither King nor Gerads could say, but if it does it could end up DC’s most interesting movie yet.King and Gerads are hatching another collaboration for DC, which they aren’t at liberty to discuss (though King drops the hint that there’s a clue within Mister Miracle as to what that might be) and in the meantime, King is writing for the publisher Heroes in Crisis, which deals with the post-traumatic stress disorder that could actually affect superheroes given the ongoing violence and battles they deal with on a daily basis.Does he find writing about the things he’s seen and experience during his time with the CIA cathartic? Or is it painful? Perhaps a bit of both, he says.“I think me writing about war has been more necessary than anything else,” he says. “War and the damage that war does has formed the basis for a lot of my work. I write to give my kids a better life and the best thing for me has been to draw on what I’ve done. But I think I might be ready to talk about something else, now.”Mister Miracle by Tom King and Mitch Gerads is out now and\u0026nbsppublished by DC Comics.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The woolly mammothThe last woolly mammoth populations died out just over 4,000 years ago, but the prehistoric giants\u0026nbspcould soon be back and plodding about just like they were during the\u0026nbspice age.Scientists in Japan claim to have taken a “significant step” towards bringing the extinct species back to life, after they transplanted cells extracted from the carcass of a mammoth into a mouse, where they subsequently recorded positive biological activity.The cells were taken from the 28,000-year-old mummified remains of a woolly mammoth, named Yuka, found in Siberian permafrost in 2010. The animal, which died when it was about seven-years-old, is one of the best preserved mammoths known to science. The team extracted tissue samples from the animal’s bone marrow and muscle, which they described as “well preserved”. They then began searching for cell nuclei remains. In total, 88 nucleus-like structures were collected from the muscle sample.Created with Sketch.Woolly mammoth found in Siberia to be displayed in Tokyo Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A 39,000-year-old female woolly mammoth, which was found frozen in Siberia, Russia arrives at an exhibition hall in Yokohama, south of TokyoThe snout of a 39,000-year-old female Woolly mammoth, which was found frozen in Siberia, Russia.

The team said following the procedure a “pronucleus-like structure budded from the injected … mammoth nucleus.”They also found possible signs of repair to damaged mammoth DNA.Despite the successes, the scientists did not observe the further cell ision necessary to create a viable egg, “possibly due to the extensive DNA damage in the transferred nuclei”.This marks a “significant step toward bringing mammoths back from the dead,” researcher Kei Miyamoto, one of the study’s authors told Japan’s Nikkei news outlet.“We want to move our study forward to the stage of cell ision,” he added, but acknowledged “we still have a long way to go”.Woolly mammoth DNA found in illegal ivory samples seized in CambodiaLast woolly mammoths on Earth ‘killed off by lack of water’Farmer digs up 15,000-year-old woolly mammoth in fieldMost mammoth populations died out between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the Kyttyk Peninsula of Siberia until 9,650 years ago.But the species survived for another 5,000 years on Siberian islands, which became cut off from the mainland by retreating ice following the last ice age. The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago – well beyond the dawn of human civilisation, but finally becoming extinct around the time of the construction of the great pyramids of Giza in Egypt. There is no scientific consensus on the chief cause for the creatures’ demise, but climate change significantly reduced habitable parts of the globe for mammoths, and they were also hunted by humans.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It’s aiming for a morning splashdown in the Atlantic off Florida’s coast, the final hurdle of the six-day test flight. Saturday’s launch and Sunday’s docking were spot on.\u0026nbspNASA astronauts have been stuck riding Russian rockets since space shuttles retired eight years ago. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year. SpaceX is aiming for summer.(For context, there\u0027s no way the US can do this at the moment: its hope was always the Space Shuttle programme, so when that was cancelled it was left without a way of travelling up and down. Now it has to rely on the Russian space agency, which it pays to take astronauts to the ISS.\u0026nbspIf this works, it could change all that, by completing a plan to let private US companies build the rockets and capsules that will allow them to fly to space again. So it\u0027s a big day for Nasa and space travel generally, as well as SpaceX.)We\u0027re not going to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspevery part of the mission because of a communications blackout.

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

If they had worked with us prior to our reforms, they would have found a very different organisation.Some of the criticism levelled at us over this period was very fair as change was overdue. We believe our pay structures are now fair, transparent to staff and stand very positive comparison with other organisations.The publicly-funded organisation said it had spent the last two years actively encouraging\u0026nbsppeople to come forward with questions over their pay - adding that many of these had been routine queries and they had now resolved more than 85 per cent of them.The BBC also said they had commissioned independent reviews which did not find systemic issues of pay discrimination but\u0026nbspidentified improvements to our pay structures which we have been making.As we have already acknowledged, we have some historic equal pay cases, they added.\u0026nbspWe are profoundly sorry for this. We regret the time it has taken to resolve all of the questions, but some of these are complex and have not been straightforward to resolve. We are determined to make progress on the remaining ones.The BBC apologised to Carrie Gracie, its former China Editor, last year after acknowledging that she had been underpaid for years in comparison to male colleagues and agreeing a\u0026nbspfinancial settlement with her.Ms Gracie had accused the broadcaster of discrimination and breaking equality law when she resigned from her role as China editor\u0026nbsplast year. She was offered the job on the basis she would receive the same as her fellow international editors – but later discovered the men received at least 50 per cent more.We’ll tell you what’s true.

This cannot be what was intended.”The committee said the cap should only apply to claimants who are either claiming jobseekers’ allowance or claiming universal credit and in the “all work-related” activity group.Veteran MP Frank Field, chairman of the committee, said: “It would be difficult to think of a more cruel cut.\u0026nbspBenefits are being cut with the aim of driving people into work, but four in five people bearing this cut aren’t expected to work.“What genius in government thought this one up?”The committee also called on the government to increase the cap levels in line with inflation and to do more to monitor the impact of it.The benefits cap was lowered in 2016 to a maximum of £23,000 for families and £15,410 for a single person living in London, and £20,000 for a family and £13,400 for a single person outside of London.The DWP said it would “carefully consider” the report’s findings and “respond in due course”.A spokesman added: “The benefit cap restores fairness so that it pays to work and still ensures there’s a safety net for the most vulnerable.\u0026nbspPeople receiving certain disability benefits are already exempt from the cap.”Work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd also announced yesterday\u0026nbspthat benefits claimants in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, had been chosen as the first people to be moved on to the government’s universal credit welfare reforms.Amber Rudd has set fire to her party’s own record.

Indeed we\u0027ve offered such reassurances on many occasions.\u0026nbspThe instrument agreed yesterday puts those reassurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous legal statement of what has been agreed. It does not reopen the withdrawal agreement or undermine the backstop or its application.May claims ‘legally binding’ changes to Brexit deal securedMr Varadkar\u0027s comments, pitched to his domestic audience that is worried about the strength of the backstop,\u0026nbspare likely to be unhelpful for Theresa May, who is trying to present last night\u0027s agreement as a major victory for UK negotiators that assuages the concerns of Tory MPs, ahead of a crunch vote on the plan today.The Taoiseach said he hoped the House of Commons backed the agreement, and that the additions would\u0026nbspeliminate doubt or fears, however unreal, that the goal of some was to trap the UK indefinitely in the backstop. He said Brexit was a dark cloud over us that a positive vote this evening could remove.The reassurances obtained by Ms May do not touch the actual withdrawal agreement, but instead take the form of other assurances by the EU that it will not seek to trap Britain in the backstop against its will. The fundamental functioning of the agreement has not changed, however – with the only legal way to escape the backstop permanently being negotiating a trade agreement that resembles membership of the\u0026nbspsingle market and customs union.The maths in Westminster is not on the government\u0027s side, with some Brexiteers having already rejected the plan, arguing it does not address their fundamental concerns. These\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspdo not want a permanent customs union with the EU, which they fear the backstop will become, and are worried about the imposition of checks on the Irish sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Created with Sketch.

The backstop keeps the UK inside an EU customs territory and applies some single market rules to Northern Ireland in order to remove the need for border checks. The current version of the backstop was demanded by UK negotiators after the prime minister said she could not accept an early proposal, which applied only to Northern Ireland.We’ll tell you what’s true.

This is, as has been widely stated, wrong, and her tweet has been deleted, but there is another side to the story which is more favourable to McVey.First, though, the actual facts. As things stand the UK and Denmark have an absolute exemption from the obligation to join the euro. This was the famous “opt-out” from the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which set in train the long process towards adopting the euro across much (though even now not all) of\u0026nbspthe EU. All the other member states of the EU in 1992 have now adopted the single currency some members that joined after 1992 and after the first wave of euro nations abolished their currencies in 1999\u0026nbsphave also adopted the euro – Slovenia in 2007, followed by Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014 and Lithuania in 2015.Altogether 19 of the 28 member states are members of the euro, including all of the largest economies except the UK. It has made trade and cross-border movements of money much smoother and made international pricing of goods and services more transparent, reducing business costs and adding modestly to economic growth.\u0026nbspHowever, despite this, others countries have not joined the euro, despite this being a formal accession treaty obligation once certain criteria are met. For example, Sweden, which joined in 1995, still retains its krona and shows little inclination\u0026nbspto adopt the euro nor, it seems,\u0026nbspare the European Commission and European Central Bank pushing the point.Should we purchase euros for a trip to Italy in April?By contrast other, weaker economies that might wish to ditch their own currencies in favour of the euro are not yet qualified to do so. The experience of Greece, which was allowed to join the currency probably before its economy was strong enough, has been instructive.\u0026nbspAs well as the UK and Denmark, other EU members still outside include Poland, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria.The problems with the single currency are well publicised, and have caused real economic harm and human misery among those countries that have\u0026nbspendured years of austerity to try and make themselves more competitive, andor pay for the banking rescues required after the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThat is why richer countries – which would be expected to bankroll the system – are wary of joining. The Greek example is why some weaker countries are also cautious about the disciplines imposed by the system, and why the richer countries are also disinclined to hurry them into the arrangement.\u0026nbspPresident Macron’s proposal for a “fiscal” union to complement the monetary union – effectively moving some macroeconomic decisions on overall levels of taxes, public spending and borrowing to the European level – have been rejected by Germany, which usually pays the bills (Finland and the Netherlands also chip in). So this inherently unstable system seems set to continue on its present basis.Whether the UK would be allowed its euro opt-out if it rejoined the EU in a few years’ time is impossible to predict,\u0026nbspbut it would not necessarily be granted.Where\u0026nbspMcVey and her cited journalist have a point is that the euro was originally regarded as essential to ensure a “level playing field” under the single market. Countries, in other words, cannot gain an “unfair” advantage by devaluing or “manipulating” their currency as a way out of their uncompetitiveness (usually stemming from poor productivity, high wages and too much debt).That logic applies as much today and in the 2020s as is it did in 1992. There may come a point when the political pressure on non-euro members to join the currency – whatever the legal formalities – would become so intense as to be unbearable. In that sense non-euro members states are always at long-term risk of being pushed towards the euro – but Denmark and the UK do have that strong international treaty protection in the final analysis.Equally, it is true that the euro might fragment long before such pressures on members to join\u0026nbspre-emerge. It seemed perfectly possible that it would collapse a few years ago. Today the precarious Italian public finances and banking system represent a mortal danger to the euro system, as the Italian economy is far bigger than Greece, and “too big to save”.\u0026nbspSo, in the end, Esther McVey and her critics might both be proved equally wrong.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The decision of the panel, which is meeting this morning,\u0026nbspis expected to be a highly significant in influencing other ERG members.The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, will also publish his\u0026nbsplegal opinion this morning\u0026nbspon whether the changes secured by Ms May have altered his previous assessment that the backstop could endure indefinitely.Many Tory MPs who opposed\u0026nbspthe deal in January\u0026nbspare waiting for those two rulings before announcing\u0026nbsphow they will vote tonight.\u0026nbspERG chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0026nbspsaid he wanted to hear the opinion of the group\u0027s legal star chamber before coming to a decision, telling\u0026nbspBBC Radio 4\u0026nbspToday: The reason we haven\u0027t jumped to a conclusion is that there is a lot of detail in this.

Ms May has promised that, if her deal is rejected a second time, she will allow the Commons to vote on whether to pursue a no-deal Brexit or delay Britain\u0027s departure from the EU.Urging MPs to back the plan, environment secretary Michael Gove told\u0026nbspToday: We have an improvement on the Withdrawal Agreement that was presented to the House of Commons in January. That improvement ensures that we have additional legal weight behind our position.It also ensures that, as in any agreement or any contract, if it is the case that one side - in this case the EU - seeks to act in a way that is not in accordance with their commitments then we can go to court and we can win.We have also made a declaration as a nation that, should the EU behave in that way, that is exactly what we will do.We’ll tell you what’s true.

So far, she has failed on both counts, with the EU 27 united in resistance to such efforts.\u0026nbspUnless the prime minister secures last-minute concessions this weekend, in an eleventh-hour dash to Brussels, many in Westminster expect the second “meaningful vote” to be resoundingly defeated too.\u0026nbspBritain does not want a long delay to Brexit saga, poll showsHowever, if parliament springs a surprise and her deal passes on Tuesday, Brexit will be secured – although\u0026nbspMs May would probably have to request a short extension to the Article 50 timeframe so that\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspcan\u0026nbspdebate and vote on key pieces of legislation that are required to be in place for exit day.\u0026nbspAssuming the prime minister does not win the day, the scale of defeat will be key.If it is similar\u0026nbspto January, it could be fatal for Ms May, who will undoubtedly face claims\u0026nbspthat she has wasted precious time in the last two months. Her deal will be considered dead.In this case, the prime minister would probably be out of options, and will be under considerable pressure to go down a softer Brexit route. This would risk\u0026nbspa potential\u0026nbspsplit in\u0026nbspher party while she seeks a majority for an alternative deal and effectively forms a parliamentary alliance\u0026nbspwith Jeremy Corbyn.Created with Sketch.

This would almost certainly require a short delay to the Brexit process.Mr Corbyn may also decide the time is opportune –\u0026nbspif Ms May loses badly –\u0026nbspto put down a second no-confidence motion in the government in an effort to force a general election, though\u0026nbspit still does not appear the Labour leader has the numbers in the Commons to win such a vote. \u0026nbspHe has also committed his party to backing an\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbspon a second referendum, so this could also be the week in which MPs finally test whether there\u0026nbspis a majority for such a path. The consensus is that there is not, and it may be that proponents of a further public vote on Brexit do not test the Commons just yet.Votes on no-deal and Article 50 extensionCrucially, if the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote” on her deal, she has vowed to hold two further votes this week: one on a no-deal Brexit (due to take place on Wednesday), and a second an approving an extension to Article 50 and delaying Britain’s exit from the EU (Thursday). This is where there might be fireworks.EU accused of ‘playing games’ in last-ditch Brexit negotiationsBanks ‘broke agreement to suspend Brexit campaigning’ after Cox murderCorbyn tells May second defeat for her deal is ‘the end of the road’EU says Britain can leave backstop but Northern Ireland must stayPound falls after May warns of ‘moment of crisis’ over BrexitIt has been clear for some\u0026nbsptime that there is no majority in the House of Commons for a disorderly (or “cliff-edge”)\u0026nbspbreak from the bloc. As such, it is likely that MPs will vote to take a no-deal departure off the table.The following day there will be a vote on extending Article 50, and it is anticipated\u0026nbspthere will be a majority for this course of action.Ultimately, it is up to the EU 27 whether to grant any extension: if they agree,\u0026nbspterms and conditions might easily be attached. They could, for example, demand a lengthy extension rather than the\u0026nbsptwo-month period preferred at Westminster.Ms May will have to decide whether or not to give her own MPs\u0026nbspa free vote on the contentious issue of the no-deal scenario. It is an incredibly isive topic among Conservatives, and throughout the negotiations,\u0026nbspthe prime minister has deployed the threat of a no-deal outcome. \u0026nbspIf the prime minister decides not\u0026nbspto give Tory\u0026nbspMPs a free\u0026nbspvote, and whips them\u0026nbspto keep no deal on the table, it could easily lead to a significant number of ministerial resignations from the Remain-leaning figures at the top of government who would probably rebel.\u0026nbspAs the prime minister herself said, reject the deal and “no-one knows what will happen”\u0026nbspbut what we do know is that\u0026nbspMs May is about to enter one of the most dangerous weeks of her time in office.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

It is this,” he said.In politics, sometimes you get a second chance. It is what we do with the second chance that counts.

The party says it will back a second referendum if it cannot secure these changes.But Mr Weber, who leads the European People’s Party in the European Parliament, said on Tuesday: “This is the last chance to reach a reasonable agreement on Brexit. There departure date cannot be postponed – a two-month long technical transitional period is the maximum we can accept.“Jeremy Corbyn and Labour should finally take responsibility for their country and support this compromise. Their purely tactical behaviour and electoral calculations are absolutely unacceptable.”Labour MPs urged to disregard PM’s ‘half-hearted’ Brexit pledgeBarring a major upheaval at the coming European Parliament elections in May, Mr Weber is likely to become the next Commission president, which would see him deal directly with the UK.The vast majority of Labour MPs are expected to vote down May’s Brexit deal at the behest of the leadership later on Tuesday, with just a handful defying Mr Corbyn and supporting the exit plan.Without Labour votes it would be very difficult for the Government to pass its Brexit deal – with many Tory Brexiteers still opposed and the DUP yet to come onside.Other EU figures have been more supportive of Labour’s position in recent weeks. Udo Bullmann, the leader of the socialist group in the European Parliament, praised Mr Corbyn in February after his party backed a second vote.“That\u0027s the announcement we were waiting for: Jeremy Corbyn’s plan or second referendum. UK Labour on the offensive,” Mr Bullmann said.EbS)European Council president Donald Tusk and others have also called on the UK government to consider Labour’s proposals for a softer Brexit in order to compromise and win their support.\u0026nbspTheresa May has refused to adopt any of the Labour proposals, however – for fear they would turn yet more of her MPs against her.If MPs reject the Brexit deal on Tuesday evening the will be asked to vote on ruling out a no-deal exit on Wednesday, and then whether to ask for an extension of Article 50 on Thursday.Though Mr Weber said the EU would only agree a short extension to Article 50, other EU figures have suggested a longer extension could be possible as long as it was in aid of a new policy or approach from the UK side.We’ll tell you what’s true.

And he has consistently pointed out that the original dream that gave rise to it is under threat.It is exactly 30 years since Sir Tim submitted a paper to his colleagues at CERN, suggesting a way of sharing data across networks,\u0026nbspunder the title “Information Management: A Proposal”. The humble title belies the importance of what was contained inside, which included a complete sketch for the networked information system that would on to become the internet\u0026nbspwe know today.That would take some time, however. It would take a year-and-a-half for the name “WorldWideWeb” to be proposed, and it would take many months before the public could actually access a public version of the web even then, it didn’t look anything like the rudimentary graphical pages we associate with the early internet, let alone the huge and complex system you and your computer have navigated to get to this article.That modern web has brought with it a series of technologies that would have seemed impossible and unimaginable at the time the web was first being proposed:\u0026nbspinstant streaming of just about any film you would like to watch and\u0026nbspinternet connections inside of fridges. But it has also brought with it threats, some of which could undermine the very fabric of the web itself.In 2017, when the web turned 28, Sir Tim laid out what he saw as the three challenges that threatened it. All of them are at least as pressing then as they were two years ago, and some were eerily prescient about the ways the web would develop.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe first warning was that “we’ve lost control of our personal data”. He noted that many websites run on a business model that lets users have free content in exchange for their personal data, which allows them to harvest vast amounts of personal information, which in turn can make the internet a dangerous place to retain any kind of privacy or to discuss important but sensitive topics.Inventor of World Wide Web calls for crackdown on fake newsSince Sir Tim wrote that message, the world was rocked by the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a whole host of other revelations about the amount of data being collected on private people and how it is being used.The second challenge he noted was that it is “too easy for misinformation to spread on the web”. Noting that “most people find news and information on the web through just a handful of social media sites and search engines”, he described how websites spreading hoaxes, and false stories can do so relatively easily, and that the system can be gamed to spread that even more quickly.Third, he said that online political advertising “needs transparency and understanding”. Such advertising is become incredibly sophisticated, he noted, and when combined with the vast amount of data companies like Facebook are tracking can make it very easy to manipulate those people who see it.The scandal over political advertising in events such as the 2016 election and the Brexit vote is still continuing, and campaigners still criticise the relatively limited transparency that has been introduced on platforms that claim to be looking to limit it.A year later, in 2018, he shared another set of challenges, which largely related to the fact that the world has crossed over the point where more people use the web than don’t. That brings a whole host of questions of access and openness, he suggested.The threats that are posed to the web still very much exist, he noted. “But I remain committed to making sure the web is a free, open, creative space — for everyone,” he wrote last year.By closing the digital ide and helping people get online, stopping the control of the web lying with a small number of very big companies, and by making the discussion around the future of the web more erse, he claimed those threats could be avoided.Sir Tim has been consistent in arguing that the web is really a communal endeavour – and calling on that community to help save it from the threats it is facing.“I may have invented the web, but all of you have helped to create what it is today,” he wrote in 2017. “All the blogs, posts, tweets, photos, videos, applications, web pages and more represent the contributions of millions of you around the world building our online community.”That was a vision that was present in the original proposals for the world wide web, begun 30 years ago today. There, Sir Tim described a vision of CERN staff on the web\u0026nbspas “several thousand people, many of them very creative, all working toward common goals”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its a fantastic opportunity to build understanding across communities and educate ourselves about our erse communities. Lets build bridges not walls.The Muslim Welfare House in London released a statement after the incident, saying it the attacker had shouted and hurled verbal abuse to the utter shock and disgust of all present.Toufik Kacimi, CEO of the organisation, said: We condemn in the strongest terms this outrageous act which has left everyone shocked.This disgraceful act by this inidual is a sign of the hatred and Islamophobia that sadly abound in our community.We will not let this deter us from cooperating with all groups in building a more cohesive society.Other Labour figures who have been also hit with an egg include ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband, as well as John Prescott, who went on to punch the protester.Last week Mr Corbyn confirmed that his party would get behind a second Brexit referendum, much to the fury of his pro-Brexit voters.But MPs in Leave backing seats warned it could cost the party their seats - and the next election."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sands-United-FC-team-photo-2018.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sands united football team grieving dads","story":"But behind their proud smiles, these men all share a secret - every player is a father who has lost a child - and the group play to support each other through their grief, both on and off the pitch.Sadly, the death of a baby is not a rare event and every  minutes in the UK – theof a football match - a baby dies shortly before, during or soon after birth.This is why each player has the name of his lost angel emblazoned on his shirt.It makes me feel like Im doing something for them. Im more motivated to score. We do it for our angels, player Kieran says.The team – which has over  players - was set up by Rob Allen, , after his baby daughter Niamh died in October  at  weeks and  days.While he and his we Charlotte, , had been told at weeks into the pregnancy that she was breach, they had no inkling anything was wrong.Then, days before she was due, a doctor told them there was no heartbeat - and they didnt know why. About one in three stillbirths are unexplained.Our walls just folded in, the carpenter and roofer recalls. It was a horrible, heartbreaking situation to be told that the child you had been planning to welcome home for so long, was not coming.To help him deal with what had happened, Rob started attending his local Sands - stillbirth and neonatal death charity-support group.Then the manager of an old league team he used to play for, Alan, suggested holding a football match to raise money for the charity.They recruited  players who had either lost babies, and raised £,.We saw that it had given those men an opportunity to talk about their experiences, Rob explains. And because everyone had got a huge amount out of it we decided to put the wires out and set up a permanent team.Because were playing in memory of our lost children, theres an extra drive - it gives us that little bit extra in the last  minutes of a game and makes us more of a unit than other Sunday teams who treat it as more of a jokey kickabout, dont mindthey win or lose and might turn up a bit drunk, he adds.Those who have signed up arent just men who have lost their own children, but include a player whose twin was lost at birth, and another whose sister lost a baby. They have very much felt the impact, explains Rob.Then theres those who have suffered from PTSD after nearly losing their partners as well as their baby during childbirth, and have experienced flashbacks and nightmares as a result. One had to seek further help because he was having suicidal thoughts, and his mind was telling him to join his baby.Were now in a time when there is more of a focus on male mental health, and encouraging men to talk and not bottle it up, says Rob. Thats where football comes in - it can feel accessible whereas sitting in a room and being asked whats your name  Whats your story  can feel daunting.The success of the club shows how much this service is needed. Theres already  people interested in starting their own Sands football teams around the UK, and theres been interest in the club in the UK, France, Belgium and Russia.Of Niamhs legacy, Rob - who has a five-year-old son Alfie and has also welcomed newborn daughter Iris - adds: Shes inspired me to do something that has helped local people, and is now touching those across the country and across the world.For Ross Coniam, , from Watford, who joined the team last year, the camaraderie amongst his teammates who have all experienced the loss of a child has been overwhelming.“Some men in the group lost children  years, others in the last one or two years but there’s nothing like being able to talk to someone who knows exactly what you’re feeling when you’re down and having a crap day,” says Ross, who lost his daughter Norah last May just hours after she was born. “It’s still such a taboo subject and some of my friends have never talked to me about it because they don’t know how - but talking about it does help.After a smooth pregnancy, Ross and his we Naomi were excited for the birth of their first baby and had no idea anything was wrong.“But as soon as she was delivered, there was panic,” recalls Ross. “Someone pushed the alarm bell and  to  people doctors piled into the room and started working on her because she wasn’t breathing. It took  minutes to resuscitate her and we knew it wasn’t good.”The baby was taken to the special care unit and hooked up to machines to help her breathe - but the doctors told Ross and Naomi there was no brain activity and there was nothing they could do.“It was so hard to take in,” says Ross. “She weighed lbs and looked absolutely perfect, with a gorgeous smattering of dark hair. After family and friends came to see her, we were taken to a side room so we could hold her for the first and last time.The doctors didn’t think she’d breathe more than a few seconds off the machines, but she lasted half an hour – it was a miracle.They named her Norah Faith, the middle name chosen there and then at the hospital when she was first taken away and there was still some hope. It is the name under the badge on Ross’s team shirt, over his heart, and the name at the forefront of his mind when he meets the team.“Not many people have been through what we’ve been through and it’s such a comfort having them there,” says Ross. “I go to Norah’s grave every week and read her stories like The Hungry Caterpillar, like I would have doneshe had been alive, and it can feel so painful and sad. Naomi is pregnant again now –  weeks – and it’s wonderful but I think I’ll be nervous until we’re out the other side.”Kieran Wright, , a warehouse worker from Northampton, understands all too well what it feels to be nervous about a pregnancy, after his fiancé suffered two miscarriages in two years.“She was eight weeks pregnant when she started to have severe stomach pains,” recalls Kieran. “We got to hospital and after a few tests they told us we’d had a miscarriage. It was so hard. All that good news and excitement about the pregnancy and it had all gone in the blink of an eye.For a while afterwards, I struggled to go to work and didn’t want to leave my fiancé. You can’t even say everything’s going to be alright, because it just isn’t.”The second miscarriage happened a year later in similar circumstances. “This time I could barely eat, didn’t talk. I was just in my own little world. I suppose I’d hit rock bottom, he tells us. We named them Casey and Dot.”He heard about a charity match Sands Utd were playing locally and spoke to Rob the founder and decided to sign up. “The first time I met some of the lads I preferred to listen to their stories than talk, but over time I did open up and let all my emotions out and I’ve never felt so supported, he says.After games we go to the clubhouse and we will talk through how were feeling - other times we will go round each others houses.They’ve since had a rainbow baby – Archie – who is now six months old. “If I feel down, he’ll just smile at me and I cheer up,” says Kieran.When a baby dies the feelings of loneliness and isolation can be overwhelming and having other bereaved parents to talk to is vital, and dads, especially, can sometimes be overlooked.This is why Sands is now working with Rob and the team to develop Sands United FC into a model that can be rolled out across the UK, so that more bereaved families can set up teams to channel their grief and help break the silence around baby loss.Already four new teams have been set up in Kent, Warwickshire, Leicester and Rutland and Grimsby and Cleethorpes and Sands United has a firm social media following, numbering almost  followers on Facebook and almost the same amount on Twitter and Instagram.To find out more about Sands Utd, visit sandsutdfc.

At this time, only four devices have been recovered.Police are now warning relevant businesses and sectors and the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious packages.They added no arrests have been made and Irish cops are also assisting Scotland Yard with the probe.Suspicious activity can be reported by calling the confidential phone line    or filling in a secure form at www.gov.uk act.

The EU thinks, with justication, that MPs won’t allow No Deal so it feels under no pressure to make signicant concessions.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is telling the UK thatit doesn’t like the backstop, it can have a Northern Ireland-only version of it — which the UK has already rejected. One minister fully briefed on the negotiations tells me: “We’re at ‘what the hell do we do ’ time.”But without a change to the backstop, Theresa May’s deal is going down to another heavy defeat on Tuesday.That won’t be the end of the matter, though. For the very next day Parliament will vote against leaving on March  with No Deal. Parliament will then almost certainly vote to request an extension to Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU.At this moment, the UK would be in the EU’s hands. As one weary No source admits: “They’d be in a position of being able to dictate terms.”It would be up to the EU to decide whether to grant an extension, how long it would be for and what conditions would be attached to it. How humiliating: This country’s future would be being determined in Brussels, not Westminster.The EU would almost certainly grant an extension. But what terms it would come with remains to be seen.What should worry those MPs who are voting against Mrs May’s deal because it is not a clean enough Brexit, is what Parliament would do with this extension. I understand that unless the Government indicates that it will allow the Commons to vote on ious Brexit options, an amendment will be tacked on to the extension vote to ensure that “indicative votes” are held.These votes would be on March  and the Commons would move to bind the Government to negotiate what it wants it to.Ministers would have to report back regularly to the Commons on the progress they are making. Mrs May might be in office, but she would not be in power. It is inevitable that the Brexit the Commons would mandate would be softer than Mrs May’s deal.So why, then, are so many Brexiteers not voting for her deal  Well, the problem is that many of them regard it as so flawed that they have no desire to rescue it. They would, in the words of one Cabinet minister: “Rather their hands be clean of all this.”But this isn’t PRACTICAL POLITICS. If Brexiteers won’t back Mrs May’s deal, then Brexit is ONLY GOING TO GET SOFTER.Is there any hope of avoiding this crisis  Today, it looks unlikely. But the DUP does want a deal.While they won’t accept the backstop as it currently is and were, in the words of one source, “not entirely happy” with the proposal Geoffrey Cox took to Brussels, they are eager for an agreement.If progress on the backstop was combined with a commitment from Mrs May that she would step down before phase two of the negotiations, then the deal might pass.I understand that a leading Brexiteer backbencher conveyed this message to influential figures in the Government this week. One normally loyal minister tells me: “If there’s nothing , that is the thing that has to work.”One outcome next week would avoid a crisis: Some progress on the backstop, Mrs May’s deal passing and a new PM coming in to do the next phase of the negotiations. All other roads lead to crisis.But right now, that is where we are headed.LABOUR will, officially, back a second referendum next week.But with as many as  Labour MPs opposed to the idea, it isn’t going to pass the Commons.Jeremy Corbyn has never been enthusiastic about a second referendum – he only backed one to prevent more defections to The Independent Group of MPs.Once he has gone through the motions of supporting one, he will feel free to pivot to other options.This was demonstrated by the fact he had a meeting with the Norway Plus group of MPs this week, who want the UK to stay in the EU single market.A soft Brexit has an obvious appeal for Corbyn. It would offer a solution to the issue while splitting the Tory Party.IT is now looking increasingly likely that the UK won’t be able to get anything on the backstop.“The EU are just not budging,” one of those intimately involved in the negotiations tells me.Bringing back a pretty much unchanged deal for a vote on Tuesday would lead to a heavy defeat for the Government, and probably by a three-figure margin.But there is another option being discussed in government. Gavin Barwell, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, told ministers this week that one option was to bring to the Commons the proposal that the UK has taken to Brussels. The idea would then be to try to win a vote on that, to prove to the EU that such a change would get the deal through.Right now, one Downing Street source says, there is a “chicken and egg problem” as the EU doesn’t think that what the UK is proposing would get the deal through the Commons, and so doesn’t see the point in engaging with it.Some in government think that doing this would offer a way out of the votes on No Deal and an extension that threaten to create the bitterest Tory split yet over Europe.This strategy is not without risks. It isn’t certain that the Government would win this vote. There is also a danger that holding a vote on a proposal that has been rejected by the EU would end up looking absurd.But walking into a vote knowing that you are going to lose heavily is rarely a sensible governing strategy.ON Wednesday, Alan Duncan urged the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, to have the Government whip against No DealMrs May’s deal is defeated next week.Duncan warned of an eruption from the “moderate” wing of the partythis didn’t happen. Barwell pointed out that Leave ministers have accepted a lot of compromises over the past few years.The exchange demonstrated how dficult the next week will be for the Tories. The votes that would follow Mrs May’s deal failing would make every previous Tory argument over Europe look like small beer.I understand the Government is looking to contain the row through a motion that would say the UK would not leave on March  without a deal, but would try to make clear that it was still an option after that.AS Mrs May was saying there was “no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers”, a leaflet from the Tories’ mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey was dropping on London doormats declaring thatthe party took City Hall they would hire , more police “Helping to bring an end to rising crime”.This pledge shows the position the Government has got itself into is politically preposterous.What is needed is more police to deal with the current crisis, then action to stop children from being drawn into these gangs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are almost there.”And he’s right.In the sneering words of ex-Whitehall panjandrum John Kerr, who devised the Hotel Calornia-style check-out-but-never-leave rules for Brexit, Britain has “come to heel”.Whatever emerges from the ashes of this week’s Commons votes, nothing can conceal the humiliation this country has suffered under Theresa May’s lock-jawed leadership.The PM has tarnished one of the jewels in the British crown — respect for this once-great nation in the eyes of the world.Thanks to her, a clutch of faceless EU bureaucrats and their feckless Tory allies have shredded the UK’s reputation for statesmanship and cool diplomacy. Great Britain — the world’s fth-largest economy, nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council — has been reduced to an object of international pity.Allies across the Commonwealth, America and even our erstwhile EU partnersare embarrassed to watch a great democracy grovelling before the unelected Burghers of Brussels.EvenAttorney General Geoffrey Cox s today with his famous cod-piece bulging, it’s lose-lose for Brexit.He might persuade enough Tory MPs to vote Mrs May’s botched and rebadged Chequers Deal through Parliament. But it will be at enormous cost.Barring an unlikely last- minute face-saver, Remainers have won this battle and the .million people who voted for Brexit have been comprehensively whipped.We can blame conspirators such as Tony Blair and ex-Chancellor George Osborne. We can point the finger at the BBC, Whitehall and a clutch of Cabinet plotters.We can blame the Brexiteers themselves for tripping over while stabbing each other in the back.And we can certainly blame Phil Hammond for blocking preparations for No Deal — our sole trump card in Brexit negotiations.But in the end, responsibility for this carnage lies with Mrs May. Indeed, thanks to her, Spreadsheet Phil can now bribe MPs with the £billion he saved by selling us down the river.If his chicanery succeeds, there is a remote chance Parliament will support Chequers and sign up to Brino — Brexit In Name Only. It will be a sour “victory”.History might be kind to Mrs May’s decency and her sense of public duty. But it will not ignore the catastrophic blunders which risk condemning this country to permanent vassal status.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt correctly warns Europe has just as much to lose. “This is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badlywe get this wrong,” he says.“We want to remain the best of friends. That means getting this agreement through in a way that doesn’t poison our relations for many years to come.”Stubborn as she is, Mrs May must know her days as PM are numbered.Losing three babies in quick succession is an unimaginable tragedy in any circumstances.In Shamima Begum’s case it underlines the recklessness of bringing children into the world of terrorist anarchy. Nothing Home Secretary Sajid Javid could have done in the few weeks since she emerged in public is likely to have saved her innocent child.The responsibility lies entirely with Shamima and her jihadi husband, Dutchman Yago Riedijk.There is no chance of her surviving what threatens to be disastrous spring council elections.Certainly there is no question of leading the Government into the next round of EU negotiations, still less risk another general election meltdown.Countless Tory supporters will risk letting Jeremy Corbyn in rather than vote for another May-led government.There is a deal to be had with pro-Brexit MPs who are threatening to inflict a final defeat on Chequers tomorrow.The consequences are unpredictable.If she promises to go by mid-summer, they will vote for her deal.

including in the UK.There are currently  in service with airlines around the world - but thousands more are on order.The model is one of four ieties of  Max aircraft produced by the US aerospace giant.Boeing says it has taken more than , orders for the single-aisle family of planes which can carry up to  passengers.In Britain, holiday operator Tui Airways has ordered  Max aircraft as part of a major fleet overhaul and took delivery of its first Max  in December.China Eastern AirlinesAir ChinaOkay AirwaysKunming AirlinesEthiopian AirlinesCayman AirwaysGaruda IndonesiaLion AirComairGol AirwaysAeromexicoAerolineas ArgentinasSilkAirTui was the first UK-registered airline to receive one of the new Boeing aircraft and plans to roll out its orders over the next five years.Based at Manchester Airport, the planes are due to ferry passengers to a range of holiday destinations from the north-west.The carriers German parent company is reported to have bought  Max s.Other airlines in Europe to use the Max aircraft include Air Italy, Lot Polish Airlines and Norwegian.The flight came down just after departing Addis Ababa carrying  passengers from  countries and eight crew members.Among those who died were nine British citizens, eight Americans and Italians,  Kenyans, nine Ethiopians, eight Chinese, seven French,  Canadians, one Irish, six Egyptians, five from the Netherlands, and four from India and Slovakia.The pilot, who had an excellent flying record, had reported dficulties and asked to turn back, adding the plane had no known technical problems.Senior captain Yared Getachew had a commendable performance having completed more than , hours in the air, an Ethiopian Airlines spokesman said.The plane had flown from Johannesburg to Addis earlier on Sunday morning, undergoing rigorous testing on February , the airline said.A horried witness said it swerved and dipped and was belching smoke from the rear before it crashed.He also said the Boeing  Max  was making a strange noise before hitting the ground with a large boom and a shower of flaming luggage.Crash investigators yesterday recovered the black box flight recorder from a crater the size of a basketball court.The harrowing final seconds of flight ET were revealed by flight radar data, which showed it repeatedly climbed, fell and climbed again soon after takeoffAviation experts said this unstable vertical speed is extremely unusual and planes usually climb steadily.Crash investigators from the US National Transportation Safety Board will arrive today to help piece together what went wrong, the US ambassador to Ethiopia said.The Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed today was carrying passengers from more than  countries, the airlines CEO told journalists.He said they included  Kenyans,  Canadians, nine Ethiopians, eight Italians, eight Chinese citizens, eight Americans, nine British citizens, seven French citizens, six Egyptians, five Dutch citizens, four Indians, four people from Slovakia, three Austrians, three Swedes, three Russians, two Moroccans, two Spaniards, two Poles and two Israelis.Belgium, Ireland Indonesia, Somalia, Norway, Serbia, Togo, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sudan, Uganda and Yemen each had one citizen onboard.Four of those onboard were listed as using United Nations passports and their nationalities were not immediately clear.It had been reported seven Brits were among the dead but last night two more were added to the toll.Victims include UN worker Joanna Toole, , from Exmouth, Devon, aid worker Sam Pegram, , from Penwortham, Lancs, Plymouth uni graduate Sarah Auffret, who also had French nationality, probation worker Joseph Waithaka, , of Hull, and Somali-born mum and son Sarah Hassan Said and Nasrudin Abdulkadir.

My view is that things have changed today and the amount of sugar children consume is out of all proportion to what they should be eating, and therefore the tradition is no longer acceptable.However, Tom Bosworth, Olympic race walker from Kent, criticised the head, saying: What is happening to society to ban kids from having sweets on their birthday.Ban them every other dayyou like, but let a child be a child on their birthday.Since announcing the birthday ban she has been called cruel and unsympathetic by furious parents.With around  children per class, sweets and chocolate were being handed out most weeks, something Ms Crawford-Usher said was out of control.Some parents are on board with the decision, while she explained that she had mums and dads telling her that they felt under pressure to comply with the tradition of bringing sweets for the class even though they didnt agree with it.Nearly , children under the age of five needed to have teeth removed last year because of their sugar intake.Ms Crawford-Usher who has insisted that shes not the fun police added: Children can eat and drink whatever they want when they get home, I just want to provide them with healthier choices at school.Children can eat and drink whatever they want when they get home, I just want to provide them with healthier choices at school.Ms Crawford-Usher said: It sets conflict at every level - the whole thing is just a nightmare for schools, and a nightmare for parents.Almost nine in ten hospital tooth extractions among young children are for rotten teeth and more are being removed now than  years ago - despite better dental care and knowledge."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475215950.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"parents ban vaping home cars e cigarettes kids","story":"They say theres a frightening trend where people think its acceptable to use e-cigarettes at home or in the car.One scientist warned the complacency is similar to how society viewed smoking  years ago.It marks one of the first scientic studies to gauge parents rules about e-cigarette use at home.Researchers at MassGeneral Hospital in the US found parents who vape are much more likely to allow e-cigarettes to be used at home or in their cars, compared with parents who smoke.Dr Jeremy Drehmer, who was one of the leads on the study, said: Our results suggest parents may perceive that it is safe to use e-cigarettes and are not taking the same precautions they do to protect their children from exposure to traditional cigarettes.This study shows that parents who are dual users of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes are much less likely to prohibit vaping inside their homes than to prohibit smoking.His team quizzed  parents across ten paediatric clinics across America, including vapers and smokers.They found just  per cent of e-cigarette users and  per cent of dual users had banned vaping at home and in the car.And  per cent of both e-cig users and dual users admitted people used the devices in their cars when kids were present too.Dr Drehmer said this was an alarming trend, and added: We are concerned that parents have been misled by the marketing of vaping products and now believe that the aerosol produced by these products is harmless to children.Paediatric health care providers need to help set the record straight and inform parents that e-cigarette vapour is not safe for children.Meanwhile, Dr Jonathan Winickoff, who led the study with Dr Drehmer, warned these attitudes are similar to those society had towards smoking decades ago - before the true dangers of tobacco were realised.He said: Frankly, its frightening. Its where we were with the exposure of children to combusted tobacco  years ago.Big tobacco markets e-cigarettes as healthy products without any consideration or warnings about the harms to infants and children.The truth is that all vape products create an invisible plume of nicotine and ultrafine toxic particles that spreads into the air and coats surfaces.Do people really want to wait another  years to see how this corporate experiment ends E-cigarettes are recommended by the NHS as a means of helping smokers quit their habit.The health service states the devices do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the main toxins in conventional cigarette smoke.But studies have found the vapour does contain other harmful chemicals, though at lower levels than cigarette smoke, the NHS states.It adds on its website: E-cigarettes are still fairly new and we will not have a full picture on their safety until they have been in use for many years.But according to current evidence... they carry a fraction of the risk of cigarettes.Last week another expert admitted he has banned his family from using e-cigarettes after his team found they increase the risk of heart attacks and depression.Other studies have shown flavoured e-liquids destroy lungand trigger deadly diseases.While other links have been found between vaping and the risk of stroke.So while they may be safer for smokers looking to quit, theres mounting evidence the devices are not harm-free.The new findings are published in the journal Pediatrics.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Others fooled Ed with fake sob stories.The presenter, , said: “I met some fascinating people with extraordinarily touching and heartbreaking stories.“However, some turned out to not be true and some of the untruths became worse the more they unravelled. It was quite an emotional rollercoaster.”One of the characters he encounters is -year-old Geoff, who claims to have been evicted from his home after spending months in hospital following a suicide attempt.Ed, a married dad of one, is drawn to his determination sweeping the streets around hotels and restaurants in Manchester while politely approaching people for change “for a bed for the night”.Geoff tells him: “I’m homeless but I’m not a tramp. I’m not a junkie.”Ed believes his new friend has “fallen through the cracks” and forms a bond with the young man, believing the pair could have been friends in another le.Geoff says: “I’d love to pay taxes. I’d love to have a house. That’s just not how it is for me.”But when his persistent “grafting” results in more than £ in just half an hour, plus another tenner shortly afterwards, Ed learns the money is not going towards a hostel — but hard drugs.Later preparing a potentially lethal “snowball” mixture of heroin and crack cocaine, Geoff justies his choice by claiming he buys drugs only once or twice a month.Having first tried heroin at , he adds: “I can’t afford to go to the pub and spend £, £ on beers, things that normal people do.“I can afford this. Whatever it is that I need to do to make my le bearable, then that’s what I’m going to do.”Unable to hide his disappointment, Ed concedes he has been “naive” to fall for Geoff’s self-pitying fabrication.At the start of the Channel  three-parter — called  Days On The Streets — Ed scavenges in bins for food and ends up chewing someone’s ’s old gum, found in a discarded salad box.He assumes le on the streets will leave him a bag of bones but is very much mistaken.In Glasgow he meets one homeless man who moans about getting TOO MUCH food.Ed said: “I witnessed  volunteers handing out food one night, and there were only two rough sleepers there. I even met one man who complained the public ‘overfeed’ him.”Ed gained lbs sleeping rough, thanks to the burgers and sandwiches given to him by the public.A blood test later showed he was at risk of heart diseasehe continued on such a high-fat diet.He said: “I was shocked by the amount of food available. I thought I was going to lose loads of weight and it was going to be harder to physically survive but there was an abundance of people wanting to help in all three cities.”Filming on his own phone and trailed by an unobtrusive camera crew, Ed met beggars earning hundreds of pounds in an evening, far outdoing taxpayers on minimum-wage jobs.A man called Mark tells him: “If I don’t make £ tonight, I’ll be gutted. I’m good at my f***ing job.”Looking back, the presenter said: “Begging seemed to be more lucrative than I ever imagined. It was common in London for people to make £ or £ in an evening, which is more than the average person earns in work.”Ed said he assumed “no one would want to be on the streetsthey had a choice” but found some of them would rather beg as it is easier than “navigating the benefits system”.For all the Geoffs and Marks sleeping rough on our streets, the plight and torment of others Ed meets is real.Dina, a mum of six, invites the presenter to spend a night in her temporary shelter in Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester, where she sleeps on two layers of cardboard, a sleeping bag and duvet.She tells of her previous le as a model for MS and Debenhams, and how she worked as an extra on Coronation Street.At , she was given a choice of whether to live with her strict dad, who was moving to Bristol, or with her drug-addicted mum. She chose the latter.Having spent two years on the street, she knows le could have turned out dferently for her.Dina, whose kids live with their father, says: “If I was pushed in the way a child should be pushed, in the right direction, I wouldn’t be sat here today. I would have made something of my le.”She sees her children but, crying, adds: “I can’t bring my kids here. If I was an asylum seeker, I’d have a house. This is my country, I was born here.”Dina is seen in the documentary acting in a motherly, protective way towards another female rough sleeper and tells a homeless man who asks her about drugs: “I don’t smoke it, you know I don’t.”The heartbroken mum chose the spot near a -hour Burger King because of its relative safety — but Ed flees when a bloody fight between some men breaks out nearby.When he s later, to find no trace of Dina’s shelter, he is told it was removed by waste collectors.Dina was not there to tell them it was her bed.During his relatively brief taste of sleeping rough, he kips in a doorway that is more like a public toilet and hears stories of homeless people being urinated on as they sleep.Some have had their sleeping bags slashed or set alight.Despite waking one morning to find his own bag had been soaked by a street cleaner, and being forced to wash himself with water from a toilet after a week without showering, Ed conceded even he could see how people were drawn into a le without rules.He said: “Sitting up against a wall, observing people, not having to follow any rules, it’s kind of what I do now. People talk about getting slightly addicted to the freedom, to the outdoor living on the streets.“You can do whatever you like when you like. You have got the fresh air, the social interaction with other homeless people. You get used to it.”Ed said the two months he spent on the streets were “surprising and shocking on almost every level” and added: “Some things were easier than I expected, such as finding food.“It turns out that there’s plenty of food on the streets for rough sleepers, especially in London.”Despite there being “a real sense of community” among some of the homeless people he met, Ed came away feeling “quite cynical” — although emphasised that behind each rough sleeper is a tragedy.He said: “I wouldn’t give directly to homeless people any more, sadly. I think there is plenty of food available for them, and so a lot of any cash they get is spent on drugs and alcohol.“I don’t believe the solution is cash handouts but I do believe they need a great deal more support and help than they are currently getting, to escape their situation.“I worry that the public enables their lestyle to some degree, with all their generosity.” Days On The Streets is on C on Thursday at pm.A Salvation Army spokesman said: “We applaud the generosity of the public in wanting to help people directly, but we recognise that providing cash can trap people in the endless cycle of homelessness and rough sleeping.  Many homelessness charities, including ours, focus on looking at the root causes of homelessness. Donating can help us with our work.”Cemal Ezel, CEO of Change Please, an organisation that trains homeless people as coffee baristas, said: “There needs to be a balance. If it’s a freezing cold night and by donating a few pounds that person can get into a hostel, it may save their le. However, on the whole not every night is freezing so some people use cash donations as an enabler. We try to help people through giving them a job and working their way out of the problem. We found  per cent of homeless people can work and want to.”Paul Noblet, head of public affairs for youth homelessness charity Centrepoint, said: “The decision as to whether to give homeless people money, food or other items should be a matter of personal choice.  If a young person is sleeping rough, the priority must be to get them into safe accommodation.”Stephen Robertson, CEO of The Big Issue Foundation, said: “Rough sleeping and begging are separate issues.  It’s reasonable to recognise that there seems to be, from anecdotal data, a growth in beggars and that leads to a moral and humanitarian question.  Ultimately, the answer lies with the inidual.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

MPs will hold their meaningful vote at pm on the -page pact she reached with the EU. Two months after her deal fell by a record defeat, and just  days before were supposed to leave, Mrs May will give Parliament a chance to have the final say. Last night she made a frenzied final dash to Strasbourg where she came up with a final offer.But she still faces defeat after several Tories and Labour rejected it. That would lead to a vote on No Deal Brexit tomorrow night followed by a vote on delaying Brexit on Thursday.The Commons chamber was packed past pm last night as MPs traded angry recriminations over the last-minute deal. Here are the five quick things you need to know as you wake up and go to work.  Theresa May last night claimed she had won legally binding changes to her plans after MPs demanded a change to the Irish border backstop.The backstop is an insurance clause that would keep the UK in EU customs rules from ,there is no agreement to keep the Irish border open. MPs feared the EU could use the clause to trap the UK in the backstop, holding the country to ransom in trade talks. So the UK and EU agreed a “joint interpretative instrument” to -page deal that, Mrs May claims, would provide a mechanism for the UK to quit the backstopthe EU is showing bad faith. It will give a key role to an arbitration  - who will hear appealsthe UK feels the EU is trying to keep it in the Northern Irish backstop against its will. Separately the new deal commits the parties to coming up with alternative arrangements by December .  In January Theresa May vowed to win “not a further exchange of letters, but a signicant and legally binding change to the withdrawal agreement.” She hasnt done that. The documents she has published are in addition to the -page agreement. They dont change its contents. Theresa May also promised to seek either a time limit, a unilateral exit mechanism, or alternative arrangements to the backstop. She hasnt done that. There is no time limit, and alternative arrangements are a future hope rather than being in place now. As for a unilateral exit mechanism... she may claim she has got it, but MPs will say dferent. It only worksthe UK can prove the EU is trying to trap us in the backstop against our will. And thats very subjective. Even Mrs Mays own statement to Parliament today admits her new deal “reduces the risk of being held in the backstop. It doesnt eliminate it. Labours Keir Starmer says its basically the same deal. . MPs look like theyll still vote against  While Remainers branded it a fig leaf, some Tories wafted over to back the Prime Ministers deal overnight. But thats nowhere near the  people she needs to change their votes from no to yes to pass it. And the DUP, whose votes are crucial, said they would judge the PM by her promises in January - which she hasnt kept . Labours Keir Starmer said it was a pile of broken promises. Remain-backing former attorney general Dominic Grieve told the BBC: “It doesn’t allow the UK the right to terminate the backstop at a time of its own choosing. Ultimately I dont think this document thats been produced makes any signicant dference. Brexiteer Tory ringleader Steve Baker said: I think this falls very far short of what the government whipped us to vote for. And his right-wing comrade Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was “unquestionably a step in the right direction,” but would not commit his vote. Even Iain Duncan Smith, one of the more hopeful-sounding Brexiteers, urged the PM not to rush things through and said she should delay the vote by  hours.  Before .am today, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will publish his legal advice on the Brexit deal. MPs will scan his text keenly to seeit agrees the deal meets with promises by the Prime Minister. If he does, it will give many Tories political cover to back the deal. But even then, it may not be enough for Theresa May to win. Hard Brexiteers fume that Mr Cox was also involved in negotiating the deal - so hes marking his own homework. Labour are demanding he make a separate House of Commons statement at .pm, before the main debate on the Brexit deal kicks off this afternoon.. Oh, meanwhile, the City is planning a Brexit war room The Financial Conduct Authority has plans in place for a financial war room to take action in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It will oversee the necessary IT changes to keep Britains banking sector operationwe crash out without a deal. An FCA spokesman said: As part of our planning for all scenarios we have put in place contingency measures in the event of a hard Brexit. We will have teams in place throughout the weekend of exit to monitor the situation and respond as needed, working closely with the Treasury and the Bank of England.

UKIP has polled at almost % for much of the decade and won the  European Elections. Their core purpose - their very reason to exist - is to ensure Britain leaves the EU. This was a big moment for them. Perhaps the party’s biggest moment since their referendum night victory. The tweet read: “PATRIOTS SUBSCRIBE TO PEWDIEPIE” Those of you who are familiar with science fiction will be aware of alternate realities and parallel universes. They’re plot devices often invoked in order to liven up a franchise which is under threat of going stale. The characters you know and love are all present, but there’s a twist. Up is down, left is right. Some detail is dferent, with entertaining results. In Star Trek, you have the Mirror Universe, where Spock has a goatee and people eat Kelpians for lunch.   Marvel Comics has dozens of parallel worlds. In some of them, Spider-Man is a cartoon pig. Perhaps most famous is Back to the Future Part II, in which a tiny change to history makes Bf Tannen a billionaire and turns Hill Valley into Vegas on crack. Most people assume we live in the prime timeline - the one where everything is normal and as it should be. I have long suspected we are living in an alternate timeline. This is the Banter Timeline - where all the things that were supposed to happen don’t, and are replaced by the most objectively hilarious alternative. It was created when a bored London student in the mid-s said to a friend: “Wouldn’t it be funnythat posh blonde bloke off of Have I Got News For You was mayor of London ” And the universe said “Yes. Yes it would.”   “Tell you what, itd be a laughBrexit won, wouldnt it ” “Yeah, and how aboutDonald Trump had a hit TV show ” “The guy from Home Alone   Dream big, my dude. Let’s make him President of the United States.” “Amazing. Now, who’s the most entertaining person we can get to be leader of the Labour Party ” It’s certainly endearing that there are still people out there who believe Brexit is all going to be resolved with some kind of sensible deal, which sees Britain set sail as a buccaneering independent coastal nation. But we’re in the Banter Timeline. In the Banter Timeline, only the most darkly hilarious outcome is possible. Lets face it, weve already had the Attorney General yelling BOLLOCKS at prominent TV news anchors this morning, so I dont know why youd expect anything more sensible from the rest of the day. Of all the plausible outcomes of this evenings vote, Theresa May’s deal getting another embarrassing drubbing from MPs certainly has the most comedic potential. Beyond that, only the god of banter knows what delights are in store. Perhaps MPs will plump for no-deal in their vote tomorrow, plunging us into a Mad Max-style apocalypse, where all there is to eat is freeze dried fish from bags.   Or maybe the most banterric outcome is for MPs to block no-deal AND block an extension to Article  in upcoming votes, leaving us in some weird limbo state. Maybe the Queen will get involved. Maybe Jacob Rees-Mogg will be Prime Minister come June, and will have passed a law demanding a butler on every street corner by Christmas.

The former Director of Public Prosecutions swept into full lawyer mode as he held aloft hundreds of pages of documents in a furious attack. He spoke after Theresa May jetted to Strasbourg for a last-ditch deal with the EU to persuade MPs to vote for her Brexit deal tomorrow night. Her deputy, David Lidington, told MPs the government had secured legally-binding changes that strengthen and improve the -page Brexit deal. He said a new joint instrument will prevent the EU trapping the UK in the Northern Ireland backstop - a clause that would extend EU customs rules over the UK - indefinitely.   And there will be a joint statement supplementing the future political declaration on trade setting out a negotiating track for changes to the Irish backstop. But Mr Lidington prompted shouts of uproar when he said MPs must now back the deal... to avoid a crisis. Jeremy Corbyn insisted that her negotiations had failed and called on MPs to reject the deal. And Sir Keir shot down Mr Lidingtons argument by saying Theresa May had promised to change the Brexit deal itself - and achieved no such thing.  Waving a fat wad of legal papers, Labours Shadow Brexit Secretary asked: Is a single word of the Withdrawal Agreement dferent now to the document that was agreed on November   He added: It sounds again asnothing has changed. Andthat is right, the Prime minister is left with a pile of broken promises. Its as much a matter of trust as substance. Sir Keir branded the situation absurd and made a cruel joke at the Cabinet Office ministers expense.  I don’t complain for not having advance notice of his statement, he told MPs. I’m not sure HES got advance notice. Sir Keir said MPs will be disappointed but not surprised. He said Labour would examine the plans, but boasting of signicant change when just repeating a January statement is not going to take anyone very far. Theresa May, speaking in Strasbourg, said the deal would honour the referendum result and is good for both the UK and the EU. She said she had secured legally binding changes to the Irish backstop.  But Labour MPs lined up to savage the new arrangement. Wes Streeting tweeted: Sat in the Chamber genuinely stunned by the futility and incompetence of the Government’s statement. We’re days away from exit. This is just smoke and mirrors. Labour MP Tracy Brabin added: Late night statement and still no wiser. He’s saying words but none seem to make sense. The new letter agreement isn’t part of the withdrawal agreement we will be voting on tomorrow.

Mrs May claims shes secured legally-binding changes that ensure we wont be trapped indefinitely in the backstop - a clause that could extend EU customs rules over the UK. But how does it compare to what she actually promised  Here is a quick guide.  Two things. Firstly, she promised a signicant and legally binding change to the Brexit deal itself - not, as shes presented today, some extra papers around it. Secondly. she said she would seek either a time limit, or a unilateral exit clause, or alternative arrangements to the Irish border backstop.On January , Theresa May told MPs: What I am talking about is not a further exchange of letters but a signicant and legally binding change to the withdrawal agreement.Negotiating such a change will not be easy. It will involve reopening the withdrawal agreement - a move for which I know there is limited appetite among our European partners. But I believe that with a mandate from this House... I can secure such a change in advance of our departure from the EU.  Three things: A legally-binding joint instrument which reflects a commitment to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December . The UK could go to an arbitration body to get permission to exit the backstopthat body agreed the EU was acting in bad faith to try and keep us in the backstop. A joint statement to go alongside the political declaration, which ministers say seeks to enhance and expedite the process of bringing the future relationship into force. A unilateral declaration on the temporary nature of the backstop, which will sit alongside the Withdrawal Agreement. This says that it is the UKs understanding thatthe EU doesnt keep up its end of the bargain in the future relationship negotiations, Britain can pull out of the backstop on its own.  Theresa May said her plan will involve reopening the withdrawal agreement. But she hasnt done that.Instead, she has secured three documents which are additional to the -page Brexit deal.Irish premier LeoVaradkarmade clear today that they did not reopen the withdrawal agreement or undermine the Irish border backstop. . A time limit on the backstop  She hasnt done it. Under the plans outlined last night, the Irish border backstop is not time limited. The deal commits both sides to work speedily on an agreement that supersedes the backstop by  December , but that is not a guarantee.  The deal does provide a way to exit the backstop. But its really long-winded, and only worksthe EU is deemed by an independent  to be intentionally showing bad faith. This is really hard to prove. Under the deal, both sides have agreed itll be a legal breachthey act with the objective of applying the backstop indefinitely. If the EU is doing this, the UK can seek a legally binding ruling that says so by an arbitration  under a dispute settlement mechanism.If the  agrees with Britain,and the EU continues to ignore the ruling persistently, then there might be something called temporary remedies. Onlyafterthat, ultimately, the aggrieved party would have the right to exit the backstop. We havent got these. Yet. Instead the deal commits both sides to try and find them before  December , which is when the backstop would kick in. The agreement says both sides commit to working speedily on a subsequent agreement that establishes by  December  alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be triggered. But thats not a guarantee. There would be a negotiating track to help this happen and a high level conference at least every six months. But thats simply not the same as a cast-iron pledge in law. And in Theresa Mays own words...  The Prime Ministers statement to Parliament today basically confesses her deal doesnt go far enough.She says itreduces the riskthe UK could be deliberately held in the Northern Ireland backstop indefinitely.That, you will notice, is not a guarantee. We can reduce the risk of England losing in the group stages of the next World Cup, but it doesnt mean theyll win - in the final.

The public will rightly be concerned that British airlines are refusing to take them out of service, after Sunday’s accident in Ethiopia and an earlier one off the coast of Indonesia. Safety should be paramount in the aviation industry, which is why international air accident investigators are anxious to discoverthe two crashes were a grim coincidence or evidence of a more widespread problem. We are not prejudging the inquiry’s outcome.   But when Ethiopia, Indonesia and China are among the nations grounding the jets, surely erring on the side of caution is the right choice. US manufacturer Boeing will have to co-operate fully and allow its performance records to be examined. It is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to people’s lives. Brexit caution Last throws of the dice are rarely as theatrical as Theresa May’s dash to Strasbourg for Brexit talks last night. She’s desperately searching for a solution that forces hardline Tories to start backing her bad deal. But our country will pay the price. The truth is that May’s poundbillion EU orce would be an expensive, avoidable disaster. MPs should hold their nerve, refuse to be panicked, reject her poor offering and vote for extra time to find an answer that is best for Britain.  A growing chorus of Tories are demanding that she quit, but May is prioritising her own position over the national interest. And that isn’t leadership – that’s putting herself first. Halt kne sales Stopping the sale of terrying “Rambo” knives – popular among some gang members – is a small but signicant step towards reducing street violence. We have consistently argued that there’s no single, simple answer to halting stabbings, but fewer weapons is surely part of the solution.

After getting married the following year, we knew we wanted a baby so started trying right away. But things werent really going to plan and after a year, we still had no luck -so we turned to IVF. Then came another blow. Our first attempt hadnt worked, but we were so desperate for this baby - we knew we had to try again. There was a lot of love and determination for it to happen. Eventually, our dreams came true and we were told I was pregnant in April last year. We were totally overjoyed - overwhelmed almost.   For the next week, I took around five or six pregnancy tests a day - just to prove to myself it was real. It seemed too good to be true. But with the joy, came worries that somehow the baby would be harmed. Would they survive  Is everything going OK  Will the next scan go well  You ask yourself a lot of questions. Despite our natural fretting, the next  weeks were magical. We were excited to meet this little person who was all ours. We never imagined our bundle of love would come packaged just a tiny bit dferent. The devastation hit four days after the -week blood test.   I was at work and a call from the doctor sent me flying from my desk - I couldnt even look or talk to my colleagues. The pain was immediate. Josh came home too, and we sat there in shared devastation at the news our baby would have a % chance of Downs Syndrome. Those first few days can only be described as a grieving process - we grieved for the baby we thought wed have and the magical pregnancy we had been enjoying. This happens to other people. How can this happen to me  were my honest feelings and thoughts at the time. It was an unreal time, but one I am glad to have experienced. After days of feeling hopelessly down, we started thinking back over the previous weeks, when we were giddy parents-to-be.   So we picked ourselves up and contacted our local Downs Syndrome foundation - who were a huge support. We were visited by people from the Downs Syndrome community and met some amazing and inspiring iniduals.I started to immerse myself in groups - from Facebook pages for support to local groups of expectant mums with the same diagnosis as my baby.While I was embracing this new path, I still found those next three months of pregnancy hard at times. I was sometimes afraid to talk to people about my bump and open up about my baby - I was worried Id get pitying looks or people wouldnt be as excited for me as they would other mums. But other than the ferocious love I already had for my baby, a glimmer of hope came in another, more unusual, form.  After the initial test, we were advised to go for a second, which would give a % accurate diagnosis. Josh and I decided this was the best option. We didnt want people telling us there was still a chance she would be fine and that it might not be right. We wanted to know exactly who our precious daughter was and doing so really helped us fall back in love with my pregnancy again. After the final test, which officially confirmed Gwendolyn had Downs Syndrome, we were handed three leafelts. Termination, Adoption and Keeping your Baby. It was a lot to take in, but something struck us. As we read the literature on adoption, we learned there was a huge waiting list for people wanting to adopt babies with Downs Syndome. People were actually waiting to adopt my baby - and it hit me how precious and valued these children really are.  The rest of the pregnancy was normal and we loved seeing her wriggle around on scans - we were desperate to meet her and hopelessly in love. At  weeks, doctors said my placenta wasnt ing so well - another common effect of the extra chromosome. We were told wed be meeting our little girl that very same day and I got booked in for an immediate C-section. The first sight of our little Gwendolyn was breathtaking - all lbs,  ounces, of her. She was tiny, but perfect. With her being a smaller and premature baby, we had to leave her in hospital for a week as nurses monitored her feeding before allowing us to take her home. Staying away from her was so hard, we eventually began staying at her side in the night.  In the days wed go to baby school, as we nicknamed it - where nurses and doctors told us how to feed her and care for any needs she may have. When we finally took her home, it was magical. We had the baby wed dreamed of for so long. The road to getting there hadnt been what we expected, but we had our sweet Gwendolyn to show for it. Today, Gwendolyn is a healthy and happy baby. But weve been told she may need surgery at six months old to help with a heart canal defect. Still, she doesnt let it bother her - she loves her food and shes so engaged and happy. Looking back at my journey to this point, I think it was important to grieve after first receiving the news about Gwendolyn.

MILLION.The Edwardian home in Chiswick appears dirty, dusty and dilapidated in these photos. But the spacious property boasts five bedrooms and three reception rooms. There are , square feet of space. The home has period features, large windows, high ceilings and a decent-sized back garden.For the past  years it was owned by the same person, a retired railway engineer who passed away in , My London reports . And the house has been practically untouched during his ownership - giving the next owner the opportunity to put their personal stamp on it. Despite its rundown condition, the property has been put on the market for the sky-high sum. This is eight times the average house price in England and Wales and almost four times as much as a typical home in London.   Savills, which is marketing the property, estimates a poundmillion overhaul could transform it into a stunning modern home worth around pound.million. Euan Rollo, from Savills’ Chiswick branch, said: I’ve worked in [this business] for over a decade and I’ve never come across a home as unmodernised as [the one in] Airedale Avenue. It has to be one of the last remaining opportunities to redevelop a home in one of West London’s most desirable streets and since launching [on Saturday] we have already received signicant interest and enquiries.   It’s the type of home that could have widespread appeal but particularly with the family market, be it locals or those coming from Central London who are looking for a long-term home with the space theyc need that’s close to good schools and Chiswick’s lestyle offering. Savills estimates approximately  to  per cent of properties along the street have had basements or loft extensions. The house is being offered as a probate sale and the Land Registry does not keep records for sale prices in the s and s.  However, the average home in England in  cost around pound,. The current asking price for the unmodernised Chiswick home is , per cent more. A similar home on the street, which was extended and meticulously refurbished, was sold last year by Savills for a guide price of almost pound.million.  Mr Rollo believes, subject to planning,the buyer spent around poundmillion on a basement build, full internal refurbishment, wrap-around extension and loft conversion the home could be worth around pound. to pound.million. He added: Properties like this do not come up often. It was under the same ownership for  years and it’s incredibly exciting to be in a position to find a buyer who’ll take it into the next phase.

The family would later claim they saw him carrying a girl, wearing pink and white pyjamas, down a quiet street around m from the beach. And US criminal profiler Pat Brown believes the sighting is the key in Madeleines case, which has yet to be solved more than a decade on. This is the number one issue about the whole case, and Ive stuck by this for years, and I stand by it today, she told  News in a podcast. Madeleine was just three when she vanished from an apartment in Praia da Luz, where she had been sleeping with her twin siblings.   At the time, her parents Kate and Gerry were dining with pals nearby.The reported sighting by the Smiths was at around pm on May , . The same night, a friend of Kate and Gerry also reportedly saw a dark-haired man carrying a child away from the direction of the apartment.But this sighting, by Jane Tanner, was reported to be  minutes before the Smiths one and was in a dferent location, the news site reports. Jane claimed she had gone for a walk when she saw, in the darkness and from some distance, a man carrying a child across the road ahead.“What makes the Smith sighting very interesting is that Jane Tanner is a friend, and the Smith sighting is a bunch of people that have no clue who the McCanns are, Pat, from Washington DC, says in the Maddie podcast.   These are not their friends. She adds: I believe the Smith sighting occurred. I believe they saw a man carrying a little girl down that road, which is towards the beach. E-fits of a suspect, based on evidence from holidaymaker Martin Smith and his family, were unveiled years after Madeleines disappearance.Meanwhile, an artist drew an impression of the so-called Tannerman - the man spotted by Jane, who was considered a suspect for years. Pats comments are made in the third episode of the podcast, which looks into the high-profile case and the two sightings that night.According to  News, the criminal profiler has studied the case in exhaustive detail, even flying out to visit Praia da Luz itself. Madeleine would now be , turning  in May this year.In November , Operation Grange, the Met Police investigation into her disappearance, was given a further pound, from the Home Office. This provided funding up to March  this year. The podcast is hosted by Australian journalist Mark Saunokonoko. A Netflix documentary about the case is set to be broadcast next month. Kate and Gerry earlier released a statement about the Netflix show. They said: We are aware that Netflix are planning to screen a documentary in March  about Madeleine’s disappearance.  The production company told us that they were making the documentary and asked us to participate.We did not see and still do not see how this programme will help the search for Madeleine and, particularly given there is an active police investigation, could potentially hinder it. Consequently, our views and preferences are not reflected in the programme. We will not be making any further statements or giving interviews regarding this programme.

Kate and William werent far behind them and the two royal women had a sweet reunion when they met inside the beautul abbey. They kissed each other on both cheeks, and both women did the same to their brother-in-law, just as Prince Charles and Camilla arrived.  Meghan wore a cream Victoria Beckham dress featuring a locks and chain pattern, teamed with a chic hat and green suede heels. Kate opted for a bright red knee- button down coat, beige heels and a Gina Foster hat.  The Queen looked lovely in purple with a stunning silver jeweled broach. She praised how the Commonwealth inspires its member states to find ways of protecting the planet and it citizens. In a written message, the monarch said: In April last year, I welcomed the leaders of our  nations to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and we all witnessed how the Commonwealth vision offers hope, and inspires us to find ways of protecting our planet, and our people.  We are able to look to the future with greater confidence and optimism as a result of the links that we share, and thanks to the networks of co-operation and mutual support to which we contribute, and on which we draw. With enduring commitment through times of great change, successive generations have demonstrated that whilst the goodwill for which the Commonwealth is renowned may be intangible, its impact is very real.  It was Meghan and Prince Harrys second Commonwealth event of the day, having spent the morning at Canadas High Commission in London .Meghan wore a custom green wool embellished coat and matching dress by Canadian and Turkish fashion designer Erdem for the earlier event. The couple watched youngsters, whose parents work at the commission, making and eating Canadas quintessential sugary treat - maple taffy.  After watching the youngsters and listening as Harry asked how many of these are you allowed , the Duchess tried making one for herself. She then gave it to nine-year-old Elodie-Rose Dugua-Inegbese. The schoolgirl said about being given Meghans taffy: I was so excited. She said does anyone want one  And she said to me would you like it  Thenhanded it to me. It was really fun meeting Meghan and shes really pretty and was really friendly.

The ,-mile wide weather bomb has triggered severe weather warnings from the Met Office with gales up to mph and heavy rain expected for more than  hours once the storm makes landfall.A yellow warning for strong winds covers Northern Ireland, Wales, most of England and western parts of Scotland, while a rain warning has been issued for the North West of England, where more than two inches could fall. Storm Gareth brings a risk of damage to buildings, flying debris, large waves and flooding in addition to power cuts and travel chaos, forecasters said. Showers could be wintry over hills while northern and central parts could be hit by thunderstorms and hail as the country is battered by the massive and powerful storm.   The intense storm, caused by a deep area of low pressure, has been given a name to bring greater urgency and awareness to the Met Offices warnings. Forecasters have urged people to take precautions so they arent caught out by severe weather. The Met Office has issued three separate weather warnings for wind or rain before the worst of Storm Gareth hits. The first covers the North West of England, where more than two inchesof rain could fall over higher ground in Cumbria by pm on Tuesday, increasing the risk of flooding on already wet ground.  About .insis expected quite widely. The second warning, for wind, covers Northern Ireland from pm Tuesday to pm Wednesday. The Met Office said: A spell of strong northwesterly winds are expected across Northern Ireland for the evening travel period, continuing overnight and Wednesday morning. Gusts of up to mph are likely inland with a small chance of reaching mph for a time in squally showers.  Gusts of -mph are likely along northern coasts, perhaps up to mph for a time. Winds will steadily ease through Wednesday morning. Those strong winds will later extend into Wales, England and Scotland, where a yellow warning will be in place from pm on Tuesday until pm on Wednesday. The Met Office warned: A spell of strong northwesterly winds is expected to develop across southwest Scotland late on Tuesday evening then extend across much of England and Wales through Wednesday.  Gusts of up to -mph are likely inland and mph along western coasts. Winds will gradually ease during Wednesday afternoon. Almost two dozen flood alerts have been issued across northern England. In Wales, four have been issued around Snowdonia National Park and two in Brecon Beacons National Park. Scotland has issued six flood warnings and two flood alerts.  On Tuesday morning, winds were already gusting to mph at Mumbles Head in South Wales, and mph at both St Marys on the Isles of Scilly and the South Ulst Range in northwest Scotland. By .am almost two inchesof rain had fallen at Capel Curig in North Wales over the previous  hours, while Shap in Cumbria had recorded a similar amount . A yellow weather warning for rain is also in place in parts of northern England on Thursday and Friday. Drivers have been told to expect longer journey times, while air, rail and bus passengers could face delays or cancellations.  Temperatures will hit about C in some places, but it wont feel pleasant due to the wind and or rain. Gareth is slamming in the UK just days after severe winds, snow and rain caused disruption on Sunday. Why Storm Gareth  The Met Office and Met Eireann, the Irish weather service, produce a list of storm names just before the beginning of autumn every year. Its believed that people pay closer attention to severe weather warningsit is a named storm. Gareth was named by Met Eireann and is the third named storm this year after Erik in February and Freya earlier this month. Gareth has been dubbed a ,-mile wide weather bomb, or explosive cyclogenesis, when air pressure drops rapidly in a single day.  The rotation of a storm is increased, creating destructive weather conditions. Storms Ali and Bronagh hit in September last year, Callum in October and Deirdre in December. The next named storms will be Hannah, Idris and Jane. Met Office five-day weather forecastTuesdayHeavy rain across Wales and northern England, spreading southeastwards, with gusty winds. Brighter skies following from the north and later west, with heavy, blustery showers, wintry over northern hills. Turning very windy later, with severe gales in the northwest. Tuesday nightVery windy with severe gales in the north. Heavy and squally showers across northern and central parts with risk of hail of thunder. Drier in the south with clear spells.WednesdayCold and very windy with sunshine and showers, heavy in places with snow over northern hills. Showers will steadily ease but rain will reach the west later.Thursday to SaturdayUnsettled throughout with bouts of wind and rain, heaviest in the west. Some drier and brighter interludes are likely. Rather cold in the north, milder at times in the south. Snow on the way The Met Offices extended forecast is predicting further spells of rain and snow as spring nears. The forecast, for Saturday  March to Monday  March, says: Cloud and rain are expected to affect the south, and perhaps central parts, of the UK early on Saturday, and will clear with bright and showery weather extending countrywide by the days end. Showers may be heavy in the north and fall as a mixture of sleet or snow, especially on high ground.Any strong winds will ease through the day too. Lighter winds and cooler on Sunday. Then there are signals for an Atlantic-driven and unsettled theme through the following week. We are likely to see further spells of wind and rain, followed by drier, more showery periods. The wettest, windiest weather always most likely in the northwest. Towards the end of the outlook there may be a tendency for more settled conditions to affect southern areas. The first day of spring is Wednesday  March.

Millions of people from around the world watched the heartbreaking footage as Snoop was abandoned on the streets of Stoke-on-Trent shortly before Christmas. The pooch was seen chasing his former owners car as they pulled off into the distance leaving him with just his bed. Celebrities including namesake rapper Snoop Dogg offered to rehome the Staffie but the RSPCA said the pooch was suffering from separation anxiety after being left in the street. The RSPCA has now revealed Snoop has found a loving new home in rural Herefordshire with Laurence Squire, StokeonTrentLive reports. Laurence said: He is a fantastic dog and he settled in straightaway. As soon as he came into the house for the first time, he jumped on the sofa and it was as though he decided that was the space for him. He loves to lie on the back of the sofa andI put the fire on he will curl up in front of it.He loves being warm andhe can find his way into a bedroom, you’ll find him under the duvet with his head on the pillow.  With Laurence working from home, Snoop is now free to roam around a large garden area and the surrounding fields. He has also become a regular in the village pub. RSPCA spokeswoman Rachel Butler has revealed Snoop is loving his new le having battled with separation anxiety after being abandoned. She said: When I visited Snoop in his new home, I could tell straight away that he was in the right place - he and Laurence already have a strong bond and Snoop absolutely dotes on him.  She continued: In the days after his abandonment, Snoop was incredibly nervous and anxious, which is no surprise after what happened to him. But staff at Gonsal Farm worked really hard in building up his confidence and it really paid off. The change in Snoop is massive and we at the RSPCA are so incredibly proud of him. His story put into the spotlight the very sad reality of abandonments, something which the RSPCA deals with every day. He was dumped at Christmas, a time of year which we spend with our loved ones, so for something so unloving to happen to him was heartbreaking. But the love and attention he is getting now from Laurence is wonderful. Snoop is living like a king.   The video, released on Christmas Eve, shows the Staffordshire Bull Terrier led out of a car at the side of the road. The footage then shows the man then running back to the car, which drives away, while the canine repeatedly jumps up at the vehicles window in distress. After the incident Snoop was taken to the RSPCA in Shropshire to be looked after. The investigation into Snoop’s abandonment is ongoing.

The mum-to-be then admitted that she pinned up a photo of the lunch thief stealing her food.   Sheturned back to look at the screen in horror. The execs at my office who knew my lunches were getting stolen were visibly pissed at her. As it turns out, one of the execs who’d come from headquarters was also pregnant, and the other one had a we who’d just had a baby. She was terminated. It sounds cutthroat, but the woman reveals she never wanted it to go this far.  I didnt want her to get fired, I just wanted her to stop. If theyd ever talked to me, I wouldnt have wanted to get her fired. Aside from seeing the picture in the interview, they never involved me further. Never even asked me to send them the picture evidence for their own record.

Little Isaiah Neil died from heatstroke after he was left strapped inside the vehicle outside his grandparents home, prosecutors claim. The eight-month-old was said to be limp, sweaty and hot when he was discovered by his father, Shane Neil, in November . Neil would later tell a police officer: We cooked the baby. Worried about his son, the dad said he rushed him inside and woke up his partner Lacey Te Whetu - Isaiahs mum - who had fallen asleep. Giving evidence in court, Neil said Te Whetu checked on Isaiah and found him to be fine and breathing, so the youngster was put to bed.But at around pm, he said he woke up and checked on the baby again at the property in Ruatoki, New Zealand, according to local media.   The child was saturated with sweat - and despite efforts to cool him down and revive him, he sadly died, the New Zealand Herald reports. While the Crown says he died from heatstroke, the defence has rejected this, saying there is considerable doubt it caused his death. Neil and Te Whetu have both pleaded guilty to manslaughter after their little boy died at the scene near Whakatāne, jurors have heard. They are now witnesses in the trial of Te Whetus mum Donna Catherine Parangi - who is charged with grandson Isaiahs manslaughter. Parangi has pleaded not guilty to the charge. The court has heard that the trio all lived together and were smoking synthetic cannabis on the day Isaiah died, according to the Herald. They all fell asleep, leaving the baby in the vehicle, prosecutors say. Under questioning from Richard Marchant, prosecuting, Neil said that he had found his son inside the car, with all the windows closed. [He was] sweaty, wet, hot, said the father. He added that he took the youngster inside and checked him for a pulse, but said: I couldnt tell, I was still pretty high.   The court heard Neil then woke up Te Whetu, who said Isaiah was still breathing, so the parents both went back to bed. But Neil said he later discovered the unresponsive infant in his cot. In a panic, he and Te Whetu sprinkled cold water on their son and gave him CPR, before paramedics tried to resuscitate the youngster. Te Whetu was said to be screaming and out of control. Tragically, Isaiah couldnt be saved. Neil told the court that he was gone. The court heard a pathologist found extensive bruising and an adult bite mark on the babys body following his death. Giving evidence, Neil denied inflicting the injuries. Parangis defence lawyer, Susan Gray, hit out at some of the fathers evidence, saying it was a figment of his imagination. Gray has said science is not on the side of the Crown in this case and that asphysxia could be another possible cause of Isaiahs death. Following Neils evidence, Te Whetu appeared as a witness and told jurors that her mum, who was working full-time, helped her to look after Isaiah because she wasnt capable herself. The court heard Te Whetu had a drug addiction, Newstalk ZB reports. The mother told jurors that her son felt hot when he was recovered from the car, but she thought he had been in a deep sleep. The trial at the High Courtat Hamilton continues.

Catherine Shaws body was discovered on Monday, a week after she was last seen leaving a hostel carrying a stray puppy. It is believed the -year-old, from Witney, Oxfordshire, had hiked from Eco Hotel Mayachik to the Nariz del Indio summit, overlooking Lake Atitlan, to watch the sunrise on March . After the search came to a tragic end, a preliminary police report claimed the Brit was found naked and had visible blows to her body and lacerations on her left leg. Her father had reportedly flown to the Central American country to join the search.   Miss Shaws jacket and trousers were found on the mountain shortly before her body was discovered near the village of San Juan La Laguna. Her body was found about ft from where the puppy was found on Friday, said Amy Farrow, an American woman involved in the search for Miss Shaw. Community leader Juan Mendoza said the trousers had been found at the Nariz del Indio summit. Mr Mendoza described the -year-old’s death as a crime and called on authorities to find those responsible. Police sources told local press they believed she had been murdered, although officially Guatemala’s PNC force said only it had launched a “criminal investigation” into the “deplorable incident.”  Miss Shaw was found naked near a popular mountain beauty spot called Nariz del Indio - Indian Nose in English - which is a two-hour hike from the hotel she was staying at and is regularly visited by backpackers who travel to the spot nearly ,ft above sea level to watch the sun come up. The peak of the mountain, where a lookout shack with wooden benches has been built which visitors can climb on top of to enjoy a panoramic view of Lake Atitlan, is the tip of the Indian nose and was considered a sacred site by the Mayans who would pray and conduct religious services. Mr Mendoza, revealing volunteers had found Miss Shaw’s body and another search team had found a pair of trousers believed to be the backpacker’s, said: “It’s terrible this type of thing happens in our area and we urge the authorities to investigate because these crimes stain the good name of our municipality.”  A preliminary police report, leaked to local press, said Miss Shaw was found “totally naked, face down and at first sight has visible blows to her body and lacerations on her left leg. A spokesman for Guatemala’s PNC police confirmed she had “several blows” but said the state of decomposition of her body meant it was not possible to confirm how the injuries had been caused at the scene of the find, and forensic experts would have to determine the cause of death. Guatemala’s Interior Ministry said in a statement after Miss Shaw’s body was found: “After several days of intense searching by police authorities, other institutions and volunteers for the missing British national, participating teams are being coordinated at the scene where her body has been found. “After  hours of an exhaustive search, the result is very regrettable and the Interior Ministry and police chiefs have immediately designated a team which will carry out the criminal investigation.  “This is to determine what has happened and who could be involved in this deplorable incident. Ms Farrow, who lives in the town where Miss Shaw was staying, said the body has been recovered by local authorities. She wrote on Facebook: “We are deeply saddened that it turned into a body recovery mission instead of a rescue.“When we set out to help find her we were hopeful to locate her alive.” She said teams of volunteers, local authorities, a helicopter, drones and search dogs were involved in the effort.  Ms Farrow wrote: “As horrible as it was, we were also relieved to at least know where she was. She was about  feet down from where reports of the puppy was found . She added: “Once the autopsy is conducted, we can determineit was a fall or foul play.“Given how concerned the locals and towns are it was very apparent this incident is pretty rare in beautul #lagoatitlan.” Miss Shaw disappeared in the early hours of March  after leaving Eco Hotel Mayachik clutching a puppy and leaving her mobile phone and passport behind in her room. The stray dog - shivering but alive - was found at the highest lookout of Indian Nose, near to the spot where her body was found, between am and am on Friday morning.  Ms Farrow wrote: We knew from friends that a nature lover spirit like Catherine would not have left the small dog alone. Miss Shaws distinctive woollen pink and cream jacket was found at the base of the hike and handed to police, and her trousers were later found at the summit. Her had been travelling in Guatemala for two weeks, having previously been in Mexico and Calornia, before she disappeared. She was travelling with a friend, who woke up on the morning of March  to find that she was missing. Before Miss Shaws body was found, her parents, Ann and Tarquin Shaw, had said they were desperately worried and her disappearance was unusually.  They said in a statement: She has always been really good about keeping in touch and informing us of her whereabouts and activities. So this is unusual behaviour which gives us great concern for her safety. Please help us to find her. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which is supporting Ms Shaws family, said on Monday evening that a body had been found which is believed to be Ms Shaws. In a statement it added: The Lucie Blackman Trust is saddened to announce that a body has been found in the search for Catherine Shaw. Formal identication has not taken place but the body is believed to be Catherine. Catherines family have been informed. Please respect their privacy at this dficult time. The charity said Ms Shaw had left the hotel in Mayachik, near San Pedro and San Juan, on March  at .am, but then ed at .am.  She then left again for the last time at .am, heading in the direction of the lake. The trust said that at this point she had a puppy with her but no other possessions. A hand drum, known as a hang, previously reported to be in Ms Shaws possession, was left behind and has been located, and she did not have a guitar with her when she left, the trust added. The search encountered many challenges including communication issues due to lack of power in the area. Friends had set up a Facebook page to help to coordinate the search efforts and raise funds to pay for a helicopter to join the hunt for her. A post on Monday evening read: Our diligent searchers have found Catherine Shaw’s body at the top of El Naudiz in San Juan La Laguna. The municipality, police, rescuers and volunteers have been searching the area since :am this morning. We appreciate everyone’s effort and help in bringing resolution to the situation. This is all the information we have at this time.

Everyone on board the new plane -  passengers and eight crew members - was killed when it went down just six minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa on Sunday morning. The cause of the crash isnt known, but in the aftermath of the tragedy Boeing model has been grounded by a number of countries and airlines until they are confident it is airworthy. Aviation experts have raised concerns and passengers are refusing to board the aircraft - but how do you knowyour upcoming flight uses a Boeing  Max     It is rather easy to find out through the airline itself or an aviation website or app. Check with your airline When you do an online search for flights it will usually tell you the flight number and possibly the type of plane that is scheduled to be used. If the search or booking process doesnt list the aircraft model, get in touch with the airline by phone or the internet to ask what plane is used one that route, or check an aviation tracking website or app.  If you have already booked a trip and you dont know what kind of aircraft is being used, you can find out by accessing your booking on the airlines website using your booking reference. It should list of the plane you will fly on. Check a plane tracking website Websites and apps that track planes will likely list the information you are looking for, but sometimes only in cases where flights are a few days or weeks away. Flightradar and FlightAware are two of the more popular sites which track planes in real-time and also have details about past and future journeys. You will need the flight number to find out which plane or planes are typically used on a certain route. For example, FlightAwares activity log for flight ET, the identier used by the plane that crashed, states that a Boeing - Dreamliner was used on the Addis Ababa-Nairobi route on Saturday, and a Boeing  Max  on Sunday. Check the planes registration  If you know the planes registration number you can look up details, including the type of plane and how old it is, on a public database run by a civil aviation body. You can find the registration number on the side of the plane or by looking up a specic flight on a tracking website or app. In the UK, passengers can check the Civil Aviation Authoritys website. Which airlines have stopped using the jet  Airlines such as Tui are continuing to operate flights out of the UK using Boeings  Max  plane despite suspensions around the world. Two Max  planes have crashed in five months - the Ethiopian Airlines aircraft and a Lion Air jet that went down in the Java Sea off Indonesia in October, killing everyone on board. Australia, Singapore and China have temporarily grounded the aircraft.  A number of airlines have grounded their fleet, including Royal Air Maroc, Cayman Airways, South Koreas Eastar Jet, Singapores SilkAir, Mongolian Airlines, Aeromexico, Aeroliacuteneas Argentinas and Comair, a British Airways franchise in southern Africa. Tui Airways has the only five  Max  aircraft operated by a UK-based airline, and is due to begin flying a sixth later this week. A spokesman for Tui said: We have no indication that we cant operate our  Max in a safe way like we do with all other planes in our network. Scandinavian airline Norwegian has  Boeing  Max  aircraft and continues to use the model. The airline said it is monitoring the Ethiopia case and will follow any recommendations from Boeing and civil aviation authorities. Ryanair, which is pressing ahead with an order for  of the jets, said it is also monitoring the situation. American Airlines, Southwest, Icelandair, Flydubai, WestJet, Air Canada and GOL Linhas Aereas also continue to use the plane. A quick search of Twitter shows passengers have expressed fears about boarding a Boeing  Max , with many tweets sent directly to airlines, asking themtheir upcoming flight uses one. What is Boeing saying  The US Federal Aviation Administration, which esponsible for certying all Boeing  Max  models, has told airlines it believes the aircraft to be airworthy. Chicago-based Boeing said it was working closely with the FAA on development, planning and certication of a software enhancement. The update is due to be rolled out in the coming weeks. Boeing has sent a team to the crash site in Ethiopia. Earlier, it said the investigation is in its early stages and there is no need to issue new guidance to operators of its  Max  aircraft.

its application for a pound, grant to prepare a business plan and carry out surveys has been turned down by the Scottish Land Fund.Following feedback, however, it is now preparing to submit another application in May and is hoping for more positive news.It is also planning to open the usually locked park gates to the public for one week at Easter and another week in the school summer holidays.It is a repeat of a successful two-week trial opening last summer when hundreds took up the chance to enjoy the space for ious uses including family outings, outdoor office meetings and picnic lunches.Leading campaigner Jon Ford hopes to encourage greater use and activities during the opening weeks taking place April ndash and July ndash.ldquoThis year, we also want people to let us knowthey want to form a programme of events and we can seeit is something we can put on, he said.ldquoIf people are out and about in the park there might be a shinty game going on, for example, or a pipe band.Another possibility might be a Teddy bearsrsquo picnic.The group is also in talks with the Care and Learning Allianceabout future possibilities to use the location for childcare provision .In addition, discussions have taken place with the Calman Trust a young peoplersquos service offering housing support, training, employment opportunities, cooking services, about serving refreshments.Jaci Douglas, Calarsquos chief executive, said during discussions with the community over a year ago, flexible and accessible childcare was identied as one of the needs in the area along with a possible use for the park space.ldquoWe have been working closely with the Northern Meeting Park Group on how best to meet that aspiration, she said.ldquoAs an early years charity, Cala is well

There are still concerns regarding the future of the fishermanrsquos hut, erosion of the river bank and where the displaced water will go in high water conditions.Cllr Bill Boyd said some people were not behind My Ness, which was to replace the highly controversial tilting pier artwork earmarked for the riverbank at Eden Court until it was ditched two years ago after a public furore.

reds best chance gone","story":"Dons boss Derek McInnes has dismissed the doubters who believe they have missed their best chance of progressing in the Scottish Cup.Tonight Aberdeen play Rangers at Ibrox in their quarter-final replay for the right to face Celtic in the last four of the tournament.The replay occurs after a - draw at Pittodrie last Sunday week.The Reds dominated that encounter but were unable to claim victory. As a result plenty of pundits are making the Gers favourites to progress on their own patch this evening.However, McInnes insists nothing has changed as Aberdeen look to move a step closer to winning the Scottish Cup for the first time since .The Dons gaffer said: “The Scottish Cup is important and over the history of the club we haven’t won it as many times as we would have liked.“As a club we have not won it for a long time. In my time here we have been close.“We have reached semi-finals and a final but for us to achieve what we set out to do we will have to beat a strong Rangers in Glasgow.“The intention is to win the cup and nothing has changed just because we got a really dficult draw against Rangers.“People think we have missed our chance by being the better team at Pittodrie and not winning.“Just because the game is in Glasgow nothing has changed for us.“It will be two good teams going head to head and our intention is to put Rangers out and get through.“I want to win the Scottish Cup – but I don’t get too dispirited when we don’t.“The intention is to keep on going. We want it to be this year, butit isn’t we will try to win it next year.“Myself and my players know what we want and we have to set about the task of going in and doing it and hopefully we can.”Aberdeen head for Govan this evening following Saturday’s - draw with Celtic at Parkhead. It was a resolute defensive display from the Dons against the Premiership champions.McInnes is hoping his charges can deliver another showing of that ilk and keep another clean sheet against Rangers.The importance of shutting out Steven Gerrard’s side doesn’t need to be emphasised.Both victories for the Reds against the Gers this season have come when they have kept clean sheets – - at Ibrox in the league in December and by the same score in October’s League Cup semi-final.McInnes added: “When you play against good teams who like to dominate the ball like Celtic and Rangers you have to be smart with your work. You can’t give them too much space to operate because good players like space.“Both Celtic and Rangers have got good players with a lot of pace who can punish you.“If we had even resources we could go and take Celtic on and play in a certain way. But we have to find other ways to get our results and win a cup competition.“This game will be similar where we need to pick and choose our fights, be good defensively as a team but also have the courage and confidence to go and play and create chances.“We have scored against Rangers in every game we’ve played them this season, but like Celtic they’re not easy to score against.“The defensive part of the game on Saturday was good and not many teams go to Parkhead and keep a clean sheet.“The last three times we’ve gone there we’ve won -, lost - and drew -.“There’s been nothing in those games and it shows with the right concentration and enough determination you can get the desired results.”McInnes is hopeful of having wingers Gary Mackay-Steven and Niall McGinn available tonight.Both missed Saturday’s draw with Celtic, Mackay-Steven with a calf knock and McGinn with a hip problem."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/SOCCER-Leeds-201615.jpg ","title":"no brom ance as mcinnes keeps all his attention on quarter final","story":"Derek McInnes is fully focused on his work with Aberdeen and not looking at speculation linking him with ato West Brom.Albion boss Darren Moore, a friend and former team-mate of McInnes, was sacked on Saturday night.That is despite the Hawthorns club sitting fourth in the Championship with the possibility of promotion either automatically or through the play-offs back to the Premier League.As is customary when jobs such as West Brom become available, speculation circulates, particularly on social media, about McInnes potentially moving on from Pittodrie.However, the Dons boss, who played with Moore for Albion from -, takes no notice of the rumours and is devoting his attention to the Reds’ Scottish Cup quarter-final replay against Rangers tonight.Slavisa Jokanovic and David Wagner are among the favourites to take over at West Brom, with Scot Alex Neil also mentioned.McInnes said: “I’m gutted for Darren Moore because it’s such a harsh decision.“I spoke to him last week and it just seems so unfair on him to lose his job.“We are used to it now as managers, we are used to seeing managers lose their job unfairly.“In terms of myself and everyone  at Aberdeen, we have work to concentrate on and that’s what we’re doing.“It’s very rare that managers get much understanding or time in the modern day, but it still seems really unfair.”This evening McInnes will have to do without striker Sam Cosgrove, who is suspended.The Englishman has scored  goals this season, but is out after picking up yellow cards against Queen of the South in round five and in the initial - quarter-final draw with Rangers.Stevie May or James Wilson are set to be drafted in to replace Cosgrove. Both May and Wilson have only found the net three times this season.Although McInnes is disappointed to be without Cosgrove he sees the clash with the Gers as an opportunity for someone .He added: “Sam has been a permanent fixture for us over the last few months and has been very good.“He’s someone that we’ve turned to in a lot of big games.“He helps occupy defenders, he gives us size and strength and he gives us goals as well.“We have a squad for a reason – we’ve never been totally dependent on a particular player – our biggest strength has always been the team.“It’s up to us and others to take responsibility now to find a way to win.“We’ve been in a lot of games this season without key players.“In some cases it has maybe affected us, but in other cases it has been an opportunity for others and they have taken those opportunities so that’s what we’re hoping for in this game.”The Aberdeen defence will come up against Alfredo Morelos again at Ibrox.The Colombian striker has shown both sides of his game against the Dons.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob sheilds make new recycling","story":"NewsBob Shields: Make new recycling system in South Ayrshire work for usNew leaflets needed to inform the publicShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter a first glance at last week’s report on noisy bin men – I had to check out my calendar to make sure I wasn’t getting a month ahead of myself. Let’s face it, stories about a Mr Paine and some broken glass usually appear on April . But no – it really was only March ! Mr Paine’s issue is the emptying of his street’s bottle bins at am. On the morning of his first collection, he mistook the noise of breaking glass for a robber breaking into his house. “I was terried,” he said. And then added, “This is noise pollution and most of the street must have been up.” Well, I too have suffered Mr Paine’s ‘noise pollution’ - perhaps an even noisier version. Chez Shields is no stranger to a well chilled Petit Chablis washing down the foie gras before Eastenders. In fact, I’ve been known to pop a second cork just to recover from Eastenders! Based on Mr Paine’s video recording, the noise made by the emptying of my bottle bin is right up there - somewhere between a small public house and a decent sized restaurant. Andit wakes up my neighbours – I couldn’t give a Chateau Le Clos! On my street’s first collection, I didn’t wake up thinking I was being burgled. House-breakers don’t usually make enough noise to get “most of the street up”. I seem to remember thinking, “That’ll be the bin men . . .” and going back to sleep. And on the  days a year that the glass bins are emptied in “quiet, residential Masonhill”, I respectfully suggest Mr Paine does the same. After all, we’re talking about saving the world here . . . not saving an hour’s kip! Greenhouse gas emissions are asphyxiating the planet. Plastic bags are strangling dolphins and milk bottle caps are choking sea birds. Our little Earth is throttling itself. To be honest, I’d rather be concentrating on ten decades of industrial pollution than Mr Paine’s ten minutes of noise pollution. And meanwhile, still in bin land, South Ayrshire Council is blaming the public for the latest waste collection problems. I can see the point they’re making – but the word “contamination” is a bit strong for Mrs McGuffie putting Tiddle’s empty Whiskas can in the paper and cardboard bin. And the new recycling system is a little too new for the “red tag” bin police to be targeting offenders. By refusing to lt certain bins – South Ayrshire Council is tempting fate. I’ve heard reports of some people using a neighbour’s bin when their own bin is full and red tagged. I’m also told there are increasing incidences of household waste being stuffed in the street bins reserved for pedestrian litter. And stuck in the middle are the bin men themselves. One told me “If we red tag a bin – we get **** from the householder. If we take back a contaminated bin, we get **** from our supervisors. Basically, were in the **** no matter what we do!” My dear old mum used to use a lovely phrase – “There’s a place for everything . . . .and everything in its place”. That’s exactly how SAC’s new recycling system meant to work. But it’s going to take a little time and a little patience – on both sides. The info leaflets sent out to explain the new system were largely ignored or discarded - most people didn’t understand them. But with the new bins now rolled out – a back-up leaflet might help. “You’ve got your new bins – now here’s how to use them”. Rubbishing the new rubbish system isn’t going to make it go away. It’s here – let’s get on with making it work for ourselves, our neighbours and our community.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironment"},{"url":null,"title":"churches facing end era parish","story":"NewsChurches facing end of era as parish minister calls it a dayCrisis in Kirk conregationsShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email There’s no parish ministers round here, writes Edwin LawrenceThat’s the crisis facing Kirk congregations in Girvan and South Carrick. And it becomes reality with the imminent departure of Rev Richard Moffat from Girvan North Parish Church. The area – in the short term at least – will be dependent on the services of elderly retired ministers and lay readers. Mr Moffat has been a popular parish minister at Girvan North for five years. And he was due to become Moderator of the Presbytery of Ayr in April. But he is set to move to a new charge in Morayshire, to be closer to his daughter and her family. He will conduct his last Sunday service in Girvan North on March . Mr Moffat’s departure is the latest factor concentrating minds in the Church of Scotland. For Girvan South, linked with Barr and Dailly is currently without its minister. Popular Rev Ian McLachlan has been on sick leave for several months. And colleagues say he is unlikely toto full-time duties. Rev Stephen Ogston was parish minister at Ballantrae Colmonell from  until August, . But he moved on to Luce Valley Church, and no replacement has been found. The linked charge of Ballantrae St Colmon also takes in services at Barrhill and Glenapp. So communities right across Girvan and South Carrick no longer have a parish minister in their midst. And there is uncertaintly at how things will be resolved. One solution might be a union of the two Girvan churches. And that could leave Girvan North - with its -foot spire – as the last kirk in town. It would presumably also be used as a hub to minister to village churches. The Post understands there can be as few as six worshippers in Barr Parish Church on Sundays. This isn’t helped by Barr being last in the pecking order for services, after Girvan South and Dailly. So it’s virtually lunchtime before a Sunday service gets under way. A Presbytery of Ayr meeting was due in the Carrick Centre in Maybole on Tuesday this week.And the Post understands this will see Rev Ian Stirling Fisherton Kirkoswald appointed interim moderator at Girvan North. Locum minister will be retired minister Rev Edgar Ogston – father of Stephen – who livesin Girvan.The Post has spoken to kirk elders in Girvan who say they’re uncertain about the future. And a retired church minister suspects that the two Girvan churches will be required to amalgamate. He said: “Things are changing. We’ve been a clergy-centred church for  years. “But one positive thing we’re seeing is the rise of worship groups which are prompting people to think about their faith, without necessarily being preached at.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandAyrMoffatGirvan"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems. Ayrshire College supremos and invited senior staff will stage a sit-down feast later this month to mark five years since its formation. The dinner for  will also include free wine after a sponsored deal by college chairman Willie Mackie. Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"first minister must act over","story":"NewsFirst Minister must act over Tarbolton landfill, says MSPThe South of Scotland Tory MSP says he is hearing growing concerns from villagers about the condition of the site.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsBrian Whittle MSP challenges the First Minister in the Scottish Parliament \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than eight months after Tarbolton Landfill’s owners entered liquidation, MSP Brian Whittle has challenged the First Minister to act, writes Edwin Lawrence.

In response, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:   “I am not able to give that information to Brian Whittle right now. “I undertake to raise the issue with the environment secretary and to come back to Brian Whittle as quickly as possible about our understanding of the lines of accountability and the action that the Scottish Government can take to try to reach a resolution of what certainly seems to be a deeply unsatisfactory situation. “I can understand that people in the local area will be very concerned about any prospect of contamination and it is absolutely necessary that all relevant agencies and organisations respond as quickly as possible.” Speaking afterwards, Brian Whittle MSP said: “The situation with the Tarbolton Landfill has been allowed to drag on for too long already. “Aside from the obvious concerns local residents have, it’s troubling that there doesn’t appear to be a clearly defined process for when the operator of a site like this is no longer able to carry out their duties to protect the surrounding environment. “I hope the First Minister will be able to provide some much needed clarity on this issue.” "},{"url":null,"title":"giant bins placed right outside","story":"NewsGiant bins placed right outside a restaurant and pub in scenic townAnger in Troon as bin squad set up town corral without asking anyone for permissionShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA council works gang put up a new big bin enclosure – right outside a restaurant and pub in the scenic centre of town. Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls. The early indications are that this system is working well, however we are currently reviewing the location of the bins.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartyTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month.

It’s being billed as a brand new Laugh Out Loud Magic Show. Sooty takes to the air in a flying car, Soo has a singing unicorn and Sweep has something altogether dferent. He has a levitating sausage, which certainly creates a vision. Special guests circus star Michael Jordan and the ultraviolet specialties of Fantasie de la Nuit promise a thrilling -minute show. Tickets are between pound and pound and there are two shows – am and .pm. Sooty has celebrated his th birthday and Richard says he’s still as young as ever. Richard revealed: “This show is Sooty doing what he does best – magic. “So the Gaiety audience can expect to be saying ‘Izzy whizzy let’s get busy’ a great deal. “Sooty will be performing some amazing tricks including sawing a lady in half, floating a child from the audience and making it snow. “Sweep will be getting in the way with his own disastrous magic tricks most of which revolve around sausages.” He added: “Performing live is what we love most. Of course, making the television show is a lot of fun but Sooty has always been at his best in front of a live audience where he can make not only the children laugh, but all the adults too. Plus after each performance there is a chance for everybody to meet Sooty and it’s always such a pleasure to meet fans old and new.” Sooty and Sweep performed for Prince Charles for his th birthday. Richard added: “I think it was possibly the highlight of Sooty’s career. It was just an amazing experience to be there at the London Palladium at the request of Prince Charles. “It turns out that Sooty and Sweep have always been personal favourites of the Prince. We also received a lovely personal letter saying how much he had enjoyed Sooty and Sweep’s performance. You have to remember that the royals were also children once and Sooty brought magic to their childhood too.” Book for the show at the Gaiety Box Office  .Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsTheatre"},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-shows-sweet-charity-love","story":"SWEET Charity may be about a down-on-her-luck dancehall hostess searching for love.But there was certainly a lot of it coming from the Volunteer Hall audience at the end of Galashiels Operatic Amateur Societyrsquos opening show on Monday night.Led this year by Carla McColgan, the group put on another faultless performance.

close to where he first made his famous Coulters Candy - around August.And he will be joined by two additional bronzes - of a boy and girl - later in the year.The three-piece commemoration is being designed and made by Innerleithen sculptor Angela Hunter.Originally from Galashiels, Angela has worked alongside local historians Mary Craig and Graeme McIver, as well as local councillor Sandy Aitchison to champion Coltartrsquos story.Angela told us: ldquoI am delighted we now have an agreed design we are able to let the Borders public see.ldquoThe agreed design of the Robert Coltart sculpture is based on newspaper cuttings, including an image we have of him.\"While we can never be  percent certain of his appearance, the research by Mary and Graeme and feedback to our appeal means I feel I can now portray his stature and personality.ldquoI will now press ahead with producing a lasting legacy for Robert Coltart that Galashiels can be proud of.Robert Coltart was born in Dumfries and Galloway and moved to Galashiels at a young age, like many at the time, to work in the mills.It was during the s that it is thought the weaver began making aniseed-flavoured toffee at his Overhaugh Street home.As well as doing a fine trade at fairs, he would sell his candy around the streets of his adopted hometown by playing a whistle and singing his jingle - Ally Bally Bee - with a trail of children in his wake.Coltart also lived at houses in Henderson Close and Park Street, which have both since been demolished.And he was known to travel to nearby Melrose and Selkirk, as well as other Borders towns, to sell his candy on the streets.An appeal in January for further information on Robert Coltart saw Angela receive messages from across Scotland and even Canada, which helped with the final design.Historian Mary added: ldquoRobert Coltartrsquos story is one that many more people should know about and I hope this sculpture will encourage people to find out how the famous song Coulterrsquos Candy came to be written by a weaver from Galashiels.The finished tribute in the Market Square will become part of a new town trail, supported by the Scottish Government.Around pound, of improvements are planned as part of the regeneration of the town centre.Helen Calder of Energise Galashiels Trust, who has also championed Coltartrsquos story, said: ldquoWe want Galashiels to be a more vibrant, welcoming and confident community.\"The tale of Robert Coltart embodies this vision, and we are delighted progress is now being made to finally celebrate his link to our town.The funding from the Scottish Government is also supporting new visitor signage and improvements to Channel Street and Douglas Bridge, as well as helping to fund the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction.The town trail will include the location of Robert Coltartrsquos one bedroom flat in Overhaugh Street, which he shared with his family.Councillor Mark Rowley, who is the spokesman for business, said: ldquoIn line with other regeneration works going on in Galashiels, the Coulterrsquos Candy project has been taken forward with a number of partners and it was important they all had sight of the initial design before it was issued publicly.ldquoA real effort is being made to ensure visitors are attracted to Galashiels, and the wider Borders area, and it is worth noting that without the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction -

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"letter 1949 play about europe","story":"Courier readers may be as amused as I was to discover at the commemorative exhibition in Aqualibrium that the winner of the first Kintyre Drama Festival, back in , was Highland Church Drama Club.The club won with a play entitled #Sad about Europe#.

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents. He shot to fame in the s with a solo ascent of a climb on the Dru, renamed the Bonatti Pillar, in the French alps.Bonatti finished his hard climbing career in  with a solo in winter of the north face of the Matterhorn for the centenary of that mountain#s first attempt. He passed away, aged , in bed.Up till Free Solo, many films about climbing have only been of real interest to climbers and have not made it into mainstream cinema.Using the latest techniques including drones, remote cameras, huge telephoto lenses on digital cameras from the valley floor and cameras wielded by dangling climbers has created a National Geographic movie which has transfixed audiences.Even climbers emerge after an-hour-and-a-half with sweaty palms after the glimpse into Honnold#s seemingly nihilistic world.A still of Alex Honnold during his climb.

Less generous pension schemes have to stretch further as people are living for longer post-retirement.ldquoAuto-enrolment is welcome, but will not solve the basic problem of low levels of pension

hearing from people who are considering accessing their pension funds to solve debt problems, at the expense of their retirement income, which of course brings the risk of long-term financial

We need to fund our NHS, our schools, our local authorities, build infrastructure and homes. We need to build the Scotland we want and we should not give that vision up.The Commissionrsquos six tests would assess whether Scotlandrsquos economic record was credible and sustainable whether markets had faith in a new Scottish Central Bank and its ability to issue debt whether the public and business wanted it whether Scotland had adequate reserves whether it would improve trade and whether Scotlandrsquos economic cycle was ldquosignicantly out of phase with that of the rest of the UK to make it ldquofeasible and desirable.Andrew Wilson, the former SNP MSP who authored the Commission, said explaining these tests to voters before a second referendum was an ldquoabsolute necessity.But Mr Kerevan said: ldquoThe views of international markets and corporations should always fall behind that of the people.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

We have been sharing information to help the sector prepare for that scenario.#However, Mr Carmichael is standing by his claims, saying behind the scenes analysis is a totally dferent level of depth than the full impact assessment expected to be done on such a massive change.He has branded conservative ministers #woefully irresponsible# for #failing to safeguard the sector from the impact of Brexit.#Speaking while making his claims, earlier in the week, prior to the response from DEFRA, Mr Carmichael said: #When Conservatives think of farmers, they think of the big landowners and the estates This [FOI] response shows that they have no interest in, or concern for, the hill farmers and crofters whose businesses are the backbone of so many of our remote rural communities.#To run their business, farmers need certainty. They need to know what funding is available, what standards must be met and what tarfs need to be paid.#It is therefore appalling that Conservative ministers have failed to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of Brexit on sheep farming. These ministers are woefully irresponsible. Farmers deserve better.#“Behind the scenes analysis falls well short of the in-depth impact assessment that farmers and crofters deserve. It is like not doing your homework, but trying to cover the fact by saying that you put together a mind map. Simply unacceptable. By the government’s own admission, they have done nothing, and know of no work to do an impact assessment on the industry.“They have let the industry, and our farming and crofting communities down.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

FACT: Scotland has a mandate to pursue independence.” Ignoring the obvious hood that the SNP is not Scotland and cannot speak for it, it is important to establishthe Scottish people – whom the SNP says are sovereign – have authorised a second referendum in pursuit of independence. It will, after all, be upon the back of any such mandate that denial of the legal process of a Section  order from Westminster will be turned into the mother of all grievances.The chronology for the SNP claim starts six years ago when, in January , David Cameron promised a referendum on EU membershiphe were to command a majority following the  general election. As the Conservatives were in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, the party published in June  a private member’s Bill to emphasise its intentions. It passed its first and second readings in the Commons but was stopped in the House of Lords.When the  Scottish independence referendum came along the following year, there could be no doubt in anyone’s mind that a referendum to leave the EU could take place and that it would be possible for the UK to vote to leave. Nor could there be any doubt that it would be an issue for the UK to decide as the member state – and so Scottish voters might take a dferent view from the rest of the UK electorate.Indeed, so likely was this scenario to become reality that during the independence referendum the Scottish Government warned Scottish voters that remaining in the UK could mean Scotland would leave the EU against their will. It was also clear during that referendum that, were Scots to choose independence, Scotland would leave the EU the same day that it left the UK – which was being suggested by the SNP would take place before the next general election. By the SNP’s own words, it is beyond challenge that the “circumstances” of the  referendum were that the SNP was willing to take Scotland out of the EU as a price for achieving independence, and that, were Scotland to remain in the UK, it might still leave the EU later, irrespective of how Scots voted. Scots voted to stay with the UK.Once the Conservatives’  general election victory arrived, it was announced that the promised referendum would take place in June  and would be a UK-wide decision.Nicola Sturgeon, by then First Minister, had the opportunity to put at the centre of her May  Holyrood election campaign a promise to hold a second independence referendum. Instead she relegated the idea as a priority, burying it on page  with the caveat there would need to be “a signicant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in , such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will”.The Scottish public was by then getting fed-up with Sturgeon’s fixation with holding a second referendum and in May  she lost the SNP’s overall majority. The unionist parties won . per cent of the constituency vote. Together this meanteven her caveat was rejected – she had no moral or legal claim and no public mandate to hold a referendum.The next month the UK voted to leave the EU, but a majority of Scots preferred that the UK should stay. This has been claimed ever since as a “material change” of circumstances that justies the SNP Government demanding the authority to call a second independence referendum. Only it is no such thing.As I have explained above, the possibility of the UK leaving the EU with the majority of Scots opposed was already well known and foreseen the fact that it materialised was not therefore a change – the circumstance had always been there. Furthermore, the SNP had advocated the very same outcome as the price of Scottish independence two years before . The following June, we then had the  general election, by which time Sturgeon had gone on, and on, and on about a second referendum. The result was her party lost . per cent of votes and  MPs. There could be no doubt that with some . per cent of votes going to unionist parties the Scottish public was in no mood for another referendum – be it about Scotland in the UK or the UK in the EU. It is said there is a mandate because the Scottish Parliament passed a motion in favour of being able to hold a referendum, but MSPs voting for their own policies does not make it a mandate from the Scottish people.There is a way round the claims and counter-claims about the existence of a mandate for a second independence referendum. All Sturgeon has to do is go to the country. She can call time on her minority administration and hold fresh parliamentary elections to show once and for all that the Scottish people will not put up with being “dragged” out of the EU. Every party will need to state, for the avoidance of doubt,they will subsequently vote in Holyrood to call a referendum.If Sturgeon is then able to form a new administration, with or without the support of the Greens, she will have an unimpeachable claim that a Section  order to hold a legal referendum should be granted. Westminster would find it dficult to deny one in such circumstances. If Sturgeon is defeated then a new administration could be formed – but without the prospect of a referendum dominating every issue to the detriment of Scotland’s governance.So, what’s it to be, First Minister  Will you put your faith in your fellow Scots to back you ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit snp reveals wording of pro independence amendment","story":"The SNP will seek a vote in the House of Commons on an amendment stating that #the best future for Scotland# is with independence and membership of the EU.Nationalists will back the amendment to a motion putting forward Theresa May’s Brexit deal on Tuesday night,it is selected by the Commons Speaker.window.twttr : Brexit: Theresa May secures ‘legally binding’ EU dealIn previous Brexit votes, as the third party at Westminster, the SNP have had their amendments selected by John Bercow.The amendment will be opposed by Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs.

Cannot become permanent. It is only temporary. If it is the case that we were ever to get into the backstop.“The legal instrument that we have agreed is an addition to the Withdrawal Agreement. It has the same legal status as the Withdrawal Agreement. It is legally binding.“That is what Parliament asked us to secure and that is what we have secured.”Mrs May added: “MPs were clear that legal changes were needed to the backstop. Today we have secured legal changes.“Now is the time to come together to back this improved Brexit deal and to deliver on the instruction of the British people.”The legal view of the changes taken by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will be an important factor in the lead-up to the Commons vote.Mrs May said: “The Attorney General is independent. He will come to his decision. He will publish his legal opinion.”The European Commission president insisted there would be no further negotiations on the issue.Mr Juncker said: “There will be no new negotiations. It is this.“In politics, sometimes you get a second chance. It is what we do with the second chance that counts. Because there will be no third chance.“There will be no further interpretation of the interpretations and no further assurances on the reassurances.“Let us be crystal clear about the choice - it is this deal or Brexit might not happen at all.”Mrs May believes the three new documents agreed with Mr Juncker will give MPs the legally-binding reassurances they require to approve her Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future EU UK relationship.The Commons motion the PM wants MPs to back describes the first new document as “the legally binding joint instrument” relating to the Withdrawal Agreement.The Government states that the document “reduces the risk that the UK could be deliberately held in the Northern Ireland backstop indefinitely and commits the UK and EU to work to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December ”.The second new document is branded a “unilateral declaration by the UK” which sets out “the sovereign action the UK would take to provide assurance that the backstop would only be applied temporarily”.The final document is a supplement to the Political Declaration “setting out commitments by the UK and the EU to expedite the negotiation and bringing into force of their future relationship”.If the package passes the Commons, leaders of the  remaining EU states will be asked to endorse the new documents at a scheduled European Council summit in Brussels on March -, before the final step of ratication by the European Parliament.Mr Juncker said he had spoken to Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who he said had indicated he was “prepared to back this approach in the interests of an overall deal”.Mrs May’s dash to Strasbourg came amid predictions the Prime Minister was headed for a second humiliating defeat on her Withdrawal Agreement and it remains to be seenthe concessions will be enough to see it pass through Parliament.The DUP has pledged to carefully analyse the Brexit deal add-ons, remaining non-committal on whether it would now back the Withdrawal Agreement.Deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the Commons “all of this will need to be taken together and analysed very carefully”.The DUP position could be crucial in Tuesday’s Westminster debate, and not only because of the votes of its  MPs.The party’s position on the border backstop could also influence how some Tory Brexiteers approach the issue.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group, told the BBC: “It’s too early to tell definitively, but it’s clearly a step in the right direction.“It’s important to see the details, but the DUP’s support would be a very important and signicant factor.”The Prime Minister’s de facto deputy David Lidington said that the new documents gave “confirmation that the EU cannot try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely and that doing so would be an explicit breach of the legally-binding commitments that both sides have agreed”.But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed the move and called on MPs to reject the deal.He said: “The Prime Minister’s negotiations have failed.“This evening’s agreement with the European Commission does not contain anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised Parliament, and whipped her MPs to vote for.“Since her Brexit deal was so overwhelmingly rejected, the Prime Minister has recklessly run down the clock, failed to effectively negotiate with the EU and refused to find common ground for a deal Parliament could support.”The -strong Independent Group of MPs has tabled an amendment to force the PM to seek an extension of Article  to hold a so-called People’s Vote before the end of September.In a letter to EU Council president Donald Tusk, Mr Juncker left the option of an extension to Article , but only by a could of months.He said: “I would like to stress that the United Kingdom’s withdrawal should be complete before the European elections that will take place between - May this year.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll 1 in 3 scots say there should never be a second independence referendum","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A third of Scottish voters think that there should never be another referendum on independence, and  per cent think it should be delayed until at least , a new poll shows.

Eight per cent were undecided, and seven per cent said the poll should take place between five and ten years. Scottish Tory chief whip Maurice Golden reacted: “This shows a clear majority do not want another referendum any time soon. Scots are sick and tired of Nicola Sturgeon’s obsession with a referendum. They deserve a Scottish Government focused on their priorities of health and education.”SNP deputy leader Keith Brown said: “Support for independence is now higher than backing for any kind of Brexit, which is why the Tories are running scared of giving people a say on their future, because they fear they would lose.”Respondents were also asked about their voting intentions for the Scottish Parliamentary elections in .

But the only way to ensure that Scotland’s valuable natural resources are invested here in Scotland, and not squandered by Westminster, is through independence.”However Colin Clark, Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon, said the SNP had “learned nothing from recent history”.“Whenever there is a boost in production, we are all expected to believe independence is nigh. Yet when there is a downturn, it is the UK Government that must absorb the drop in revenue. - Tribunal rules that councillor’s views on Scottish independence are ‘philosophical belief’“The Scottish people rejected independence when oil was  a barrel – they are unlikely to change that view at .“The fact is that the policies of this Conservative government have kept taxes stable and encouraged investment in the North Sea.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":null,"title":"new recycling centre to create 50 new jobs","story":"Fty new jobs are being created in a new recycling centre in Ballymena by a leading social enterprise that finds work for people with disabilities and long term health conditions.Ulster Supported Employment Ltdhas opened new , sq. ft premises in Ballymena as part of its continuing growth in recycling, creating environmentally friendly products and sustainable employment.The new venture will expand the company’s recycling capacity by  per cent, increasing from , tonnes of material each year to  tonnes.

Professor Maura McAdam, who is from Banbridge, will work with researchers from Norway, Israel, Sweden and Ireland on the three-year project entitled Overcoming the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Gender Divide: A Cross-Cultural Perspective to provide an understanding of how gender is a decisive factor in women’s participation in entrepreneurship, with a focus on women in technology.It will generate new insights and knowledge whilst providing tools to visualise and challenge underlying gender imbalances that inhibit the process of innovation in entrepreneurship. It is hoped that a cross-cultural comparison between the four partner countries will help to explain iations and similarities with regard to gender in entrepreneurship ecosystems. The funding was awarded under Gender-Net Plus, an EU-funded initiative that aims to strengthen links between researchers in dferent countries, and support gender equality through institutional change.Professor Maura McAdam, Professor of Management and Director of Entrepreneurship at DCU’s Business School said: “There is an assumption that all entrepreneurs have equal access to resources, participation and support, as well as an equal chance of a successful outcome. However, my latest research shows that women are underrepresented in successful entrepreneurial ecosystems, and that a persistent gender bias continues to exist in entrepreneurship discourse and practice. I am delighted to take the lead on this project and look forward to working with all of my international colleagues to ultimately help attain gender equality in the entrepreneurship domain in particular and also within broader society.”Police investigating child arrest Facebook footageTen-year animal ban for man who kept dogs in ‘unsuitable’ state Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"special exhibition celebrating tech","story":"Southern Regional College is hosting a special exhibition event to celebrate the achievements which the Banbridge campus has made over the past  years.Building work on the new £ million state-of-the-art SRC Banbridge campus, scheduled to open in September , is already well under way and this unique event will give former students, staff, associates and members of the public a unique opportunity to say a final farewell to the ‘old’ campus on Castlewellan Road.A rear view of the old library and technical college following its extension in  which remains in existence today.The event, which is open to everyone, takes place on Tuesday, March  at pm and will incorporate a special exhibition to celebrate the Ccollege’s proud history, legacy and successes.

It honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“If we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not a template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally-binding changes were needed to set that right. We have now agreed them.“The EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely which can be challenged.“Now it is time to come together and back this improved deal.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the new agreements were an “unambiguous statement” of both sides’ “good faith and intentions” but also made it clear they did not undermine the principle of the backstop.“We have insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be rewritten, and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that can achieve the same objective, namely no hard border,” he said.“However, we have also said that we were prepared to offer guarantees and further reassurances and to the UK of our good faith and intentions – indeed we have offered such reassurances on many occasions.“The Instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed. “It does not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application. “It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the Protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met. “The documents agreed yesterday reiterate our wish to establish a future partnership with the UK that is as close as possible, and marks our commitment to ensure that negotiations on that future relationship can begin as soon as the UK leaves. “The instrument agreed sets out how we will go about this important work. “In many ways, Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months, and particularly the threat of no deal. A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the European Union. “We now need to see the Withdrawal Agreement ratied by Westminster and by the European Parliament without further delay, so that we can get on with the important work of building the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, and between the UK and Ireland, post Brexit. “I know feel that for the remains of the day, we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what#s now on the table.” All eyes now turn to UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who will later today give his considered assessment of whether what Mrs May has secured is legally binding. His response is expected to be key in deciding what way Brexit hardliners – notably Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ERG and the DUP – will vote this evening.

negotiator Jean-Claude Juncker on the phone.During a Dublin press conference on Tuesday morning Mr Varadkar said: “In the context of tonight’s vote in Westminster, the outcome from yesterday’s meeting with Prime Minister May and President Juncker is positive.“I hope and trust that the withdrawal agreement will now be endorsed by the House of Commons.”He was due to fly to the US on Monday evening for his annual St Patrick’s celebration trip, but his plans were changed at the last minute to accommodate Monday’s unscheduled cabinet meeting.The Democratic Unionists’  MPs prop up Theresa May’s minority Government and they have repeatedly called for legal guarantees around any deal before they can support it.The Taoiseach said: “The instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed.“It does not reopen the withdrawal agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application.“It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the protocol , particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met.”He said the Irish Government was committed to exploring alternatives to the insurance policy in a timely way, in the event that the overall future relationship cannot be concluded in a satisfactory and timely manner.Mr Varadkar warned: “But it does not call into question that the backstop will apply unless and until better arrangements are agreed, with all parties using good faith and best endeavours to that aim.”He said the newly-agreed texts recalled the dispute resolution mechanisms in the Withdrawal Agreement that could be invoked were either party to demonstrate bad faith, including the possibility of seeking a ruling from a  of arbitrators.“I hope that, together with the joint statement on the political declaration, it will provide a basis on which we can move forward again.”Mr Varadkar said the threat of the UK leaving the EU with no deal had been a dark cloud for many months.“A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the EU.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ira claims responsibility for explosive packages","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

The Commons should reject it. https:t.co GIWdhPBh— Nicola SturgeonMarch , .amShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Attorney General Geoffrey Cox should make a Commons statement setting out his legal advice around the latest amendments.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “I think, on the basis of the documents – and he will have analysed them last time in great detail, he will analyse them again –he concludes that there isn’t signicant change I really don’t see that there is a basis for him to change his advice.”He added: “He has said ‘I’m very happy to answer questions’, this is all happening at the eleventh hour, so we do need him in the House of Commons making a statement and then MPs across the House can ask him – whichever way he goes on his advice – why he has done it.”Having studied the documents, I would be surprisedthey are sufficient to enable the Attorney General to change the central plank of his December legal advice.  — Keir StarmerMarch , "},{"url":null,"title":"explained what is theresa mays new brexit deal and what happens next","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The first is a “joint instrument” that relates to the Withdrawal Agreement. The PM said it reduces the risk that the UK could be “deliberately held in the Northern Ireland backstop indefinitely”.The second is a “unilateral declaration” by the UK which sets out “the sovereign action the UK would take to provide assurance that the backstop would only be applied temporarily”. The third is a supplement to the Political Declaration “setting out commitments by the UK and the EU to expedite the negotiation and bringing into force of their future relationship”.– What does all that mean The joint instrument gives Britain the ability to suspend the backstopthe EU is deemed to have deliberately applied it indefinitely, although the UK would have to win the backing of an independent arbitration body to do so. The unilateral declaration is a statement on the record that the UK can “instigate measures” to remove itself from the backstoptalks break down.This could carry legal weightit is lodged with the United Nations without formal objection by the EU. The supplement to the declaration states the intention that both sides will set about finding an alternative to the backstop as soon as possible.Our agreement provides meaningful clarications  legal guarantees to the Withdrawal Agreement  #backstop. The choice is clear: it is this deal, or #Brexit may not happen at all. Let’s bring the UK’s withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history. https:t.co lfyeehEZi pic XCqcLwZVV— Jean-Claude JunckerMarch , – Will it satisfy those who opposed the deal first time round The Democratic Unionist Partyrejected the deal before over fears the backstop,activated, would create a customs border between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. The European Research Groupof Brexiteer Tory MPs also rejected it because they feared the backstop would keep the UK too closely bound to the EU and unable to strike trade deals with non-EU countries. They demanded the backstop was either removed completely from the Withdrawal Agreement or subject to a time limit. Neither of those demands have been met, although the UK does now have the ability to suspend the backstop with the arbitration body’s agreement.pic WumrAn— Nigel DoddsMarch , – What have they had to say about it The DUP said they will be taking “appropriate advice” and “scrutinising the text line by line” before forming their own judgement. The ERG’s lawyers will be doing the same. Tory MP Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and member of the group, told the BBC that “even by the Government’s own standards I think this falls very far short of what the Government whipped us to vote for”.– Are they likely to reject it again For the DUP it is important that any Brexit deal does not effectively separate Northern Ireland from the UK, while Brexiteers want to leave the EU and take advantage of the ability to trade freely with non-EU countries. For the DUP the backstop could present an existential threat, while for the Brexiteers it would hobble what they see as an opportunity for a more prosperous le outside the bloc.The DUP may stick to their red line as a matter of principlethey deem the PMs changes to be insufficient. Brexiteers could also reject the changed deal on grounds that the alterations do not go far enough. However doing so could imperil the thing Eurosceptics want overall – to leave the EU – as rejection could lead to a delay to Brexit and raise the chances of second referendum.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Countdown to leaving the EU – How about Labour and The Independent Groupof MPs Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Prime Minister’s negotiations had failed as the new agreement does not contain “anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised Parliament, and whipped her MPs to vote for”. He said MPs “must reject this deal”. TIG MP Chris Leslie said it was tabling an amendment to the motion that will force the PM to seek an extension to Article  for a so-called People’s Vote.– Will the EU consider any more changes or allow Brexit to be delayed On Monday Mr Juncker stated that there will be “no third chance” for more negotiations. He did, however, leave open the option for an extension to Article  – although only until European Parliament elections are held in late May."},{"url":null,"title":"new ira admit responsibility for letter bombs sent to london and glasgow","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No legislation that puts them above the law and no deviation from the legacy mechanisms agreed at Stormont House five years ago.\"Mr McCartney concluded: “These mechanisms need to be enacted and the Stormont House Agreement implemented as the only way to deal with the legacy issue.”"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxNVxcXC8xMVxcXC8xOTA3MzUxMVxcXC9TY3JlZW4tU2hvdC0yMDE1LTExLTE5LWF0LTcuMzQuNTAtYS5tLi5wbmdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC9jYWNoZS5yZXNpemVkLmNvXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJkY2VhM2ZkMzAzMDk3OTZiMWRmYTk3MjBiNzA5NTljMzI0ODBlMjk4In0=/screen-shot-2015-11-19-at-7-34-50-a-m.png","title":"winning numbers weeks derry city fc lotto draw","story":"Winning numbers in this weeks Derry City Football Lotto draw are - , , , .

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced.

However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass.

Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

If this is the first time you have subscribed to emails from JPIMedia Ltd, the publishers of Belfast Newsletter, please check your inbox to very your email address.  .html.valThe government has secured #legally-binding# changes to the Brexit deal after Theresa May made a last-minute dash to Strasbourg for talks on the eve of a crucial vote in the House of Commons.The prime minister’s de facto deputy David Lidington gave the update to MPs as Mrs May and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay were meeting with EU leaders.Mr Lidington said: “Tonight we will be laying two new documents in the House a joint legally-biding instrument on the Withdrawal Agreement and protocol on Northern Ireland and a joint statement to supplement the political declaration.”Mrs May then confirmed the alleged breakthrough in Strasbourg.The DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said his party would need to see what comes out of the ongoing negotiations before taking a decision on the updated Brexit deal, calling Mr Lidington’s comments a “partial statement”.He said: “He’s outlined two documents which he is going to publish, but there are still negotiations under way, as he told the House. So can he give an indication to when he thinks those negotiations, that element of the negotiations, which are extremely important, when they are likely to be concluded and when the House is likely to be updated ”Mr Lidington said of the two new documents: “The first provides confirmation that the EU cannot try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely and that doing so would be an explicit breach of the legally-binding commitments that both sides have agreed.”He said the “joint instrument” reflects the commitment to “replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December ”.Mr Lidington added the attorney general would be publishing advice ahead of today’s debate, but needed time to consider the new changes.“The attorney general will publish his legal opinion,” he said. “That will be available in good time before the debate.”The last-ditch bid to make progress in talks came amid predictions the prime minister was headed for a second humiliating defeat on her Withdrawal Agreement and it remains to be seenthe concessions will be enough to see it pass through Parliament.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the change “adds nothing” from the letter Mrs May ed from negotiations with on January .MrsMay’s said in Strasbourg: “The deal honours the referendum result and is good for both the UK and the EU.RHI: Government pulls vote after Lord Empey makes last-ditch bid to delay huge subsidy cuts Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“But there was a clear concern in Parliament over one issue in particular: the Northern Ireland backstop.“Having an insurance policy to guarantee that there will never be a hard border in Northern Ireland is absolutely right — it honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“Butwe ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not the template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear — and legally binding changes were needed to set that right.“Today we have agreed them. First, a joint instrument with comparable legal weight to the Withdrawal Agreement will guarantee that the EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely.“If they do, it can be challenged through arbitration andthey are found to be in breach the UK can suspend the backstop. The joint instrument also gives a legal commitment that whatever replaces the backstop does not need to replicate it.“And it entrenches in legally binding form the commitments made in the exchange of letters with Presidents Tusk and Juncker in January.”She added: “Second, the UK and the EU have made a joint statement in relation to the Political Declaration.“It sets out a number of commitments to enhance and expedite the process of negotiating and bringing into force the future relationship.“And it makes a legal commitment that the UK and the EU will begin work immediately to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by the end of December .”Mr Dodds said that “all of this will need to be taken together and analysed very carefully, because we’re speaking at the moment without having had sight of the precise text”.In response, Mr Lidington said he “completely understands” the wish for detailed analysis.try catch  TrendingStorm Gareth worse than originally thought - N.I. to be pummelled by mph galesNewry murders: Distraught father will lsquosell taxirsquo for chance to say goodbyePolice not seeking anyone  in connection with Newry deathsN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellN.I.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range.

What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Speaking about the move to its new headquarters in Merchant Square – a £m, , sq ft office – Mr Terrington said:“We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.”On the current political uncertainty, he says: “The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.”Meanwhile, lettings in Belfast are expected to remain buoyant this year despite the uncertain political climate, according to a report from Lambert Smith Hampton. That’s been buoyed by PwC’s pre-letting of the Merchant Square development, which is currently under construction.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.
