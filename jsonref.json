A spokesperson yesterday said the virus is now being viewed in No10 like any other respiratory illness.\u0027There is no change to our guidance and our living with Covid plan still stands,\u0027 they said.\u0027Thanks to a combination of vaccination and treatment and our better understanding of the virus we are now able to manage it as we do with other respiratory infections, so that remains the case with our approach.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Author Phil Dampier gives view new book Queens dresser Prince Harrys upcoming memoir","story":"Share this article She added Prince Charles\u0027 estranged son, who resides in California with his wife Meghan Markle, 40 and their children, Archie and Lilibet, is likely to voice his frustration in his memoirs.Brown, who penned the Diana Chronicles in 2006, said: \u0027William was disgusted about Meghan’s attack on Kate because she can’t answer back.

With such easy pickings available, the virus ignores human cells and instead latches on to the decoys.The therapy would be particularly helpful for viruses like Covid-19 which mutate frequently, to get around drugs and vaccines. But because the receptor remains the same, the virus would still be drawn to the decoys.“For the virus to get into a cell, it has to bind to the ACE2 receptor,” said Dr Joshua Leonard, co-senior author of the study of Northwestern, Illinois. “Decoy nanoparticles present an evolutionary challenge for Covid-19. The virus would have to come up with an entirely different way to enter cells in order to avoid the need to use ACE2 receptors. There is no obvious evolutionary escape route.“We showed that decoy nanoparticles are effective inhibitors of all different viral variants. Even variants that escape other drugs did not escape our decoy nanoparticles.”To design the decoy nanoparticles, the team made use of tiny particles, called extracellular vesicles, which are naturally released from the cells.They engineered cells producing these particles to overexpress the gene for ACE2, leading to many ACE2 receptors on the particles’ surfaces. When Covid-19 came into contact with the decoy, it bonded tightly to these receptors allowing the nanoparticles to soak up the virus like a sponge, preventing it from infecting the rest of the body.Although the technique has only been tried in a lab, it was found to be 50 times more effective than current antivirals at combating viral mutations, and 1,500 times more effective when the mutant was specifically designed to resist treatment. As well as the original Wuhan Covid strain,the treatment was found to work on beta, delta, delta-plus and lambda variants. “As we were conducting the study, different variants kept popping up around the world,” said Dr Neha Kamat, also a co-senior author of the study. “We kept testing our decoys against the new variants, and they just kept working. It’s very effective.”Although more research and clinical evaluations are needed, the researchers believe decoy nanoparticle infusions someday could potentially be used to treat patients with severe or prolonged viral infections.The research was published in the journal Small.  More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Joe Biden accuses Vladimir Putin of genocideNew York subway shooting: Gun violence ‘has to end now’, declares governorPrince Charles urges world to use less plastic as we are \u0026#39literally poisoning ourselves\u0026#39Boris Johnson says people have ‘right to expect better’ after ‘partygate’ fineThe NHS model has failed.

A random high is possible but seems unlikely.“A consequence of the lockdown with sudden increased exposure to the causative agent in a non-immune population seems the most plausible explanation.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Joe Biden accuses Vladimir Putin of genocideNew York subway shooting: Gun violence ‘has to end now’, declares governorPrince Charles urges world to use less plastic as we are \u0026#39literally poisoning ourselves\u0026#39Boris Johnson says people have ‘right to expect better’ after ‘partygate’ fineThe NHS model has failed.

Many of these species are declining and need our help. “At Trumpington Meadows nature reserve, we have a large area close to the houses where visitors are welcome to let their dogs run off lead as long as they are under control, but around the pond and in the meadows to the south it is essential to keep dogs on lead and stick to the path. “Many of these birds’ nests are well camouflaged – you wouldn’t even know they were there until it’s too late. It’s really important to pay attention to the signs, both at Trumpington and elsewhere.”Alan Wright, a colleague in Lancashire, echoed the sentiment and told The : “Curlew, lapwing and little ringed plover nest on Little Woolden Moss, in Salford, and we often find dogs have chased away parent birds or killed chicks.“We have also had major problems on our urban reserve Foxhill Bank, in Oswaldtwistle, where volunteering has had to stop for periods because of health issues associated with dog mess. I am a dog owner and I keep my dog under control, it isn\u0027t difficult.”Similar problems have also been reported in Northumberland, where birds were chased by off-lead dogs at Whitley Bay. The charity was also forced to install gates at Weetslade Country Park reserve, on the outskirts of Newcastle, to keep dogs out and let resident skylarks breed in peace. Conservationists at Alderney, Cumbria and Gwent were among the others to raise concerns with their national head office that dogs were causing havoc for the local fauna. Wildlife trusts are urging members of the public to pay particular heed when on nature reserves or in designated protected areas but are also encouraging people to stick to walking dogs on a lead in all outdoor spaces because birds may be nesting anywhere. James Byrne, the landscapes recovery programme manager for The Wildlife Trusts, says: “Allowing dogs to run wild in nature reserves can be devastating for wildlife, particularly in spring when species are breeding and vulnerable. “We’re asking dog walkers to be sensitive by keeping their animals on short leads, sticking to paths, and properly disposing of dog poo. Wildlife is already under enormous pressure – let’s all keep dogs in check so as not to make things worse.” As well as protecting birds, the charity says ensuring all dogs are on short leads has other benefits, such as restricting the area affected by canine urine and faeces stopping dogs swimming lakes and waters, which can disturb aquatic life and pollute the water and reducing the risk of attacks on wild animals and livestock from pets. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Joe Biden accuses Vladimir Putin of genocideNew York subway shooting: Gun violence ‘has to end now’, declares governorPrince Charles urges world to use less plastic as we are \u0026#39literally poisoning ourselves\u0026#39Boris Johnson says people have ‘right to expect better’ after ‘partygate’ fineThe NHS model has failed.

The factory worker and father-of-two died in May , at the height of the first lockdown, after spending  nights in a coma.She was among bereaved relatives to tell Boris Johnson : “We couldn’t comfort each other at our loved ones’ funerals.“We couldn’t hold our loved ones’ hands whilst they passed away. We couldn’t visit our loved ones’ when they needed us the most.  “Every single day this is something we have to live with, all because we obeyed the rules that were there to stop others from experiencing our pain. You on the other hand did not. “You broke those laws intended to keep us safe. You trampled on the sacrices we and all the British public made. You paid a fine. Our loved ones paid with their lives.” Another relative said those who say now is not the right time for a change of leadership “couldn’t be more wrong”.Rivka Gottlieb, , of North London, who lost her father Michael to Covid aged  in April , said she feels “absolutely livid” and “disgusted” at the lack of honesty from those in charge of the country. Mr Johnson “lost his moral authority a long time ago” and his position is “untenable”, she said.Ms Gottlieb, who is a member of the Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice group, said: “I feel like I’m watching a car crash in slow motion over and over again, and I’ve been saying this for months: the ineptitude and lack of integrity at the top has led us into this place. “This is the leadership that got us into this mess.

The Conservatives have traditionally enjoyed huge support among OAPs - often skewing policies which can favour the old over the young. But the over-s’ free TV licences betrayal and manesto-breaking suspension of the pensions triple lock has triggered a furious revolt. Campaign group Silver Voices told its , members: “The votes of older people have been taken for granted by the Conservatives we are being treated with disdain.” Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter Speaking ahead of the May  local elections, director Dennis Reed told the Mirror: The Conservatives have let down older people and their broken promises have left us swinging, without support, in the cost-of-living storm.  “The Tories have relied on older voters to get them over the line in previous elections, but many have withdrawn support since the triple lock on state pensions was suspended, free TV licences scrapped and the social care crisis left unresolved. “Senior citizens are fed up to the back teeth with their votes being taken for granted by the Government and the Tories will find the ‘silver vote’ will go where in the May local elections.“Our memories are long and broken promises will be punished.”The Government has temporarily abandoned the triple lock, which guarantees that pensions rise by whichever is the highest of average earnings, inflation or .%.Last Septemberaposs inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index - which is used to set the next April’s rise - was .%.  But a big post-pandemic climb in average earnings would have meant pensions soaring by %, so the lock was suspended for a year. However, inflation is now running at .% and tipped to surge beyond % later this year. The .% rise in pensions came into force this week. Age UK’s charity director Caroline Abrahams said: With inflation now running at more than %, the % rise in the State Pension looks extremely mean. “To make things worse, the Governmentaposs response to crippling price rises in their recent Spring Statement was feeble, to say the least, leaving anyone on a low fixed income, including millions of pensioners, desperately worried about how to keep on top of their bills.  Decisions like these leave ministers looking out of touch with the dficult realities of ordinary peopleaposs lives, becauseyou are retired and dependent largely or wholly on a State Pension, without many savings to fall back on, then you donapost have any wriggle room when your everyday costs are going up so fast.” The .% rise which kicked in this week also meant welfare benefits rose by half the current rate of inflation. Emma Revie, chief executive at the Trussell Trust foodbank network, said: “We are deeply concerned about the consequences of today’s benefits changes. “This is a real-terms cut for millions of people on the very lowest incomes, during the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. “Right now, too many families are already making impossible decisions between heating and eating, and we know people are skipping meals, unable to afford to run cookers and fridges and taking on debt to buy the essentials.”  A Government spokesman said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we’re providing support worth £billion across the next financial year and, as was approved by Parliament, benefits are being uprated by the usual measure, September’s inflation figure. “Our package of support includes putting an average of £, more per year into the pockets of working families via changes to Universal Credit, cutting fuel duty and helping households with their energy bills. “We have also boosted the minimum wage by more than £, a year for full-time workers, are raising National Insurance thresholds so people keep more of what they earn and we continue to work with stakeholders and others to increase awareness of Pension Credit.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PoliticsTV LicensingPensionsDepartment for Work and PensionsThe economySocial CareLocal elections\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Conservative MPs were furious that the Defra board member, the brother of government minister Zac Goldsmith, said the activists were right to do whatever it takes. Hundreds of anti-fossil fuel protestors have been arrested in recent days with police criticising their exceptionally dangerous road-blocking tactics. The millionaire financier criticised Labouraposs call for nationwide injunctions against aposJust Stop Oilapos protests which have caused chaos at petrol stations.Mr Goldsmith tweeted: Not a good look from Labour. The protestors are right to be doing whatever it takes to wake people up. The fossil fuel industry is grubby and dangerous. We need to unhook ourselves from our dependence asap. But West Dorset Tory MP Chris Loder accused Mr Goldsmith of inappropriately interfering in political matters and claimed he was hanging on to his brother’s coat-tails at Defra.He tweeted: He should either resign and stand for election or be sacked by [Environment Secretary] George Eustice.Another example below of his misuse of power in campaigns.Fay Jones, Tory MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, described his words as unbelievable in a backbenchers W hatsapp group, while former cabinet minister Damian Green said surely he canapost stay on after that.Mr Goldsmith later deleted his remarks, telling furious Tory MPs on whatsapp that he was “sorry for my clumsy tweets about Extinction Rebellion.He then tweeted: I recognise the disruption these protests are causing to peopleaposs lives and livelihoods. Iaposve always previously stood publicly opposed to the controversial and often bonkers methods employed by ER. But he added: That being said, I know Iaposm not alone in feeling a rising sense of panic as the reported science grows ever grimmer. Awareness and action are not commensurate with the scale of the issue, evenwe in the UK are now leading the way globally. A government source said: “Ben expressed a personal view - not that of the Government.  People have the right to protest, and the issue of climate change is very important - that’s why we’re taking such ambitious action to tackle it. But, these XR protests are not peaceful protest - they are disrupting people’s lives and it is wholly unacceptable. That’s why the Government is taking robust action to stop them.” Extinction Rebellion blocked all entrances to the Lloyds of London on Tuesday in an attempt to stop them insuring fossil fuels projects. At the weekend, the activists blocked cars and buses from passing across two central London bridges, although ambulances were allowed to pass.

Michael Fabricant sparked fury with his defence of Boris Johnson after the Prime Minister, his we and Rishi Sunak were fined for partygate on Tuesday. The Prime Minister has paid a fine in relation to the gathering in the Cabinet Room on June , , to mark his th birthday - as it was a violation of coronavirus rules. The Lichfield MP said he thought that Mr Johnson would have to come to the Commons on Tuesday, when parliament s after the Easter holiday, to apologise. He went on to say: Having said that, I don’t think that at any time [Johnson] thought that he was breaking the law. I think that at the time he thought, just like many teachers and nurses who after a very, very long sht would tend to go back to the staff room and have a quiet drink - which is more or less what he has done. Mr Fabricant added: But I don’t think he thought he was breaking the law. But of course that doesn’t make any sort of excuse.  The comments have prompted backlash from The Royal College of Nursing , which has called the remarks “factually incorrect”. Writing to Mr Johnson, Pat Cullen, general secretary of the RCN, said: We remain at the forefront of pandemic response. Despite political narrative, as health and care professionals we know the Covid- context is nowhere near over. “While you position yourself with some authority as to the behaviour and actions of nurses during the pandemic, Iaposd like to inform you of the following facts. Throughout the pandemic - and still certainly, now - most days, nurses and nursing support workers, when finally finishing a number of unpaid hours well past sht end, will get home, clean their unorms, shower and collapse into bed. Throughout the early pandemic, this was often alone, for the protection of others - kept away from family, friends and support networks. These shts - in communities, in hospitals, anywhere people are - are long, unrelenting, understaffed and intense.At the end of one of the many hours, days and years we have worked, since recognition of the pandemic, I can assure you that none of us have sought to hang out and aposhave a quiet one in the staff room.apos There isnapost a site in England that would allow alcohol on the premises for any professional to consume during working hours. As frontline professionals, still dealing with the implications of the pandemic - understaffed, underpaid, overworked, exhausted, burnt out and still holding it together while doing the best we can for our patients. It is utterly demoralising - and factually incorrect - to hear you suggest that our diligent, safety critical profession can reasonably be compared to any elected official breaking the law, at any time.Speaking of the June  incident, the Prime Minister said it initially did not occur to him that the gathering in the Cabinet Room to mark his th birthday was a violation of coronavirus rules.He described it as an occasion for people I work with to pass on their good wishes - and said he didnapost realise at the time that the party broke the rules.However, he said that after being issued with a fine as part of a politan Police investigation into alleged parties at the heart of the Government during the pandemic he now humbly accepts he did breach Covid- laws.Scotland Yard, according to a statement published by No , said Mr Johnson had been fined because on June   at the Cabinet Room.... between  and  he had been part of a gathering of two or more people indoors, which was banned at the time. The Prime Minister, speaking to broadcasters at Chequers, said he fully respects the outcome of the police investigation and that he accepted in all sincerity that people had the right to expect better from him. However he dodged questions over whether he would resign, instead insisting he wanted to get on with the job. This was echoed by Mr Sunak. Labour has joined the chorus of demands for the Commons to be recalled from its two-week Easter break and allow Mr Johnson to tender his resignation in person to MPs.It comes as a snap YouGov poll of , adults taken on Tuesday found that % of people think the Prime Minister should go, with the same proportion thinking the same about the Chancellor.

Some of his best realistic cakes include a football, a cocktail, a guitar and a hot dog...A cake version of rapper Slowthai Image: collectByNatasha Wynarczyk:,  Apr |commentsA man lying on a hospital bed with his legs and arms chopped up may not be the most appetising ­image but look closely and you will see there is a large slice of illusion involved. The gruesome sight is actually a cake. The culinary version of British rapper Slowthai was created by artist Ben Cullen for the star’s music video Feel Away. And the realistic chunk of sponge and vanilla is just one of hundreds he has made. Others include a hot dog, trainers, burgers, footballs, ­cocktails, chicken and an electric guitar he made for his birthday. Chester-based Ben, , said: “I love the idea of trying to trick people and making ­sculptures from my cakes.  “For me, it’s about how far you can take it. How realistic and uncake-like you can make the objects. I am obsessed with it.”Illusion cakes have become a huge trend, recently buoyed by the popularity of Netflix gameshow Is It Cake , where bakers ­replicate common objects for a £, prize.And a Sainsbury tie-in with the Great British Bake Off produced a series of adverts asking viewers to guess whether food such as a loaf of crusty bread or a steak was cake or not cake ”. Those were baked by Ben. His creations take on average three days to make and sell for up to £,. Ben has provided treats for the likes of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and Rita Ora.  You would think he has been baking for ages but he only started in . He said: “I wasn’t interested in it at all when I was younger. It has been a bit of a surprising career choice for me. “But I always wanted to be an artist and when I saw it was possible to make art out of cakes, I started doing it straight away. “I’d love to have my own TV show. My biggest aim is to do a house made from cake, where everything inside it is edible.” Here, Ben shares some of the secrets behind his amazing creations… Burger and chips Shades and colouring have to be exactly right. Ben says: “Objects have a lot of dferent tones, they’re not just one colour. “For this burger and chips, I mixed ious edible food colouring together to get it right. “Adding a random colour, in this case blue, can help you get the right colour for the bun.”  Football For spherical objects the cake is baked in two halves then put together. Ben explains: “You have to ensure the chocolate ganache around the base is sturdy enough for you to put the top sphere on it and hold it. “To get it perfectly spherical, there’s a long process of smoothing the ganache. It is incredibly repetitive. “You also have to bear in mind that adding paste will make the object larger.”Cocktail Everything is edible, even the straw made from modelling chocolate. Ben says: “These ones are crazy hard to do. I made a real-le cocktail and put it next to me and then worked out the angle I’d shoot the cake from, then the tones I needed. “I airbrushed the food colouring for the drink itself but the base and the top of the glass I had to hand paint.” Raw chicken Ben says: “I analysed a real chicken breast and saw it had this stretched skin. By accident, I found when I got a new toothbrush, turned it on an angle and dragged it very gently, it left thin lines on the surface, like the chicken had. “I used tinfoil to create wrinkled bits and toffee sauce for the disgusting chicken juice you get.”  Hotdog Ben says texture is “one of the most important things”. He adds: “To get the hot dog bread right I wet some sugar paste then got a nail brush to twist and pull away at it. “I’ve tried hot dogs a few times and this one is the closest I’ve got to the real deal.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Piece Of CakeFoodDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fuming mum-of-three Joanne Black says she gave her £, gown to Alterations by Janice in Paisley, Scotland, at the beginning of March to have the shoulders of the frock lted and the sleeves taken up.But the -year-old told the Daily Record she was less than impressed when, five weeks later, she picked up her dress only to find that none of the adjustments had been made.The mum, who said the dress was in a garment bag when she collected it, claims she was disgusted to find it covered in dog hair, dirt and dust asit had been dragged along the ground. Joanne, who is due to tie the knot with her partner of three years, Tony, in Auchen Castle in Moffat on May , says the experience has robbed her of all her excitement in the run-up to her special day.She told the Record: Iaposve been so stressed. I didnapost sleep the night I got it back and I was crying. Itaposs stressful enough organising a wedding, but this has really put me off my dress. When I picked it up I expected to have this aposwowapos moment and to feel absolutely ecstatic, but now Iaposm totally deflated. This has taken that moment away from me. You only planned to get married once and you should be so excited about it, but itaposs totally turned the other way. On one part of the sleeve, you can literally pull the fabric and see itaposs just falling away. I have no idea what sheaposs done to the hem either... the bottom is all pinned up which I never even asked for. The dress has come back absolutely bogging. Joanne suffers from anxiety, so asked her mum to approach the shop the day after the garment was ed to go over her concerns. But the family claim Alterations by Janice refused to refund the £ Joanne paid to have the adjustments done on the grounds that she wonapost take her dress back into the shop to be fixed.  With time ticking on, Joanne has now had to borrow money from her aunt and book in with another alteration service in Glasgow, leaving her a further £ out of pocket - another blow to her aposbudget weddingapos. Joanne continued: Even when I had my dress on to get altered in the shop, the owneraposs dog was walking all over the bottom of it. She says she makes her customers aware that thereaposs a dog, but she didnapost make me aware. If I was told that detail, I wouldnapost have picked that shop. My heart was racing and my palms were sweating. I felt so uncomfortable and I just couldnapost wait to get out of there. It was a terrible experience. Looking back, I shouldaposve just taken my business where, but I donapost like confrontation. When I went to the new shop in Glasgow with my dress, they couldnapost believe the mess of it. Joanne now plans to pursue the matter with Trading Standards in the hope of getting her money back. She added: Iaposm not leaving this. Iaposve got three kids and Iaposve not got a lot of money to throw about. The Mirror contacted Alterations by Janice but a staff member said no one was available to comment, and declined to give any further response to Joanneaposs complaint.

Sunseeking Brits looking to head overseas for a much-needed break are being warned to plan ahead as thousands are rocking up without the Covid certication they need to get to their destination.In Britain, the Government has scrapped all of its previous travel rules from Covid tests to qurantine periods, while other countries have also begun to lt their restrictions. France recently reopened to unvaccinated Brits for holidays, with no quarantine requirements, while anyone aged  or over can visit Spain provided they are either fully vaccinated against Covid, or can show proof of recent recovery.However, the rules are dferent for each country and the many still have restrictions in place, as holidaymakers are finding out to their dismay.  Many still require a negative test result - something a number of Brit travellers appear not to realise. Not only have they had to pay up to £ for last minute testing, passengers have risked missing their flight as they wait in long queues at airports that are already under strain due to staff shortages and a particularly busy Easter period.Nick Markham, co-founder of Cignpost ExpressTest, who offer Covid testing at a number of UK airports, told Travel Weekly that Brit holidaymakers were turning up weithout the correct Covid test certication for their intended destination.He said: “Because the UK government has lted all Covid restrictions, people naturally assume that all testing everywhere has ended.  “However, many countries still have some level of Covid testing in place for arrivals. They include the US, which requires all travellers to take a negative Covid test no more than  hours before they fly, and most of Europe’s short haul destinations, which have testing rules for arrivals who are not fully vaccinated, often including children aged  and over.” If you want to travel to the United States, you must provide a negative Covid test  hours before flying. While many European holiday destinations require children who are not fully vaccinatred to provide negative Covid tests to prove they are not carrying the bug.  And Brits could be stung in the wallet, with last-minute, unplanned Covid tests reportedly ranging in price from £ to as much as £results are needed urgently in a few hours. And travellers still risk missing flights waiting for results to come back or stuck waiting in long queues to do their tests.Speaking to the Sun, Mr Markham added: Airports are already under pressure with staff shortages often themselves caused by COVID infections. That could mean longer queues at check-ins or for essential purchases at the airport.So having to queue for a last-minute test and then hoping the result comes through in time could leave travellers without time to clear security and catch their flight. We are urging all holidaymakers to check the entry requirements carefully for their destination before their departure date, and to book all necessary tests at the airport or in advance to avoid any last-minute holiday regrets.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus testingHolidaysCoronavirusHeathrow Airport\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Luke, a stray mongrel, shattered hearts across the world after being stood up at a special Valentine’s Day party thrown in his honour. Finally, after  days in Battersea Brands Hatch’s care, and becoming a media sensation, Luke has found a loving new home.After hitting headlines in the UK, USA and beyond, the five-year-old dog quickly accumulated a fanbase of people, who’d generously sent him fan mail, gts and even made donations to the charity in his honour.Many people from other counties, such as America, Canada and Italy, had even offered to fly this lonely Valentine to their homes across the world.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Having spotted Luke’s story in the press and expecting him to have already been rehomed, Karl and Jill Kendrick got in touch with Battersea’s Brands Hatch centre to see what dogs were looking for a new home. Thankfully, Luke had not yet been rehomed, and after finding out a little more about the Kendricks, it was clear to see that Luke was their perfect match. Finally, Luke’s search for love has ended, and he is now living with Karl, Jill and their two daughters in Derbyshire. Although Luke had been living in kennels for quite some time, it didn’t take him long to settle in his new home- he now has his own place on the sofa and sleeps under a duvet at nighthe gets cold. Karl said “How Luke stayed in the care of Battersea for so long is a mystery to me, any new owner would have been lucky to rehome him. Since we’ve brought him home, he’s shown himself to be the perfect dog and has really settled in so quickly- we already love him so much and wouldn’t change him for the world.  “We feel so lucky to be the family who gives Luke his forever home and he has really made our family unit complete. He’ll never spend a Valentine’s Day alone again.” Battersea Brands Hatch Centre Manager, Michelle Bevan, said: “Over the years we’ve seen many of our dogs appear in the news, but we’ve never seen any of our animals capture as many hearts across the world as Luke did. From receiving love letters, to gts in the post, it’s clear to see that thousands of people fell in love with this very special boy. We’re so pleased that so many people support rescue dogs like Luke, and that he’s finally found the loving home he deserves. “At Battersea we’re lucky enough to see every single day just how special rescue animals are. They may not be perfect but they’re certainly worth a second chance at le as a much- loved pet. We invite all animal lovers, whether recue pet owners or not, to proudly champion rescue and help us make ‘Rescue’ the nation’s favourite breed.” This April, leading animal welfare charity, Battersea, is rallying animal lovers across the UK to declare their love for the wonderful, quirky rescue dogs and cats who just need a second chance in le.

Animal pet charity The Blue Cross said the dangerous health problems in the flat-faced pets are as a result of over-breeding.Now the animal charity, which was founded in , is demanding new laws to stamp out poor breeding which leads to long term health defects in the breeds. The charity wants to see new laws drawn up which will impact the appearance and availability of flat-faced breeds in the UK. Pugs and French Bulldogs are known to have health issues such as eye disease, skin disease, obstructed breathing and spinal deformities. The charity told The Sun Online it is unacceptable as the breeds are not living full and happy lives. The flat faced breeds now make up % of dogs owned in the UK and the charity wants to raise awareness of the health issues which face the pets and change the law.The animal charity believes the rise of cute advertisements on social media has prompted the rise in demand, which has lead to the increase in cases of French Bulldogs and Pugs being diagnosed with health issues. It says poor breeding is leading to the rise of French Bulldogs and Pugs with health problems.As a result, the charity is treating thousands of pets for the same health issues. Blue Cross vets claim to have treated over , brachycephalic pets for dangerous health problems. And they believe the numbers will increase as a result of more flat faced breeds being purchased over lockdown.  These vets also want breeders in the UK to be forced to have certication issued by vets to ensure their animals donapost have any health problems that could be passed down in breeding, as they do in Australia. Some French Bulldogs can be diagnosed with conditions such as pulmonic stenosis, which is where the dog has   heart murmur, a genetic in the breed. These conditions require constant monitoring of the breed and is unable to do regular exercise. Becky Thwaites, Head of Public Affairs at Blue Cross told The Sun Online : We have already started contacting MPs.Ultimately Blue Cross is determined to see the end of the poor breeding of flat faced dogs and are considering all options both legislative and non-legislative to achieve this.

While you might assume that he will one day become King Charles, there is a chance that he could end up being called a dferent name entirely. Despite the fact his first name is Charles, thereaposs a chance the Prince of Wales could opt against using this name as his reigning moniker, because of the negative connotations surrounding previous kings also called Charles.  However, this is not as unusual as you might think, as many monarchs have chosen to change their name while on the throne - including the Queenaposs father Albert, who ascended the throne using the name his middle name, King George VI. As the Prince of Walesapos full name is Charles Philip Arthur George, he could opt to use any of the four as his regnal name, however, sources close to the prince previously claimed he was considering using his third middle name, George, meaning he would reign as King George VII. Speaking to Studio  in , former royal butler Grant Harrold said: Normally royal children have two or three names. The reason is,possibly that child was to become a king or queen, they have to have a kind of pool to choose from. For example, Prince Charles,and when he becomes king, would be - people assume he would be Charles III. But he could technically be George VII because George is in his name. If Charles were to choose his first name, he would reign as King Charles III, however, royal commentators predict he will decide against this due to negative connotations surrounding the two former King Charles. Charles I, who became king in , dismissed parliament three times and resolved to rule alone four years later. He reigned without a Parliament for more than a decade, a period which was dubbed aposeleven yearsapos tyrannyapos. Following two civil wars, Charles was tried and convicted of being a apostyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy to the good people of the nationapos and was beheaded for treason on January , . His son, Charles II, lived in exile until he was crowned King of England, Ireland and Scotland in . He was popular and dubbed the Merry Monarch, changing laws brought in by Oliver Cromwell and allowing people more freedom to enjoy themselves. However, he also lived a controversial lestyle, fathering at least  illegitimate offspring. It is unlikely Prince Charles will want to take on the moniker, however, we wonapost know for sure until he ascends the throne.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

The heir to the throne will say in response to the crisis he hopes the summit will lead to a global alliance between the private, public and NGO sectors, and set out a series of solutions, from tackling, on a massive scale, plastic pollution to nations beginning to increase, enforce and finance marine protection. In a recorded message for the th Our Ocean Conference on Wednesday, lelong environmentalist Charles, , will say: What we do to the Ocean, and to Nature, we ultimately do to ourselves.As stewards of this precious planet, it is our actions, and our actions alone, that will determine its future. Outlining his five major factors needed, Charles says big business and governments need to come together after the global pandemic and find solutions to repair the global economy while taking the opportunity to tackle the climate emergency, adding: This situation is indeed dire and the consequences of inaction and ‘business as usual’ are unimaginable. We must recognize that our economic system is at the heart of the problem, precisely because it is at odds, and not in harmony with, Nature’s own “economy” however, this same economic system of ours,re-targeted, is key to the solution. His  point plan is: Firstly, by protecting at least % of the ocean by  and % by  we can help the Ocean and marine ecosystems to recuperate. Secondly, rewarding sustainable fishing practices and penalising those that are not we can incentivize better Ocean management.  Thirdly, urgently addressing plastic pollution at a massive scale. We have seen unequivocal evidence that plastics are not only polluting our waters, but are entering our food chains and our bodies. Fourth, Charles implores to reimagine the future of tourism with a healthy Ocean in mind. Finally, the heir to the throne highlights major scientic research that proves that the protection and restoration of key ocean habitats can equally play a vital role in addressing climate change. Charles said he does pray that more can be done, adding: I stand with you all in this most pressing of endeavours. The conference is being hosted by America and Palau, an archipelago of more than  Pacic Ocean islands which is the first small island developing stateto host the Our Ocean Conference. The conference’s theme is “Our Ocean, Our People, Our Prosperity,” which draws on Palau’s rich tradition as an ocean society and focuses on islander perspectives and approaches to ensuring the health of our ocean. The princeaposs speech follows his address at the recent Cop UN climate change summit staged in Glasgow, when he said the world has had enough of talking and we need to put our words and commitments into practice. Other speakers during the two-day summit will include former US President Barack Obama and the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.

A Saharan blast of hot air is expected to send the mercury rising in the coming days, just in time for the Bank Holiday - though there is still plenty of chance of more rain.In comparison, the likes of Malta, in the central Mediterranean between Sicily and the North African coast, is only forecast to reach C. Holiday favourite Greece and party capital Ibiza in the Balearics are due to enjoy  and C, respectively.  BBC meteorologist Louise Lear said the Saharan air will be pushing its way steadily north with the exception perhaps of the Northern Isles.Speaking during last nightaposs weather forecast, she added: “It looks like Wednesday will be the warmest day of the week with C or C not out of the question and a great deal of dry weather as we head towards the Easter weekend.”Jim Dale, of British Weather Services, said: The trend is for temperatures to rise.If things play out, we could be looking at C or C in the south over Easter.  Good Friday is set for temperatures up to C. Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said it will get hottest in the southeast, though parts of the north and Scotland could see some rain.The general trend is for it to turn warmer with higher pressure increasingly likely through the week and into the following week, he said. However, until mid-week, Brits will have to contend with the prospect of rain spells, according to Meteogroup. The Met Officeaposs forecast says: Showers in places Friday and Saturday, but a good deal of dry weather for most. Becoming warm, especially in the south. Its long range forecast adds: Sunday will be largely cloudy for many with some warm sunny spells, with rain mainly confined to the north and west. Perhaps dull and musty in the morning and evening, especially along western coasts with some low cloud. Windy in the northwest. Into next week remaining similar with plenty of fine, warm weather.

And instead of tartar sauce she enjoys some tarragon hollandaise sauce, a French classic which, Darren explained, is notoriously dficult to make. Itaposs also very rich, with % butter. Mushy peas are nowhere to be seen on the plate.Is Her Majesty missing out  Have your say in the comment section In a Youtube video where Darren is seen preparing her preferred style, he tells watchers: “Fish fried in all that crispy rich batter was a little bit too much for her, she preferred a more refined fish and chips.” At one point he holds up the chips and describes how they would be cut the sameand in perfect rectangulars.  He later demonstrates how they would be stacked in a little tower. Whether she asked for chips served exactly this way in unclear. He said the team would cook the royal staff the traditional battered fish and chips with mushy peas but the Queen and any guest she might have would receive the refined version, which would be finished off with a decorative flower.  Darren, who also cooked for Princess Diana and her sons, explained that the Queenaposs menu would always be written in French, so this particular dish was called Cabillard et Pommes Pont Neuf. Towards the end of the video, he tastes the dish and describes it as gorgeous, but jokingly says it needs a bit of salad cream, which he then adds. Get the latest royal news and gossip you want straight to your inbox.to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters On social media, royal fans were delighted with the culinary display, although some felt she was limiting herself with her choices. One said: “Did the Queen ever play Jenga with her chips when you stacked them up like that ” Another user said: “Looks amazing butyou served me fish and chips with only  chips I’d be fuming.” While another said: “The Queen doesnapost know what sheaposs missing: beer battered cod, deep fried chips, mushy peas, salt, vinegar, scraps. Canapost beat it.” Fish and chips isnapost the only thing the Queen has her own way of eating - as weaposve previously reported, she prefers to eat bananas with a kne and fork. The annual food budget for the Queen is a whopping £.million and includes everything from State Dinners to what the royal family eat for breakfast.As well as the Royal family, Darren has cooked for five US Presidents.

The shark is named Mahone and was first tagged off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada in October , the Express reported. The Great White Shark has since been tracked by scientists swimming up and down the north US coast. The radar has identied him multiple times along the coast of North Carolina over the past year and a half, with scientists believing the animal might be visiting the area in search of a friend. The incredible creature is one of three large great white sharks that have been tracked by researchers from OCEARCH, who track sharks across the world’s oceans using transmitters, the Express reports.Scientists use transmitters which releases a signal when a shark spends enough time at the surface of the water for satellites to accurately pick up its location. They are also tracking another Great White Shark named Ulysses. This shark is a -foot long monster weighing  poundswho was spotted off the same coast just days before Mahone on April . In addition, another -foot long,  poundGreat White dubbed Tancook was tracked near the Canadian island of the same name on April . OCEARCH recently launched a new sea expedition around North and South Carolina to investigate a theory that Great Whites migrate to the area to mate each year from all over the West Atlantic ocean.  Chief Scientist Dr Bob Hueter said: A last critical piece of the puzzle - when  where these sharks are mating - is within our grasp. “All of our science points to the area off the Carolinas in late winter as the place where the adults come together to mate, so thataposs where weaposre heading. Scientists will continue monitoring the creatures to see whether their behaviour follows a pattern. There have been more recent discoveries of the creatures prowling in pairs near Mexico’s Guadalupe Island. Scientists were surprised to find the animals patrolling waters near the island in pairs, often spending more than an hour swimming together.

The scientists want to know why the typically solitary animals were spending time together, with researchers suggesting they could be sharing information about the location of prey or hunting skills.

A distressing video appears to show the chaotic scenes aboard the JetBlue aircraft after it failed to land at the cityaposs JFK Airport, with passengers asking to be let off at Newark Liberty in New Jersey instead. As the jet waits to take off yet again in an attempt to land at the correct destination, one man is heard yelling at cabin crew: Iaposm not going back in the air! But he is told he cannot get off. A second man also begs crew members to let him off. My kids are panicking, he shouts. We gottaapos get off this plane. It’s dangerous!Have you been involved in a similar experience recently  Let us know at webnews@mirror He goes on to say: We tried to land four times already … we’re scared to fly, we wanna get off! I donapost care about JFK — itaposs our lives! People are sick back there, people are fainting, people are throwing up! A little respect for human beings! As another passenger says: Take me to jail, I donapost care, the man shouts: I don’t want to go to jail, but it’s not right! Everybody wants to get the hell off!  Others in the video can be heard saying: Arrest me, I want to get off and Iaposm scared. The incident occurred on Thursday when the flight came in from Cancun in Mexico. The plane waited on the tarmac for an hour at Newark before eventually flying the remaining distance across into the neighbouring state and landing safely.JetBlue spokesman Derek Dombrowski told the New York Post that Flight  was erted to nearby Newark due to weather over JFK.Mr Dombrowski said a customs processing issue prevented the passengers from being allowed to leave the plane at the initial airport. Without proper customs processing available for the flight at Newark, the aircraft remained on the ground for  minutes and once the weather cleared departed again for JFK where it safely landed. We apologise for the inconvenience this weather-related ersion created, Mr Dombrowski added. One man on the flight told the New York Post the passengers had been left traumatised by the ordeal. They told us that we would have to wait hours for customs at Newark or  minutes to go back to JFK - where we still had to wait hours anyway, the unnamed passenger said. JetBlue gave us  flight credits for our troubles. It comes as JetBlue and Alaska Air announced they will cut their schedules because of worker shortages meaning there will be less flights than usual this summer.

A new study has revealed failing to wash your dogaposs food bowl on a regular basis could not only affect their health, but yours too.The research, undertaken by the Food and Drug Association , investigates dog ownersapos feeding habits and evaluates the impact of FDAaposs hygiene protocols on dog food dish contamination.They found only  per cent of the  dog owners surveyed wash their dogaposs dish daily,  per cent clean it once a week, while another  per cent wash it every three months or not at all.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. The FDA states this poses signicant health risks to pets and pet owner as it create an environment where harmful bacteria, such as salmonella and listeria, can thrive.Both salmonella and listeria can cause diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps or pain, nausea in humans, with symptoms more severe in pregnant women, children, adults over the age of , and people with weakened immune systems. When it comes to food storage and preparation,  per stored dog food within . meters of human food,  per cent washed their hands after feeding and  per cent prepared their dog food on prep surfaces intended for human use. The study reads: It was found that the vast majority of study dog owners were not aware of and did not follow FDA pet food handling and storage guidelines. Response to inidual recommendations ied, however hygiene-related handling practicesshowed overall low levels of compliance.  Additionally, studies in humans regarding self-reported handwashing show an overestimation of hygiene and similar forces, including the effects of social desirability bias, could be expected in this study. Exposure to contaminated dog food can have implications for canine and human health. For example, there have been multiple outbreaks of both humans and dogs becoming ill after exposure to dog food contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. These risks may be amplied in households with children and or immunocompromised iniduals, which were over a third of respondents’ households.The FDA has set out a list of guidelines for owners to follow to lower their risk of developing an illness from contaminated pet food and treats.The FDA recommends:Buy pet food productsthat are in good condition. Check the packaging for visible signs of damage, such as dents, tears, and discolorations. Begin and end with clean hands. Both before and after handling pet food and treats, wash your hands for at least  seconds with soap and hot water. Wash pet food bowls and scooping utensils with soap and hot water after each use. Do not use your pet’s food bowl as a scooping utensil. Use a clean scoop, spoon, or cup instead. Use the scooping utensil only for scooping pet food. Throw out old or spoiled pet food in a safe way, for example, by placing it in a securely tied plastic bag in a covered trash can. Promptly refrigerate or throw out unused or leftover canned and pouched pet food. Tightly cover refrigerated pet food. Set your refrigerator to  F or below. Store dry pet food in a cool and dry place. The temperature should be less than  F. Excess heat or moisture can cause the nutrients to break down. Store dry pet food in its original bag and keep the top of the bag tightly folded down. Keep pet food in a secure location to prevent your pet from eating an entire supply at once.A statement reads: Proper storage of pet food and treats maintains the products’ nutritional value and keeps information handy in case there’s a problem. Proper storage also prevents your pet from getting into his own food and eating too much or getting into your cat’s special diet food. Overeating or eating food that is meant for another pet can lead to health problems, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or more severe conditions.

The woman named Grace, who is from the UK, shared a video over the weekend in which she said she had been attempting to put some fake tan on her face to give herself some contour - but she woke up the next morning to find she had been sleeping with her face pressed against her arm, leaving her with a patch of fake tan right in the middle of her cheek.Warning: the below video contains explicit language.

A loving nan stretched out on a bed as her granddaughter stands beside her cuddling a doll – and wielding a gun. Welcome to the Mafia childhood of a -year-old mum now living quietly in a Lancashire town. Marisa Merico’s story has been made into an explosive -part TV drama, with drug deals, shootouts and an astonishing twist. Forget the The Godfather. Bang Bang Baby is about The Grandmother – the crime boss nan, Maria, in the picture who Marisa adored. And young gun-toting Marisa herself is also portrayed in Bang Bang Baby in her former le as a Mafia princess – along with her dealer dad Emilio. A rollercoaster le that would lead to her being banged up in prison – alongside Rose West and Myra Hindley.  Now reformed with a university degree in criminology, Marisa – who was raised in Blackpool – reflects on her childhood memories of summer visits to Nonna’s flat in Milan. “She was an amazing, lovely, compassionate, beautul woman – and yet she was a criminal,” says Marisa. “To see her on screen was emotional – in the kitchen, with her apron and the food. The nonna, stuffing your face with sweets. That made me cry.” But behind the facade was a hardened crime boss nicknamed Granny Heroin – in charge of an ­infamous organised drugs gang known as ’Ndrangheta. Marisa’s Blackpool-born mum Pat had no idea about this when she met Maria’s son Emilio while working as an au pair in Milan as a teenager. Love blossomed and Marisa was born – but Pat became fearful of the family’s criminal lestyle and took Marisa back to Blackpool when she was nine. It was during summer visits to see her gran that Marisa watched vast swathes of drugs arrive at the family home. Emilio and others would sort the packages of heroin and cocaine – then wait for orders from Maria, who had a razor-sharp mind even though she couldn’t read or write. And on these visits as a teenager Marisa found herself drawn into the excitement of her gran’s le – a powerful woman in a man’s world. “Bang Bang Baby shows what the women go through and the psyche of the women who get involved,” says Marisa.  “If you look at the Sopranos, Goodfellas and The Godfather, it’s all about the men. But when police raided homes, they never used to look at the women. Then they started to realise, women are the backbone. “What my dad was doing would not have worked without my nan being involved with it. My nan was such a strong character.” At  Marisa moved to Italy and became a courier for the gang, delivering packages worth £,. She married gang henchman Bruno Merico, with whom she had daughter Lara, now . At , she ed to England and bought a home kitted out in designer furniture funded by her ill-gotten gains worth almost £ million. But Marisa, now a gran herself, paid the price for being born into what she describes as “Mafia royalty” when the long arm of the law caught up with her. Police swooped on her house in a dawn raid. Lara, then two, was taken from her and Marisa was convicted of money laundering in , spending almost four years in HMP Durham’s notorious H wing, alongside killers Myra Hindley and Rose West.Marisa, who also has a son Frank, , said: “My whole world just stopped. It was heartbreaking for my daughter. She had to go to my mum. Lara was coming to see her mummy in prison. At first, she thought it was a hospital, but as she got older the truth had to be told. “Prison was not good. I was in with Rose West and Myra Hindley. I saw Rose in the showers – an image I can’t get out of my mind. She just stood there showing everything, looking at me. It made me uncomfortable. “I didn’t ever speak to Myra Hindley. Her cell smelled awful and musty. She was a heavy smoker. I remember her coming across the landing with a walking stick – she’d had a hip operation. She just looked me up and down. “She had a horrible aura about her. If I saw her in the queue in the kitchen, I’d wait a few minutes. I just didn’t want to be near her.” Just before Marisa was released in , her grandmother was sentenced to le for a string of crimes related to her role with the Mob. Around  members of the organisation were arrested. She had lost five of her  children because of addiction to the heroin on which the family’s empire depended. Maria was later freed but spent the rest of her le under house arrest after losing her vast wealth.  Marisa was reunited with her dad and gran in  – and visited Maria several more times before she died aged  in . Marisa had been at her bedside. “It was one of the saddest times of my le. I was her favourite grandchild. She was asleep but squeezed my hand. Her last words were, ‘Be a good girl’.” And with her le of crime behind her, Marisa is doing just that. Now living in Poulton-le-Fylde near Blackpool she hopes to open an Italian restaurant on the Lancashire coast with dad Emilio, , who retrained as a chef after being freed early from a -year stretch for helping police. Alongside her will be fiancé James, , who held her hand as she watched Bang Bang Baby for the first time. Marisa, who has written an autobiography, tells how the Amazon Prime drama had her in tears. She spent seven hours telling her story to the actress who plays her – -year-old Arianna Becheroni. They hugged and cried as they discussed her rollercoaster le. Marisa said: “I’m proud that I’ve been able to turn my le around and I’m now a criminologist. My studies have helped me understand why I did certain things. It was my fault in some ways because I knew right from wrong. “I beat myself up for years but when I look at the bigger picture, I can see I was a victim of circumstances and I was taken advantage of a lot. It was because I was loyal and I loved my family. “It wasn’t about the money, power or the glamorous le. It was the love I had for my nan and my dad.”Mafia Princess, published by Harper Collins, is on Amazon and in bookstores.

The country’s Attorney General’s Office allayed fears the Met Police decision would impact on the separate inquiry being led by prosecutors on the Algarve, insisting today: “It continues.” And Portuguese police sources said closing their long-running ‘cold case’ review was “completely out of the question.” It was reported last month the Met’s Operation Grange inquiry - launched four years after Madeleine vanished from her family apartment in Praia da Luz on May ,  - would be wound down around autumn after funding stopped.The move has been linked to the feeling among police chiefs German authorities have insufficient evidence to bring a case against prime Maddie suspect Christian Brueckner. Sources close to the inquiry in Portugal admitted they would not be surprised by the closure of the UK Madeleine probe once current funding ended and confirmed it had been a “long time” since the last official British request for information. One said: “Only the German authorities have been sending formal requests for judicial assistance of late.” A spokesman for Portugal’s Attorney General’s Office, asked about the future of the probe led by a prosecutor based in the Algarve resort of Portimao, said: “The investigation is proceeding, with the inquiry not having a final conclusion yet.” Fears the opportunity to get justice for Maddie and her parents could be dealt a hammer blow in a little over three weeks’ time despite the continuing Portuguese probe have been raised. The family’s lawyer Rogerio Alves warned in July  his country’s -year limit on prosecutions meant there was less than two years left to take action against chief suspect Christian Brueckner.  And Portuguese legal experts admitted at the weekend the chances of putting anyone behind bars over Madeleine’s disappearance would be “greatly reduced” after the day Kate and Gerry McCann remember their eldest daughter exactly a decade and a half on from the holiday mystery. It is believed Brueckner, currently behind bars in Germany for the rape of a -year-old tourist, would have to be made an ‘arguido’ in Portugal before May  to facilitate his eventual prosecution on the Algarve. Sources close to the case said last night they viewed it as “highly unlikely.” One well-placed insider said Portuguese police and prosecutors were working on the theory Madeleine’s abductor could still be tried there because she may still be the victim of an ongoing kidnapping. The insider said: “In the event Madeleine is still alive, we could be looking at a crime where the idea of a -year time limit on prosecution can go out of the window because the clock starts ticking the moment the crime stops.” However,the Portuguese authorities eventually decide not to pursue Brueckner, he could still be prosecuted over Maddie by the German authorities in their country where he is currently being held despite an alleged crime being committed in Portugal. Portugal’s Attorney General agreed to reopen the investigation into Madeleine McCann’s disappearance in October , more than five years after it was archived, following a formal request from the Policia Judiciaria. PJ chief Helena Monteiro is still heading an ongoing Portuguese police ‘cold case’ review from the northern city of Porto. In October  she quizzed the widow of a former worker at the tourist complex where Madeleine’s parents were staying when she vanished. Serial thief Euclides Lopes Monteiro, who died in a tractor accident in August , has never been publicly ruled out as a suspect despite calls from his family for police to confirm his innocence. German prosecutors are still hoping to charge Brueckner over Madeleine McCann’s disappearance. Late last year it was reported he would be charged in Germany with three separate sex crimes this year including the rape of an Irish woman in  on the Algarve.

The move comes as warmongering president Vladimir Putin told his enemies that they will face consequencesthey worsen the situation in Ukraine.Claims their fearsome missile system have now been shted amid a further NATO row will do little to ease tensions. Video has today emerged showing two Russian coastal defence missile systems driving ominously towards Finlandaposs capital Helsinki, which sits on a peninsula in the Gulf of the country. Russia has warned both the Finns and Sweden against joining the intergovernmental military alliance, arguing the move would not bring stability to Europe.  Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said her nation is still considering applying to join NATO by the summer following growing support. Putin today insisted that his stalling invasion of Ukraine would still prevail as he chillingly threatened world starvation as a result of Western sanctions against Moscow.The faltering attack, which has seen Russian troops retreat from Ukrainian cities and turn their attention on the Donbas region, is still going to plan, the flagging dictator insisted. Now the missile systems - understood to be the K-P Bastion-P mobile coastal defence system - has been seen on the move.The deadly machine is designed to take out ships and aircrafts, military experts say. US defence officials said Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine has been a massive strategic blunder - and is likely to lead to NATO enlargement. They expect both the Nordic neighbours to bid for membership in the months ahead. Twisted Putin vowed that troops will use weapons of unprecedented characteristics as he refuses to back down and admit his attempts to seize Ukraine are failing.  He was surrounded by security officers as he touched down in the far eastern region of Amur this morning to visit a space port in commemoration of the Sovietaposs first manned space mission. His latest promise comes amid claims that Russian soldiers deployed illegal chemical weapons in the besieged city of Mariupol - where thousands of innocent civilians have been slaughtered.

Putinaposs movements across Russia are now a tightly held secret, and while his arrival was announced early this morning in Blagoveshchensk, close to the Chinese border, his departure and routings were not disclosed. A day earlier he was in Moscow for a frosty meeting with Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer. Solovey - who claims to have high-level Kremlin insider sources - has long alleged Putin suffers from cancer and other medical conditions, a theory for which he has provided no hard evidence. But he was backed up earlier this month by an investigation from independent Project media that showed Putin is followed everywhere by a vast medical team, including oncology specialists. Some of the doctors were named.Putin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu often “vanish to bomb shelters east of the Urals, nuclear bomb shelters,” said Solovey. “Putin spends most of his time there. There are several of them, with the key one where Putin stays - able to fit up to , people.” The facility is intended to house Russian survivors in the event of Armageddon. Separate claims have suggested a location close to a major Gazprom facility in the far north of Russia. Solovey last month suggested Putin hid his family in a hi-tech bunker in the Altai Mountains, but it was not clearhis latest claim relates to the same place.  “The one where [General Valery Gerasimov and Shoigu] stays can fit up to , people. It’s up to one kilometre deep,” he said. Gerasimov is chief of the armed forces general staff and rumours suggest he has gained in influence with Putin over the war, while Shoigu’s sway has waned. On the alleged illnesses, Solovey has claimed Putin is suffering abdominal cancer and early stage Parkinson’s Disease, while Proekt suggested he has thyroid cancer. He told interviewer Vadim Rodionov on Riga-based Russian language YouTube channel ‘I Gryanul Grem’: “Vladimir Putin’s real health issues started between  and , and these really were serious problems - by which I don’t mean issues with thyroid, for example, thyroid cancer.” The presenter asked him: “Speaking more about these problems, how long does Vladimir have  Is it a fatal disease or a chronic disease, or… ”  Solovey, linked to General SVR channel, said: “He has several of them, there is the whole bouquet of them, and one fatal illness. He reiterated his forecast that Putin would be forced to quit politics at some point this year. “I didn’t say he’ll finish his earthly existence, these are dferent things,” he said. “I said he won’t be in politics in [by the end of] , and as far as I know nothing changed in this regard.” Solovey claims Putin has a secret family with former gold-medal winning gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Rumours have iously placed her as hiding in a secluded Swiss chalet or in a Siberian bunker. “I strongly doubt Alina Kabaeva was hiding in Switzerland,” said Solovey in the interview which has been seen more than one million times.  “According to my information she’s been in the Russian Federation, in an absolutely secure location. I have no doubt the Russian president will do everything possible and even impossible to secure his family. “Should they need to be abroad, it definitely won’t be Switzerland.… Right now, they are safe in Russia, as far as I know…” He said there was another friendly country - which he did not name - where Putin might send his family should they be deemed at risk in Russia. In February, Solovey was held for a seven hour interrogation apparently linked to General SVR Telegram channel, which has published multiple allegations about Putin’s supposed medical and mental condition. Solovoy was a professor at Moscow State Institute of International Relations- attended by future top diplomats and spies.

Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right.

There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked. Always climb gates at the hinge end.On reaching large farm sheds take the small bridge over Killean burn and cut through the field to the shore.Your route once more wends its way down the beach, over an igneous dyke and Permian red sandstone, all the way back to A’Chleit.

As the country emerged from its second lockdown, football was one of the few after-school activities available. As a result, many more girls came along to try the sport for the first time with the existing mixed teams at the club.Sensing the enthusiasm, Ally Robb, LVSC chairman and one of the club’s coaches, saw the potential to develop an all-girls team for the first time. With the support of fellow coach Bob Campbell, he ran an initial training session for P-P girls. This was quickly followed by another mini milestone: a first ever LVSC U girls’ game in a friendly against Penicuik in June .“After a great first game, coaches and parents alike were keen to ensure this new chapter in the club’s history was given every opportunity to succeed,” said Ally.In the nine months since the inaugural game, the club has extended training to include girls from P to P. Three new coaches subsequently joined the team and, with the support of parent helpers, they organise weekly training sessions and games.The club and team are now affiliated with the Scottish Women’s Football Association and this year have attended tournaments in Lauder, Galashiels and Coldstream, playing a mix of three, four and seven-a-side games..removeAnd it’s fair to say that the girls are loving the experience. Now aged , Sophie Thomas has played mixed football at the club since she was five but has really enjoyed playing just with girls – particularly when ing around in the mud as a goalkeeper.“We get to play with dferent age groups and we all play well together,” she said. “I think there is more passing in girls’ football.”“It’s a completely dferent atmosphere in the girls’ team, with the older players really helping the younger ones,” added Orla Thomson, aged , and another relative veteran of mixed games. “We all love playing in front of spectators as they shout their support.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots.

Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line.

It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve.

Signs of spring, my favourite season, were visible all over our garden. The blackbird was perched on the fence and I opened the window so I could hear his song better.I watched him for a moment. He is a regular visitor but he seemed particularly vocal this morning. Then I noticed there was a female blackbird as well. I felt privileged that I could witness their visit to our small rewilded garden, which we have tried to make bird friendly.Then the singing stopped and they both seemed to be peering down at the patch of soil where we have recently planted wildflower seeds and vegetables. The male landed on the soil and began hopping in a zig-zag fashion, stopping every now and then. At first I wonderedthis was a dance to impress the female, but soon realised he was looking for breakfast.Blackbirds love earthworms and I supposed the overnight rain on the exposed soil of our newly seeded flowerbed meant it was a good moment to go hunting for his favourite food. He was looking for worms, but also listening for them, as blackbirds can hear the sound of them moving underground. I find that almost dficult to believe, but apparently it’s true. It was fascinating and joyous to watch.But I don’t knowhe caught any worms. My attention was taken by the sound of our kids getting up. School day morning routine beckoned. Time seems to vanish in the drama of it all, and so after I kissed my we goodbye as she headed for work, I quickly got busy making the kids’ breakfast.It was at this moment an emotion overtook me: guilt. I often feel a sense of guilt when I know others are suffering terribly. One solution could be to disconnect from it, not think about it, or even try not to care. After all, we have our own family worries and problems to sort out.But the guilt comes from the empathy I feel and I don’t want to disconnect from that. I don’t think I could stop caring evenI tried. The world needs more empathy, not less. But there is a downside to it: it can become overwhelming and even affect my mental health.Guilt in this context is such a useless emotion. It doesn’t help those who are suffering and it certainly doesn’t help the person feeling empathy. So as my guilt arrived at the breakfast table that morning, I gave it short shrt and became determined to replace it with two things.The first was to learn the lesson the blackbird had taught me moments before, to enjoy the moment and the gts around me. It put me in mind of a beautul short film of the artist David Hockney, made by Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. It’s titled The World is Beautul and he talks about the beauty around us and that when bad news is dominating our senses, the arrival of spring is good news. The important thing is to really notice the gts around us, which Hockney says he does with “intensity”.So I took up his advice and, on my walk to school with my son, I made sure I was fully present for him as he talked about monsters, Dr Who and his favourite scenes from Clash of the Titans. I savoured every moment of our connection and conversations.On myto the house, I made an extra effort to notice the beauty of spring’s arrival and other gts: the diamond-like sparkle of the dew drops on the grass, and the patterns made by the children running and playing amongst them, the dedication of George the lollipop man in keeping us all safe, the brief and faint rainbow in the sky above us, and the shimmer of the sea below the trees in bloom, and the yellow carpet of daffodils dancing in the breeze the birdsong, the smiles and greeting of people, the sense of community, the warmth of the sun the fact of being alive and having loved ones in my le.The walk was only four minutes, but when we notice the beauty and gts we have around us with the intensity that Hockney mentions, then we don’t measure with time.The second thing was to change my guilt into acts of compassion that can make a dference, no matter how small. Donate, write a letter, send a message of support, whatever. That way, empathy works for positive change for those in need.I already knew all this, but it seems I constantly need to relearn it. And that morning, the blackbird helped me to do so. His song was an awakening gt, his zig-zag hop across the soil a reminder that we should have moments when we pause to look and listen with “intensity.”Asto confirm this, he was still there on the fence when I ed home. I’d love to say he had a worm in his beak, as that would have been such a poetic ending, but he didn’t. His companion wasn’t there and he flew off as I watched him.He’d made my morning by making a positive dference in ways he will never know or understand, and not just for me."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-thousands-new-trees-planted-butterdean","story":"At the end of last month, local school groups and corporate volunteers got out their gloves, boots and shovels to help plant new trees.The trust also ran a community day on Saturday, March , that saw  people participate and help populate the wood with thousands of native trees., Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! \" alt\"East Lothian Courier: This is the McCrum family of Tranent.Mum Leigh, Ella , Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! \" class\"editor-image\"The McCrum family of Tranent.  Mum Leigh, Ella , Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! Woodland Trust Scotland recently acquired two open fields adjacent to Butterdean Wood, thanks to support from Bank of Scotland.

Unfortunately, I still have a job to do and won’t be holidaying for a few months, but it doesn’t stop me dreaming of sun and sea. I do love the south of France and hopefully I’ll be heading there soon.But what about my pets  When I’m away for a short spell, I like someone to look after my pets in their own home. They are relaxed in their own environment.However, when on a longer holiday, my pets are looked after extremely well by boarding kennels and cattery in East Lothian. Cats are not usually the best travellers but you can try using calming cat pheromones to relax them. Your vet can advise you on ‘Feliway’ cat calming products for any journey. My dog Lucy, on the other hand, loves travelling and adores going to the boarding kennel. She gets so excited when she knows she is on her way to the kennels.But whatyou want to take your pets with you on holiday  In Britain today, pets can travel by road, rail, sea or air. Each form of travel presents its own unique set of problems.The Highway Code is very specic about animals in cars. They should be under control in vehicles and unable to distract you while you are driving. If you want your dog to be loose in the car, he should be separated from you, and thus an estate vehicle, SUV or hatchback with a strong dog guard is ideal. Alternatively, a crate or cage can be used, the dimensions of which should be comfortable for the animal.Travel, or more correctly motion sickness, affects many dogs. It is due to the effect of the motion on the organs of balance located in the inner ear. Signs are usually excessive salivation, restlessness or excitement. Consult your veterinary surgeon as there are several prescription medicines that are extremely effective for this condition. Excitable dogs can be tranquilised but make sure you do not give too much, which may result in your pet becoming very drowsy, since the dose depends largely on the temperament and amount of excitement.Remember that even the most well-behaved dog can take fright at the sight and noise associated with a railway station and trains. Make sure that the collar and lead are strong and secure.Today, dferent railway companies have ying conditions regarding the transport of pets and therefore you should always enquire prior to your trip. Cats should be transported in secure carriers at all times. When travelling on the underground with your dog, remember it must be carried up and down any escalators. If you have a large dog, seek other means of access to the .Many ships and ferries today have permanent kennels into which your dog must be placed for the duration of the trip. The provision of a familiar blanket or toy helps to ease the tension of the journey for your pet.International Air Transport Associationregulations regarding carrier size apply to all international flights. Remember the container will be your pet’s home for theof the flight and also for an appreciable time prior to and after the flight after you have checked in and until he is collected after the flight. The carrier should be large enough for your dog to stand up and turn around freely. It is useful to use several thicknesses of newspaper, plus an acrylic dog bed of the VetBed type as bedding. A familiar article in the container helps to calm the animal. It is always worthwhile checking with the airline regarding their particular requirements.Not only has Covid- had a marked effect on travel, Brexit certainly has in respect of travelling overseas with your pets. Previously, for travel to EU countries, we vets could issue passports for your pet to travel with you to Europe. This is no longer the case.If you are considering travelling to an EU country with your pet, please start to plan long before your trip. Animals, specically dogs, cats and ferrets, require an Animal Health Certicateto travel to an EU country, including Northern Ireland. Any other pets require an Export Health Certicate or,you are travelling to non-EU countries, you will require a specic certicate issued in combination of DEFRA and the country you are travelling to.If you are travelling to an EU country, your pet needs to be microchipped and registered to you in the UK. This has to be read and confirmed by a vet prior to your pet being vaccinated against rabies.Recently, Mr Andrew Finlayson came to our Tranent surgery with his beautul greyhounds Celt and Lassie for their rabies vaccines. I checked their microchips and their paperwork prior to giving their vaccines. The AHC can only be issued more than three weeks after this rabies vaccination. The vet must be a registered official veterinary surgeonin order to be able to complete the certicate. The certicate cannot be issued until within  days of your travel from the UK date. Your vet needs to check your pet at this time.If you are travelling to Northern Ireland, Eire, Malta, Norway or Finland, your pet needs to be given medication against tapeworms between one and five days of you travelling. At Dunedin Vets, we combine this with the examination for the AHC.Each AHC is unique to your pet or pets. Up to five animals can travel on one certicate. The certicates are only valid for one journey from the UK. You have to state the country where you are entering the EU and there only certain designated ports or airports you can travel to. There is a specic AHC for each EU country and each one issued has its own unique certicate number, for your pet or pets. The AHC is valid for up to four months you mustto the UK before this time is up, but you can travel around EU countries during this time.These AHCs are long documents which have to be completed accurately with all the correct details, which owners have to provide in advance to the veterinary surgeon who completes them.If you are considering taking your pets to the EU this summer, contact your veterinary surgeon as soon as possible to ensure all the required paperwork is in order. We want to avoid disappointments at all costs.If you are wanting to travel further afield, contact DEFRA as soon as you know. A recent Export Health Certicate for dogs travelling to Dubai took almost six months to arrange.Plan in advance and hopefully everyone can have a lovely summer holiday."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-park-new-home-french-sport-petanque","story":"Visitors to Lauderdale Park will be able to try their hand at the sport of petanque.The sport, which involves trying to score points by having boules closer to the target than the opponent, dates back more than  years.Now, after work between ious groups, a petanque piste has been created in the town, similar to that found in Haddington and North Berwick.Stuart McCombie, who has represented Scotland in petanque, is behind the idea to bring the sport to Dunbar.He said: “I used to play petanque many years ago at ious levels with ying degrees of success.“I retired to Dunbar three years ago and there are no petanque facilities within Dunbar.“For the last of couple of years, I have been playing in Haddington.“They have got a beautul piste set up beside the river and the church.“I play there with the UAand it was not until I moved here and joined that I was playing regularly again on a Wednesday.“They also play on a Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday and it is a long-established nice group of folk.“I looked round and North Berwick have got a small piste by the tennis courts but there’s nothing in Dunbar.”Dunbar already has its own French connection, having been twinned with the town of Lignieres for nearly  years.Discussions took place between Mr McCombie, Dunbar and District Twinning Association, Dunbar Community Council and Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership . An appeal was put out on social media to check levels of interest in the facility being created.Mr McCombie told the Courier he was “quite taken aback” by the feedback and decided to move forward with the plans.Funding was sourced from both the community council and DELAP, with work to create the piste in Lauderdale Park well under way.Mr McCombie said: “The building is near completion.“The piste is now almost up and running and I’ve had the first throw, just testing the surface.“It is a fantastic setting, a beautul setting. I did not think for a moment we would get inside the walled garden of Lauderdale Park.”Members of the public will be able to play the sport whenever there is not an organised event being held.Anyone without their own boules can hire them for £ – which covers everyone involved in the game – from the park’s cafe.Disabled access has also been created at the piste, with an official launch expected to coincide with Dunbar Civic Week, which runs from June  to  this year.Pippa Swan, community council chairwoman, was delighted to see the plans moving forward.She said: “Several dferent options were considered and the conclusion was Lauderdale Park was the best.“It is protected, it has a wall, a cafe, when children are playing in the garden the parents can play petanque.“The other big thing is that it is entirely accessible to anybody. Little kids can play, adults can play, disabled people can play and I just thought it was fun.”"},{"url":null,"title":"outlander-heading-east-lothian","story":"John Muir Country Park, near Dunbar, was converted into an -century battle camp on Sunday, with residents spotting rows of identical old-fashioned tents.Other period pieces were also spotted, including horse-drawn carts, cannons, old-fashioned woven bags for sand or grain and other smaller props.The area remains cordoned off to the public, with cast and crew not having arrived on the site as of yet.The period drama has become an international sensation, following the history of Scotland from the Highland clearances to the Jacobite rebellion and beyond.Actor Sam Heughan has been spotted filming already in Fe and Edinburgh, leading many to believe he will soon be visiting East Lothian as well.More details about what historical battle will be filmed in the county remain unknown, but locals will be hoping to get a glimpse of their favourite actors as they eagerly await the next instalment of the series."},{"url":null,"title":"met-office-easter-bank-holiday-scotland-weather-forecast","story":"It’s not all bad news though, the weather is set to clear up towards the weekend and it should certainly start to feel a little warmer than it has of late.While it might not be time to pack away your umbrella just yet, spring-like weather is on the way.If you havent already heard, its warming up in the run up to #Easter, but just how high will #temperatures climb  📈Find out in our updated weather for the week ahead 👇 pic EfHeVdpPIt is a rather wet and chilly start to the week rain is expected across most of Scotland today and tomorrow.

Potato crops damaged by dry weather, spiralling fertiliser costs and shortages of labour are expected to push prices upwards of  per cent this year.Overheads in the form of rates, taxes and minimum wage add a further challenge to profits.Now, due to the drastic and terrible situation in Eastern Europe, sunflower oil is becoming impossible to source and alternative, more expensive oils will need to be sourced.East Lothian rapeseed oil will command a good price and we can also expect to see fields of sunflowers in our county.All this has become a perfect storm for our chippies.

Rail Network to showcase the vital, sometimes le-changing work taking place in community rail.East Lothian Community Rail Partnership is one of Scotland’s eight community rail partnerships, organisations carrying out projects to bring improvements to rail services and stations, such as improved accessibility and community facilities, while helping communities to have a voice in rail and transport development, working with train operators, local authorities, and other partners.They also build local confidence and awareness around train travel, breaking down barriers and creating a sense of public ownership towards the railways.Currently, East Lothian Community Rail Partnership is working on a project to replace the murals at Prestonpans station with new weatherproof murals.It is also intending to introduce handy paper timetables now that these are no longer readily available and place these into numerous local businesses, hotels and guest houses to ensure that information is easily available to all.Jools Townsend, chief executive of Community Rail Network, said: “As Scotland’s railways enter a new era, and with the need to encourage greener ways to get around more pressing than ever, Scotland’s community rail movement is redoubling its efforts.“We see the sht of ScotRail trains into public ownership as a great opportunity to further connect local communities

town which I’d never stopped in before and explored, and whilst I’m very familiar with the beaches and parts of the John Muir Way along the coast, I’d never experienced the Lammermuirs.“Whilst I’d crisscrossed them on the road bike, to head into the surprisingly empty sections of high ground and find the old Herring Road and the old trade routes through East Lothian was fascinating because you can see the history laid bare in the hills around you.”Filmmaker Markus added: “My favourite part of the East Lothian boundary route is the section that crosses the Lammermuir Hills.“Although they are so close to Edinburgh, there are very few people up there, and I fondly remember the hills from my round-the-world trip as well.“After dinner in the chippy in Haddington, I pitched my tent in the Lammermuir Hills on my first night of the round-the-world trip that took me to  dferent countries, and those great memories came back when Mark and I cycled the route in July.”The idea for the

Like … this big.” I pulled a rolling pin out of the cutlery drawer.“Lucky! And was he generous ”This confirms all men’s worst nightmares of how women describe these occasions.The full account of the previous evening’s exertions are outrageously funny and gloriously manky.In all the spilling and leaking and splashing, though, there’s humanity and compassion as one girl struggles through shame and self-doubt to find what everyone is looking for: love and a little tenderness.“I was really touched by the messages I was getting from other women when I first started posting my blogs. They were telling me that they’d been waiting for years for someone to describe how it really is for them in real le.“There was a time when people tended to be judgmental about dating websites, as though it was for desperadoes. But it’s totally mainstream now.”I ask herit’s not fraught with a greater degree of peril for women than it is for men. Are they taking a bigger risk Several of my female friends have relayed tales of meeting blokes who think that the simple act of agreeing to go on a date is a contractual guarantee of sex.“I’ve never agreed to date someone with whom I haven’t had a prolonged period of chatting beforehand. Therefore, you can usually tell who the roasters are. Are they over-affectionate or too complimentary about the way you look “Andyou’re only agreeing to have a coffee then that sets its own boundaries.“When I was younger I was probably quite naive about all of this, but you learn from experience. I think you can get a sense of someone from the way they dress and their chatthey’re bad news.“My friends call this ‘The f***-boy vibes’.”This is one of several revelatory locutions with which Sophie acquaints me during our conversation. I strive to appear knowledgeable and seasoned about all of this and affect an insouciant man-of-the-world vibe that soon crumbles.I’m treated to some other new concepts. One of these is “dropping a pin”.Sophie explains this is a safety mechanism where her friends can electronically embed her location on their smartphones in case anything untoward unfolds.Another one is the “Tinder-walk”. This, Sophie explains, became one of the big features of Scotland in lockdown while people like me were watching old football videos and trying to decipher cookery books.Yet this Tinder-walk malarkey possesses a reassuringly vintage aesthetic. “Everyone got a dog and went on Tinder walks during lockdown,” she says. “It helped to ease us all through the social restrictions and was a way of keeping the flames of romance enkindled.”Heather Suttie, the Scottish events and PR specialist, was thrilled when she first read A Glasgow Kiss. “It just seemed to be what a lot of us had been waiting for,” she said. “I can’t remember laughing so much at a book – and crying too.“It’s just so honest and it could only have been written by a Glaswegian because it’s got that honesty and directness that’s usually missing from fiction that deals with sex and relationships.”Suttie is founder of BookFace, an international, online book club that holds monthly events in Glasgow with modern authors. “When Sophie appeared at one last month the response from women and men was overwhelmingly positive. Yes, some of the scenes are outrageously graphic, but they’re leavened with humour and honesty.”There are several astonishing aspects to A Glasgow Kiss. It’s been written by a first-time author who had not the remotest idea of how to break into the publishing world and yet has secured her a two-book deal featuring the further adventures of Zara.And as well as hitting top spot in the Erotic Fiction charts, Waterstone’s made it one of their books of the year. Yet, she’s still looking for a literary agent.Perhaps the most startling is that Sophie wrote the book while juggling the demands of being a full-time nurse in a busy Glasgow hospital during lockdown with the responsibilities of being a single mother to two children.“I didn’t really stop to think about that,” she said. “Writing the book probably helped me cope during the pandemic.”And while the majority of the responses to the book have been from women, quite a few blokes responded too.“I can honestly say that all the responses from men, including from some former internet dates, have been very positive. They all got the humour.“One messaged me last night and said: ‘F*** me, it was like reading an old scuddy mag when I was a lad. If you ever feel like ditching the halo just give me a shout and I’ll take you out’. I mean, where did he even get his hands on the book ”Any worries she may have harboured about the reactions of friends and family were ill founded.“I’d only initially told a few of them and they were all so supportive. I was a bit more anxious about my family’s reaction, to be honest.“They’re all pretty committed and traditional west of Scotland Catholics, but my mum says she’s very proud of me. She hasn’t read it and I don’t really want her to. But she knows what it’s about. And my family have also said that, of all of them, I was the one with no filters.“I recently bumped into one of my gran’s friends, a woman in her s. She waved over and said: ‘I bought your book. I sat down with it at  o’clock last week and I didn’t stop til am.’ And she’s the holiest wee woman ever. She’s lovely.“And then she said: ‘Your granny would have been so proud of you’. “I was also a bit worried about how it might be received at my workplace. And then I saw that some of my patients were reading it. One of them was sitting in our dialysis unit reading it and asked me to come over and sign it for her.”Recently, on the gogglebox, there have been some howlers posing as provocative television drama that are about as edgy as Classic FM.You find yourself unconsciously casting A Glasgow Kiss even as you’re reading it, as it’s perfect for a six-part comedy drama. The second book in the series will be published in August and by then Sophie hopes to have found an agent.There’s a message from the author at the front of the book. It says simply: “This book is for any girl who has ever wondered why she isn’t enough.“Just open your eyes and raise your standards. I see you.”l A Glasgow Kiss, by Sophie Gravia, is published in paperback by Orion Books, £..It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

For working we listen to jazz and soundtracks – mostly instrumental stuff. Sun Ra has a special place: even his le story is fascinating. Running the Arkestra meant providing structure for lots of musicians, keeping them healthy too. His DIY approach is interesting, like an early punk, only jazz. Chet Baker is another artist that we always go back to. His music has such a beautul feel to it, and the phrasing is incredible, whether on trumpet or voice. A real emotional depth.We grew up in dferent countries and dferent decades but found we had listened to a lot of the same records. For example, we love Moondog and also Morricone, and recently we’ve been tuning in to Harold Budd. But sometimes at the end of the day we’ll blast something to change our headspace. The Homosexuals made records that are really great – innovative and timeless. In fact, the late s and early s were very fertile periods. Sandra took the time to make a pastel drawing of Mark E. Smith, to celebrate his le and the music of The Fall.CINEMAIt probably isn’t too surprising, given that we make comics and that’s visual storytelling, but we watch a lot of films. Hitchcock is a favourite – we can re-watch his films repeatedly and always find something new to appreciate. Bergman is incredible, and his work isn’t always necessarily bleak. Fanny and Alexander is a masterpiece weto annually. It has a great atmosphere. Last year we watched a bunch of oneiric films, like Jan Nemec’s debut, Diamonds of the Night or The Hourglass Sanitorium, directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has, because we are interested in pure cinema and these films are unusually structured too. Some of them are downright trippy and strange like The Saragossa Manuscript.BOOKSSandra Marrs and John Chalmers, aka Metaphrog The Manuscript Found in Saragossa is an amazing piece of literature. Seems very modern still. We read a lot, particularly recently with the pandemic and lockdowns – it’s calming and almost like an antidote to all the flashing screens of modern le. Deep in a Dream: The Long Night of Chet Baker by James Gavin is a great read, almost supernatural in its power. While Straight Le by Art and Laurie Pepper is remarkable too: the writing has an incredible tone and almost painful honesty. It really is brilliant: up there with James Baldwin. We love his books, particularly Another Country. Both of us re-read The Secret History by Donna Tartt last month because we like the book so much. Vladimir Nabokov is a favourite – not only because of the way he interrogates the form of the novel but also because he writes so beautully. He also composed poetry and chess problems, and we hid a couple of those in our Louis books.COMICSIn the world of comics and graphic novels we both love Love and Rockets by the Hernandez brothers: Gilbert, Jaime, and Mario. And, we love Daniel Clowes, Jacques Tardi, Ben Katchor, Charles Burns and also Chris Ware.One thing we really missed in the last two years was access to art galleries and museums – it’s great to be able to visit those again. Frida Kahlo is a favourite and Sandra enjoyed doing a pastel portrait of her last year.The Graphic Novel World of Metaphrog at the Park Gallery in Callendar House, Falkirk closes on SundayIt should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

I think it’s very, very bad timing.”Askedhe was frustrated with the VAR decision to rule out Alonso’s goal for handball, Tuchel continued: “Not only today, it is like this for some time, and now maybe I get problems.“If you play against Real Madrid you can maybe not expect everybody has the courage. I felt little decisions went against us also in the first-leg and today as well.“I did not see the goal but I told him I’m super disappointed he didn’t go to check it himself.“You should stay the boss and not give decisions like this to somebody in a chair and isolated from the atmosphere .“A referee has a certain style, things he allows and doesn’t allow, so I think he should stay in charge and check it on his own, then he could explain it better.“But this is just my opinion.

Luck was not on our side and you always need luck.”Real boss Ancelotti praised his players for finding a route to victory from an at-best patchy performance.“At points I think we weren’t quite hungry enough but our performance especially in the first-half was good,” said Ancelotti.“And then after the second goal we did start to struggle because my team experienced a bit of a psychological down.“But this stadium is truly magical and our fans really help our players, the whole team to never give up.“I’m very, very happy to have made the semi-finals thanks to this team, a team that’s capable of suffering.“But the more we suffer on the pitch the happier I am afterwards.“I think Cha used up a lot of their stamina and that gave us an edge in extra-time because my players weren’t as fatigued as our opponents.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-295-april-10-wordle-word-hints-todays-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values. They are that memorable phrase we hear our elders say once they have explained its meaning to us, we are unlikely to forget it.Theyto us often and roll off the tongue.One of the most important collections of Gaelic proverbs was published in  by Alexander Nicolson .However, Nicolson was merely re-printing a collection made by Donald Macintosh, a Perthshire-born clergyman, first printed in Edinburgh in .

The strength of attachment to people and place shines through both.Blood is stronger than breeding., ‘blood is thicker than water’, and perhaps it should come as no surprise to us that a society which places strong emphasis on ancestry and blood ties should have so many proverbs reinforcing such beliefs..Sad is the inheritance of a bad disease.This proverb is the perfect reminder that not everything we inherit from our ancestors is good.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4576366.jpg--.jpg?1649424170000\n","title":"daria through to miss ni final","story":"A former pupil of Patricks College in Ballymena has made it through to the final of the Miss Northern Ireland competition.Daria Gapska, a -year-old childrens nursing student, recently ed to the college for a presentation to Year  on her chosen charity Braveheartsni.Daria was one of two finalists to be crowned at the first live Miss World Northern Ireland Heat of  in Nu Delhi, Belfast in front of an an astute judging  which included Managing Director of ACA models and Event organiser Victoria Withers.

Start by thinking how much water you are using each day. Whether you are washing your hands, cleaning endless amounts of dishes or getting through that mountain of washing, you start to realise just how important water is and the sheer amount we use. NI Water’s Environmental Outreach  Learning Officer, Anna Killen, explains how we can save water by looking at everyday habits, “It’s amazing to think that each day each person uses around  litres of water! However, saving water can be really easy, there are simple things we can all do that can make a huge dference. “Did you know that the average time people in Northern Ireland spend in the shower is  minutes, over % of people still overfill the kettle and less than frac of people have a waterbutt ”  “We want that to change and it’s easy, start by looking at small changes for example, your kettle, since working from home it has have been working overtime, but just fill with as much water as you need. Overfilling can use twice as much energy and water, each time you boil. “With rising energy costs, it might be time to think about reducing the time spent in the shower, hot water costs money!

Some water saving tips:  Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth - A running tap can use  litres ofwater per minute.  Use a bowl for washing vegetables - Then you can reuse this water for plants.  Make full use of your washing machine - Half load programmes on washing machines use more than half the water and energy of a full load, so wait until the machine is full before switching it on.  Fix leaking taps - A dripping tap can waste more than  litres of water per week.  Keep a jug of water in the fridge, instead of letting the tap run cold.

Amenities are to include private balconies, shared courtyards and shared roof terraces. Some  units are to be social housing.Lacuna Developments, Titanic Quarter Ltd and Belfast Harbour have teamed up with Welsh firm Watkin Jones Group for the development, which will be called ‘Loft Lines’.It will be a mix of private rented and social apartments, alongside recreational spaces, gyms and children’s play area. Loft Lines will also include a public area with a sports park for outdoor events and exercise classes called South Yard Square, while there will also be space for a coffee shop, restaurant and creche.According to planning documents submitted on behalf of the applicants: “The proposals describe a new, contemporary and sustainable residential development that is rooted in the qualities and history of the place and declares its future as an iconic waterfront neighbourhood. We want to express the three blocks as a cluster of urban objects around a new square.

Blocks  and a are proposed for Build to Rentblocks whilst Block  is proposed for social housingwith the remainder being managed by the Housing Association for private rental. An area of the sitewould be dedicated as a public square ,” the briefing paper reads.“It is further estimated that non-residential uses at the proposed development will require a total of  gross direct FTEjobs on-site to support commercial community operations in the retail, professional services, health and care and hospitality sectors. The application is accompanied by an Environmental Assessment which concludes that subject to appropriate mitigation, the negative impactswhich could arise from the developments are either negligible or are not signicant.”To date, the planning application has attracted six letters of support and nine objections.

The seat, which they lost in , is being actively targeted in next month’s poll.Their candidate there, Paul Doherty, is a Turf Lodge native who runs the local food bank. The SDLP are hoping that, during a cost-of-living crisis, he will be the man to snatch back those lost votes.Party leader Colum Eastwood pointed to the toxicity that has marred the first few weeks of the election campaign.Mr Doherty was threatened while putting up posters in the Shankill, but Mr Eastwood said his party were putting the “cost-of-living crisis” front and centre.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSDLP party leader Colum Eastwood, West Belfast candidate Paul Doherty, former SDLP politician Dr Joe Hendron, North Belfast candidate Nichola Mallon and South Belfast MP Claire Hanna FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSDLP party leader Colum Eastwood, West Belfast candidate Paul Doherty, former SDLP politician Dr Joe Hendron, North Belfast candidate Nichola Mallon and South Belfast MP Claire Hanna“People don’t have the time to worry about all the shenanigans at Stormont, about who is going to be first or deputy first minister. The vast majority of people are really struggling and really annoyed that politicians were willing to walk away when they can’t heat their homes or fill up their car,” he said.“We have the best possible candidate: Paul Doherty is feeding  families a week he is a genuine community activist.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Dr Joe Hendron, the former MP for west Belfast, showed up at the launch in the Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich, the Irish language cultural hub on the Falls Road, on Monday morning to offer support for the launch.At  years of age, he is SDLP royalty, a veteran of the party who knows what it’s like to battle Sinn Féin at the polls.The Belfast West MP between  and , he lost his Westminster seat to Gerry Adams and it has stayed in Sinn Féin’s hands ever since.When a tearful Alex Attwood declared he had “let his party down” when he lost his Assembly seat in , he would have been aware that once the party relinquish a seat in west Belfast, the chances of taking it back are remote.Mr Attwood’s loss was a direct result of the number of MLAs being cut from  to .With four Sinn Féin MLAs and one People Before Profit ed in , the SDLP know they can’t take out Mr Carroll, who has a safe personal vote.Instead, they will be targeting that fourth Sinn Féin seat, potentially at the expense of newcomer Aisling Reilly.An upbeat Mr Eastwood, while not stating numbers, pointed not just to nationalist west Belfast as a possible gain, but Strangford, where the transfer-friendly Conor Houston is a first-time candidate.He also called for tactical voting, saying borrowed votes in Upper Bann could help Dolores Kelly take out DUP veteran and former minister Diane Dodds.The party will also be battling to keep their seat in Lagan Valley, where Pat Catney is under severe pressure from the DUP.“I don’t think they can take him out,” said Eastwood of Catney, a former pub landlord who is one of the party’s more colourful characters.“In Derry we are in the hunt for a third seat. Places like South Antrim, Fermanagh and South Tyrone, these are places where people need to think about tactics,” added Mr Eastwood.“In Upper Bann, for example, Dolores Kelly is [battling] with Diane Dodds for the last seat. If a few people lent us their vote I think we could take Diane Dodds out.“This is not about who the first minister is, as I think that’s already been decided, it is about how many DUP are left in the Executive — and we’d prefer there were fewer.”The loyalist anti-protocol rallies have so far dominated the discourse around the election.There was a round of applause from the party faithful when the Foyle MP said that those who placed a poster with a noose around the neck of the UUP leader in Lurgan at the weekend “couldn’t lace Doug Beattie’s boots”.“This campaign has got off to a fairly bad start. The tone hasn’t been good, our posters have been burned, our canvassers have been threatened, Paul [Doherty] was himself threatened on the Shankill Road and was back the next day handing out food parcels,” added Mr Eastwood.“I am convinced that those determined to drag this place back will fail.“I would say to ordinary unionist people: I don’t think the DUP, for example, will have your best interests at heart. They are the people who delivered Brexit, they delivered the protocol, they trusted Boris Johnson.“People are entitled to protest, %, but with every right comes responsibility and they have to be responsible for the impact. And we’ve seen Doug Beattie being threatened, our people have been threatened — I’m not sure how that’s going to deliver and [effect] change to the protocol.”Related topicsSDLPColum EastwoodSinn FéinPat CatneyDemocratic Unionist PartyDolores KellyBoris JohnsonDoug BeattieMore On SDLPAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From mysterious rally organisers and a problem in East Antrim to an SDLP sing-song PremiumViewpointOpinionDivisions still exist within unionismUnionists snub group which aims to improve cross-community relationsNorthern Ireland Assembly election: Who will top the poll in your constituency and whose seat is at risk How Northern Ireland’s electoral system will prevent any landslide victoriesMost ReadFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidateShauna McDevitt: Friends and colleagues pay tribute to ‘wonderful mammy’ who died in road crashNew £m apartment complex in Belfast awaits approval from councilMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateTop VideosPlaySDLP Assembly candidate assaulted after youths remove posters in South BelfastPlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayBehind-the-scenes as Curry#s fun park opens in Portrush Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Condemnation after SDLP candidate describes attack in south Belfast‘I wasn’t scared, just angry’...

I would never have done this,” he said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I and Jim — and we all — owe loyalty to our party and it’s a pity that Jim, who has made a valuable contribution to unionism over the years, has taken this decision.“He owes it to the party, which has allowed him to gain positions he would not otherwise have gained. But rather than what he owes the party, what does he owe to the country ”Mr Poots, who served as agriculture, environment and rural affairs minister in the last mandate, said: “I have little doubt that Diane Forsythe will still win the seat.“But I think Harold McKee will inflict some serious damage on our vote. He is a decent man and a good candidate.”Now standing in South Belfast following the death of Christopher Stalford, Mr Poots also paid tribute to the service given by Mr Wells over nearly five decades.And as speculation mounted that Mr Wells will, as this newspaper also disclosed, join Jim Allister’s party, perhaps even sooner than expected, Mr Poots said he believed Mr Allister would be happy to see Mr Wells join the TUV ranks.“I am sad to see Jim go after  years of dedicated and faithful service to the party and I wish him and his family well for the future,” Mr Poots added.“He has been a close and valued colleague for many years. But the focus now must be on the election. It is crucial that the DUP wins as many seats as possible.”Mr Poots, who had himself been linked to the South Down seat before party officers finally selected mother-of-three Mrs Forsythe over Mr Wells, refused to criticise Mr Wells for backing Mr McKee, who is himself a former Ulster Unionist who only joined the TUV last November.Another outgoing DUP MLA, however, one of five who privately backed Mr Wells after he lost the party whip four years ago, said he was “shocked” that Mr Wells had backed another party.The DUP member, who does not want to be named, told Mr Wells he had gone too far by endorsing Mr McKee.Mr Wells contacted his party leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, and DUP chief executive Timothy Johnston when he decided he would resign, rather than waiting to be expelled.He refused to talk about the detail of his conversations but said he was giving “extremely sympathetic consideration” to signing up to join Mr Allister’s party.Referring to his resignation, Mr Wells said: “I think the moment I said that I would not be backing the candidate that was imposed upon us, it was inevitable.“I took the decision to contact the party leader and the chief executive and let them know that, after  years, I have gone as a DUP member.”The DUP argued the election should be about more than “mere personalities”, after Mr Wells, who was the sole DUP representative in the constituency since , called on voters to give Mr McKee their first preference ahead of Mrs Forsythe.She has not replied to requests for comment.Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartyTraditional Unionist VoiceJim WellsMore On Democratic Unionist PartyAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From a stressed Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and a missing lamp post, to ironic tweets PremiumDUP MP Jim Shannon withdraws ‘reference’ provided to Conservative MP convicted of child sex offenceFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidate PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionPastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI ProtocolMost ReadFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidateShauna McDevitt: Friends and colleagues pay tribute to ‘wonderful mammy’ who died in road crashNew £m apartment complex in Belfast awaits approval from councilMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateTop VideosPlaySDLP Assembly candidate assaulted after youths remove posters in South BelfastPlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayBehind-the-scenes as Curry#s fun park opens in Portrush Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Condemnation after SDLP candidate describes attack in south Belfast‘I wasn’t scared, just angry’...

Just as he could never accept the fact that I was party leader as a WOMAN and he continuously agitated against me. Jim is still living in the s - sad but there it is. Mrs Foster said voters in South Down have a choice to select principled, able, active representation in Diane Forsythe. [Mr Wells] thought he could impose his will on the voters of South Down asthe seat was his and not theirs, she said.In response, Jim Wells said he would need “a stf drink” before reading Arlene’s opinion of him. “[Her] opinion of me is based on the fact that I was a strong supporter of the campaign to have her removed as party leader in May ,” he said. “I have not regretted that decision for a second.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Earlier on Tuesday Mr Wells, while speaking to the BBC’s Nolan radio programme, said: “I have now resigned from the party after  years. I have decided I cannot support the candidate that the party Executive have imposed upon the people of South Down.”Mr Wells admitted he walked before he was pushed after late on Monday night, he made the decision to contact senior members of the DUP to resign.I feel very strongly about this and I feel that Harold McKee is the best candidate to represent the unionist community of South Down,” he said.Read MoreFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidateMalachi O#Doherty:OpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionPastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI ProtocolThe move could pave the way for the former Health Minister to eventually join Jim Allister’s party.“Harold McKee is the standout candidate and I urge those who supported me in the past to give him their number one preference,” he said.“As I leave the Assembly it is my earnest desire that South Down should continue to have a unionist MLA whose politics are grounded in conviction and principle.“Among the candidates, Harold McKee is the standout candidate with these credentials.“He holds dear many of the core principles that I upheld in Stormont and is widely and properly respected as a politician of conviction rather than expediency.“Accordingly, I recommend him to those who faithfully supported me at the polls over the years and urge them to vote McKee .”A DUP spokesman said, however: “In our opinion only the main unionist party can win this seat and it is absolutely essential that we maximise the number of seats we have in the next Assembly.“Every seat counts. Make no mistake. If on the Saturday morning after the election, Sinn Fein is the largest party there will be no more talk of the health service or rising costs, the focus will be on getting a Border Poll.“Therefore nothing should be done which would split the unionist vote. Although we don’t believe unionism has anything to fear from a Border Poll, it would be destabilising and a distraction from the important business we need to get on with.”They added: “This election is much more important than mere personalities. The seat totals after the count will decide whether Northern Ireland goes in the right or wrong direction and our priorities for the next five years.“Diane Forsythe secured the DUP’s best ever result in South Down in . She is a young mother, rooted in the Mournes with a plan for South Down. Diane will focus on what matters to people.”Mr Wells, meanwhile, arranged a photo-call with Mr McKee and the TUV leader on Monday. Former Ulster Unionist Mr McKee said he was delighted and honoured to have Mr Wells’ support.“In the end he was abandoned by his own party but it is the mark of the man that he wishes the best for South Down going forward,” added Mr McKee who quit the UUP for the TUV last October over the more liberal approach of Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie and his party’s stance on abortion, same-sex marriage and support for a ban on gay conversion therapy.He added: “I am delighted to have Jim’s support and gratied that a broad swathe of unionism is uniting behind me as the standard bearer of principled unionism.” TUV leader Mr Allister also joined in welcoming Jim Wells’ support but there was no comment on the prospect of him joining Mr McKee in the TUV ranks.“At critical times in Stormont Jim Wells was often the only MLA prepared to join me in doing what was right,” Mr Allister said.“In December  we were the only MLAs to speak and vote against  EU regulations essential to bedding in the iniquitous Protocol.“Putting party advantage before principle would have been easy, but Jim did the right thing and likewise today in backing Harold he is putting principle before party.”Mr Allister insisted the Wells backing would bolster the chances of Mr McKee in the tightly-fought constituency where unionist isions could hand the last of the five seats to Alliance or the SDLP.“In strengthening Harold McKee’s hand he is laying the foundation for the continuance in Stormont of South Down representation based on conviction politics. We’ve seen enough of synthetic unionism it’s good to offer the real thing with Jim Wells’ backing,” Mr Allister added.Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartyJim WellsTraditional Unionist VoiceSir Jeffrey DonaldsonEdwin PootsSinn FéinJim AllisterMore On Democratic Unionist Party PremiumFormer DUP colleagues blast Jim Wells’ decision to back TUV candidate in South DownAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From a stressed Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and a missing lamp post, to ironic tweets PremiumDUP MP Jim Shannon withdraws ‘reference’ provided to Conservative MP convicted of child sex offence PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionPastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI ProtocolMost ReadFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidateShauna McDevitt: Friends and colleagues pay tribute to ‘wonderful mammy’ who died in road crashNew £m apartment complex in Belfast awaits approval from councilMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateTop VideosPlaySDLP Assembly candidate assaulted after youths remove posters in South BelfastPlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayBehind-the-scenes as Curry#s fun park opens in Portrush Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Condemnation after SDLP candidate describes attack in south Belfast‘I wasn’t scared, just angry’...

Make no mistake. If on the Saturday morning after the election, Sinn Fein is the largest party there will be no more talk of the health service or rising costs, the focus will be on getting a Border Poll.“Therefore nothing should be done which would split the unionist vote. Although we don’t believe unionism has anything to fear from a Border Poll, it would be destabilising and a distraction from the important business we need to get on with.”They added: “This election is much more important than mere personalities. The seat totals after the count will decide whether Northern Ireland goes in the right or wrong direction and our priorities for the next five years.“Diane Forsythe secured the DUP’s best ever result in South Down in . She is a young mother, rooted in the Mournes with a plan for South Down. Diane will focus on what matters to people.”There was no confirmation or comment on what would happen to Mr Wells in party terms.Mr Wells, meanwhile, arranged a photo-call with Mr McKee and the TUV leader on Monday and accepted his decision would likely result in his expulsion from the party which he joined in the s.Former Ulster Unionist Mr McKee said he was delighted and honoured to have Mr Wells’ support.“In the end he was abandoned by his own party but it is the mark of the man that he wishes the best for South Down going forward,” added Mr McKee who quit the UUP for the TUV last October over the more liberal approach of Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie and his party’s stance on abortion, same-sex marriage and support for a ban on gay conversion therapy.He added: “I am delighted to have Jim’s support and gratied that a broad swathe of unionism is uniting behind me as the standard bearer of principled unionism.” TUV leader Mr Allister also joined in welcoming Jim Wells’ support but there was no comment on the prospect of him joining Mr McKee in the TUV ranks.“At critical times in Stormont Jim Wells was often the only MLA prepared to join me in doing what was right,” Mr Allister said.“In December  we were the only MLAs to speak and vote against  EU regulations essential to bedding in the iniquitous Protocol.“Putting party advantage before principle would have been easy, but Jim did the right thing and likewise today in backing Harold he is putting principle before party.”Mr Allister insisted the Wells backing would bolster the chances of Mr McKee in the tightly-fought constituency where unionist isions could hand the last of the five seats to Alliance or the SDLP.“In strengthening Harold McKee’s hand he is laying the foundation for the continuance in Stormont of South Down representation based on conviction politics. We’ve seen enough of synthetic unionism it’s good to offer the real thing with Jim Wells’ backing,” Mr Allister added.Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartyJim WellsTraditional Unionist VoiceSir Jeffrey DonaldsonEdwin PootsSinn FéinJim AllisterMore On Democratic Unionist Party PremiumFormer DUP colleagues blast Jim Wells’ decision to back TUV candidate in South DownAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From a stressed Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and a missing lamp post, to ironic tweets PremiumDUP MP Jim Shannon withdraws ‘reference’ provided to Conservative MP convicted of child sex offenceFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidate PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionMost ReadFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidateShauna McDevitt: Friends and colleagues pay tribute to ‘wonderful mammy’ who died in road crashNew £m apartment complex in Belfast awaits approval from councilMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateTop VideosPlaySDLP Assembly candidate assaulted after youths remove posters in South BelfastPlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayBehind-the-scenes as Curry#s fun park opens in Portrush Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Condemnation after SDLP candidate describes attack in south Belfast‘I wasn’t scared, just angry’...

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence.

ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility.

Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,. A good job well done.With the racing season in full flow, EDAC club members were quick to get signed up on the recent membership night so that they can keep training and also avail of the club discount when entering races.They might also have been encouraged by the raffle which was held at the sign-up. Congratulations to the lucky winners who snagged bottles of wine and Easter eggs.Patrick Smith even won a free entry to Comber K.

The popularity of cars is such that  years ago railway seemed to have an uncertain future, but train travel has since enjoyed a renaissance in Northern Ireland, as people increasingly enjoy being free of the hassle of driving.It might be that the joy of cruising along picturesque Belfast Lough will be a further lure away from the car to some commuters.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCha boss Tuchel even admitted he could expect repercussions for criticising Polish referee Szymon Marciniak in the wake of the Blues’ - Champions League quarter-final exit.Cha toppled Madrid - at the Bernabeu Stadium in their last-eight second-leg but exited the tournament on aggregate and only after extra time in Madrid.It hurts, but well be back stronger. 💛 pic ldWFlylTds— Cha FCApril , Karim Benzema’s late header ultimately killed off Cha’s hopes of a miracle comeback but German coach Tuchel was left to bemoan Marcos Alonso’s disallowed goal and a clutch of other frustrating issues.Tuchel also criticised referee Marciniak for “laughing and smiling” with Real boss Carlo Ancelotti at full-time.“I’m disappointed that the referee had a good time with my colleague, Carlo Ancelotti,” said Tuchel.“I know Carlo is a gentleman and a nice guy but when I wanted to go and say thank you I see him smiling and laughing loudly with the opponent coach.“I think this is the very, very worst time to do this, after  minutes with one team giving their heart and desire, fighting to the very last drop.“Afterwards you go as a coach and see the referee laughing and smiling with the other coach. I think it’s very, very bad timing.”Askedhe was frustrated with the VAR decision to rule out Alonso’s goal for handball, Tuchel continued: “Not only today, it is like this for some time, and now maybe I get problems.“If you play against Real Madrid you can maybe not expect everybody has the courage. I felt little decisions went against us also in the first-leg and today as well.“I did not see the goal but I told him I’m super disappointed he didn’t go to check it himself.“You should stay the boss and not give decisions like this to somebody in a chair and isolated from the atmosphere ..remove“A referee has a certain style, things he allows and doesn’t allow, so I think he should stay in charge and check it on his own, then he could explain it better.“But this is just my opinion. Maybe it’s too much to ask for in matches like this against this opponent. vw,vw,px, px\"Szymon Marciniak, centre, was criticised by Thomas Tuchel “We had it in our hands and we were not lucky enough, it’s like this.”Tuchel had all-but admitted defeat after Cha lost the first leg - at Stamford Bridge last week.But they stormed into a - lead thanks to goals from Mason Mount, Toni Rudiger and Timo Werner.Rodrygo buried a fine volley after an even better raking pass from Luka Modric to drag Real back from the brink, however, before Benzema thumped in another powerful header to send Madrid through.“We are very disappointed and very proud at the same time,” said Tuchel.“We played a fantastic match, we deserved what we had, four goals and we had big chances to score even more.BOSS pic oZeLxrtvL— Real Madrid C.F. 🇬🇧🇺🇸April , “We were unlucky and that’s why we’re disappointed.“We were beaten by pure inidual quality and two mistakes after ball wins, which are the most crucial moments against Real Madrid.“In the end we were unlucky, we deserved to go through after this performance today but it was not meant to be. Luck was not on our side and you always need luck.”Real boss Ancelotti praised his players for finding a route to victory from an at-best patchy performance.“At points I think we weren’t quite hungry enough but our performance especially in the first-half was good,” said Ancelotti.“And then after the second goal we did start to struggle because my team experienced a bit of a psychological down.“But this stadium is truly magical and our fans really help our players, the whole team to never give up.“I’m very, very happy to have made the semi-finals thanks to this team, a team that’s capable of suffering.“But the more we suffer on the pitch the happier I am afterwards.“I think Cha used up a lot of their stamina and that gave us an edge in extra-time because my players weren’t as fatigued as our opponents.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Thomas Tuchel upset with officials as Cha exit Champions League article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"wit wisdom this too shall pass ","story":"Comedy, about members of Tandragee Golf Club in Co Armagh, played out in men’s locker room   Lurgan stabbings: man arrested on two counts of attempted murderNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsAdam Harbinson. WIT  WISDOM: This too shall passWith our recent fine weather I’ve been doing more than my usual five-to- miles a day walking, an activity that, with many of my countrymen, I developed during the lockdown, when there was little  to do, writes Adam Harbinson.By The NewsroomSunday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Last week was idyllic as I walked along the Donegal coast from Moville to Greencastle it was magical, and it struck me again, that while we all know the value of regular exercise, fresh air and social engagement, we might never really know just how beneficial such days are for our physical and mental health.But what perhaps, on the flipside, will our memories of - be in  years time  We’ll be asking ourselves, how on Earth did we remain sane  Brexit has wreaked havoc on our economy, piled on top of which was Covid-. I can still feel the cloud of gloom that settled on me when a radio announcer was suggesting that all over s would not be allowed outside the door of their homes for  weeks.Thankfully it didn’t quite come to that.Then came the murderous war in Ukraine, with pictures being flashed onto our screens of European families hiding in cellars in fear or their lives, not to mention the bloody carnage. But how does this bad news affect our mental health To further exacerbate my potential for anxiety I can tell you that five of my close friends and family members are suffering from le-threatening health problems one has even invited me to his rd birthday party, when he and I know full well that in reality it’s a ‘going away’ party. I’m in my mid-s and while I feel as mentally and physically fit as I was in my s, the thing I hate about my age is that so many of my contemporaries are dropping like flies.So, what can we do to protect ourselves  Firstly we must regulate our intake of deadly news regular exercise and getting out into the countryside is helpful too. Gratitude is of vital importance, so let’s get a pen and paper and make a list of the many aspects of our lives for which we can be truly grateful.But is that enough  You might say no, but since there might be little we can do to help our suffering brothers and sisters, we must recognise the need for serenity to accept the things we cannot change and thecourage to change the things we can.One thing’s for sure this too will pass.

However, saving water can be really easy, there are simple things we can all do that can make a huge dference. “Did you know that the average time people in Northern Ireland spend in the shower is  minutes, over % of people still overfill the kettle and less than frac of people have a waterbutt ”  “We want that to change and it’s easy, start by looking at small changes for example, your kettle, since working from home it has have been working overtime, but just fill with as much water as you need. Overfilling can use twice as much energy and water, each time you boil. “With rising energy costs, it might be time to think about reducing the time spent in the shower, hot water costs money! Why not try the  minute shower challenge, put on your favourite  minute song and seeyou can finish before the end.” To help you embed with these new habits and ‘Get Water Fit’, complete our online water audit at https:www.getwaterfit or take part in water saving challenges and receive your free water saving items including  minute shower timer, toothy timers and swell gel bags for the garden. Some water saving tips:  Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth - A running tap can use  litres ofwater per minute.  Use a bowl for washing vegetables - Then you can reuse this water for plants.  Make full use of your washing machine - Half load programmes on washing machines use more than half the water and energy of a full load, so wait until the machine is full before switching it on.  Fix leaking taps - A dripping tap can waste more than  litres of water per week.  Keep a jug of water in the fridge, instead of letting the tap run cold.
