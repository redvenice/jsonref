Photograph: iStockA language teacher has admitted to fraudulently creating documents about his qualifications with the aim of securing a second level teaching post in Ireland. A fitness to teach inquiry on Friday heard that the teacher, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left his trainee teaching post in the UK prior to completing an induction period needed to become fully qualified.After returning to Ireland in early 2020, he received an offer of a teaching post in a secondary school the following September on condition that he became registered with the Teaching Council. However, he said he was told by the council that he needed to complete his induction period in order to be registered.The teacher admitted to providing a fraudulent certificate from the UK’s Teaching Regulation Agency indicating that he had completed his induction. The correspondence included a section which was supposed to be filled out by the principal of his former school, and included a stamp purporting to be from the school. The teacher admitted to filling this out himself and falsifying the document.‘Scam’When the teacher’s qualifications were later queried, the inquiry heard, he attempted to cover-up his actions by falsely claiming that he had fallen foul of a “scam” and had been defrauded by an official of the agency.Shortly afterwards, he made a complaint to the Ombudsman, claiming that his application to be placed on the Teaching Council register amounted to “clumsy discrimination”, and repeated the claim he had been scammed.However, the teacher, who was present for the inquiry hearing on Friday, later admitted to the Teaching Council that he had falsified details of his qualifications and was “deeply ashamed” of his actions.“I am truly sorry for all the harm caused by my actions,” he said. “I cannot express enough how deeply ashamed I am of my actions, which are deeply out of character for me.”The teacher told the inquiry he suffered from anxiety and depression and had felt under acute pressure to support his family in Ireland.He said he became increasingly anxious and stressed when he realised he could miss out on a secure teaching post due to his qualifications, and that his anti-depressant medication hampered his ability to think clearly.“Falsifying the documents was a stupid and dishonest move.., I am deeply ashamed of my actions…It was at a low point in my life. I made one mistake, and I will never make it again,” he said.DedicationSeveral character references were produced from schools where he previously worked. They praised his dedication and care towards students.However, the principal of the UK school where the teacher did not complete his induction said he had some concerns over his classroom management.The teacher went on to complete his induction at an Irish school under a rule introduced during the Covid-19 crisis aimed at recognising the qualifications of teachers who qualified abroad.Hugh McDowell BL, who appeared for the director of the Teaching Council, told the inquiry that the teacher’s actions amounted to professional misconduct and were a breach of the teachers’ code of conduct.He said the teacher had “failed to uphold the standards of the profession” and that his conduct was “fundamentally lacking in integrity, honesty and values which the Teaching Council seeks to promulgate among its members.”The Teaching Council’s three-person disciplinary committee inquiry panel - chaired by Charlie Dolan and teachers Kathleen Burke and Noel Cronin - adjourned on Friday evening to continue its deliberations. It is anticipated that it will issue a report by April 13th.Where a finding are made against a registered teacher, the Teaching Council’s disciplinary committee panel may apply no sanction, admonish or censure the teacher, or apply conditions to the teacher’s registration. It may also suspend or remove the teacher from the register."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Western seaboard housed ancient breeds adapted to the leanest of dietsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"residents derailed by work on charlemont metrolink terminus","story":"Local resident Ciaran Black on Dartmouth Road with the Luas bridge in the background. Photograph: Nick BradshawOn a freezing March morning, Ciaran Black stands on the southbound Luas bridge platform at Charlemont, pointing at a sprawling concrete building site below, ground zero for local hostility.The cause of tensions is not the visible redevelopment of the former Irish Nationwide Building Society on Grand Parade. It is what lies beneath that is causing a widening fissure between community and planners.Underneath the building site, preliminary foundation works have been carried out for the construction of a Link interchange or terminus, even though planning permission has yet to be sought.For residents, it is an utterly inappropriate location for an underground station potentially ferrying Dublin’s southside community to and from the city’s airport.Those who live here, particularly around Dartmouth Square – an affluent Victorian rectangle of three-storey redbrick homes – are incensed at what might be coming.With time running out, Black is to the forefront of efforts to force an 11th-hour rethink. Residents have the backing of councillors who have sought a study on potential alternatives sites, with St Stephen’s Green the most prominent option.The NTA has said it will seek planning permission this year for the Link to run from Swords to Charlemont and a business case is due soon. Last November, the authority said any further southside rail connection would not be built until after 2042.Black and his family live on Dartmouth Road, right beside the Luas green line. If the terminus goes ahead, they could be staring at building hoardings outside their front gate for years.But casting off suggestions of “nimbyism”, he cites several reasons residents believe the area is unsuitable for such a rail hub. These are outlined in detailed literature and a website – misplacedterminus.ie – and include concerns over traffic, an absence of transport links and perceived design flaws.Although it would be possible to get the Luas to the terminus, residents argue this will not suit everyone and many, particularly those bound for the airport with heavy luggage, will opt to be dropped off and collected along the small, relatively inaccessible roads around Dartmouth.But for the NTA there are several reasons why Charlemont represents a good option. A spokesman points to proximity of the interchange between the Luas and the Link, much closer than would be the case at St Stephen’s Green. He says the authority believes future extension options are attractive, “whether to connect on to the green line or to provide a metro to the southwest of the city”.Some residents consider the initial work at the site to have been executed without the level of transparency or due process they would like. Many believe it pre-empts the statutory planning process, thus “locking in” the route for the line.“It’s not only that they drilled down physically, but they drilled down psychologically as well,” says Edward Kelly, a retired businessman who has lived on Cambridge Terrace for 25 years, and believes the move will commit planners to the site given the money spent.All signs point that way, but residents still hold out hope for an alternative.“Along with many others on the southside, we have argued that a St Stephen’s Green terminus provides the greatest range of future possible southern route extensions,” residents said in a letter to Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan.Independent councillor Mannix Flynn, one of many on Dublin City Council supporting the residents, believes that of most concern is about the commencement of works at Charlemont. “These are public works. You can’t just turn around and say, okay here’s an opportunity,” he says. “Here is the State undermining the process itself.”For some, it is not just the specifics of the planning at issue, but the nature of how officials have gone about it.Surrounded by design sketches and papers in her Dartmouth Square kitchen, architect Caitriona Shaffrey, who takes a particular interest in the study of urbanism, gets visibly frustrated when talking about the terminus.“We all want a metro but a metro that works,” she says. But the approach of transport officials, to her mind, is “we have to have a metro. The fact that it doesn’t work doesn’t seem to bother them.“They are not listening . . . It’s such an expensive project you have to get it right but we have a history in this country of just pushing things through,” she says.ConsultationLorraine Power, a researcher in social policy, says accusations of “nimbyism” had initially made her reticent to speak out but the process began to feel undemocratic.“They will say they had consultation but it’s just like, talk to the hand,” says Power. She, her husband and four children are among a number of young families to have recently moved to the square. “I don’t want to say it will be terrible because we don’t know,” she says. “But it seems like they are going to spend a lot of money to get to a place that won’t have all the different types of transport to be a hub. We are not set up for that like the way St Stephen’s Green is.”Edward Kelly, who has lived for a quarter of a century in the area, notes that Dartmouth Square was not always the wealthy, sought-after address it is now. In the 1970s it was part of “flatland” homes were often run down and neglected.Kelly shows a picture of the square from 1890 with people picking through a refuse dump. Later, the park would be used as a hockey pitch and in 2006, its then owner Noel O’Gara briefly transformed it into a car park.“It is the case that we live here and enjoy the benefits but we won’t all be living here forever,” Kelly says. “The area will pass on and there’s something wonderful about it that is worth passing on. You want to be able to feel you asked the right questions.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meat plant worker sues over covid 19 infection","story":"Rosderra Irish Meats. It’s Co Offaly plant suffered one of the biggest Covid-19 outbreaks at any workplace in the country during the first wave of the pandemic. Photograph: Diarmuid GreeneA Co Offaly meat-plant worker who nearly died from Covid-19 is suing his employer for personal injuries in the first known damages claim involving a case in a meat factory. Paul Feighery has taken a High Court action against Rosderra Irish Meats Group claiming that he contracted the virus while working at its plant in Roscrea, Co Offaly. Mr Feighery took ill in March 2020. His health rapidly deteriorated and he was admitted to Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore. He spent more than two weeks on a ventilator in ICU before recovering and being discharged in May 2020. He still suffers ill effects from the disease. His solicitors, Deirdre K Ryan \u0026amp Co in Roscrea, confirmed that Mr Feighery was taking a personal injuries and negligence case against Rosderra.He is claiming damages for severe personal injuries, allegedly caused by the company’s negligence, breach of contract and breach of duty, including statutory duty. Total disregardIn his claim filed in January, he is alleging that Rosderra showed a total disregard for his safety and welfare. The company has yet to file a defence in the action.Rosderra chief executive Jim Hanley had no comment. The firm’s solicitors, Benjamin J Higgins, said: “As this matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we cannot comment at this stage.”The first legal case arising from a Covid-19 case in a meat-plant worker could spark a flurry of similar actions by people who claim they contracted the virus as a result of their working conditions.Rosderra suffered one of the biggest Covid-19 outbreaks at any workplace in the country during the first wave of the pandemic. Regarded as an essential food business, the company – the largest pig-meat processing plant in the State – remained open throughout the pandemic. Sinn Féin TD for Laois-Offaly Brian Stanley raised concerns in the Dáil about staff infections at Rosderra in April 2020 claiming that out of about 350 workers in Roscrea, up to 140 were out sick. He claimed at the time that workers who later tested positive were allowed to work next to healthy staff. The outbreak prompted the HSE to mass-test hundreds of staff for Covid-19.Meat plants have been among the workplaces worst affected by the virus as the circulation of chilled air and close-quarters working conditions encourages transmission. A surge in infections out of meat plants in August 2020 led to regional restrictions in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, the first and only local lockdowns of the pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord s week leo s chinese lantern sparks security alert at leinster house","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar: a suspect package addressed to him sparked a security alert in Government Buildings three weeks ago. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinOn a sleepy Friday afternoon three weeks ago, with the Dáil and Seanad in recess and those Ministers still in the whole of their health embarking on St Patrick’s week travels, a suspect package addressed to Leo Varadkar sparked a security alert in Government Buildings.It was deemed serious enough to force a 40-minute closure of Merrion Street while the bomb squad reportedly entered the premises. Gardaí rushed to the scene and closed off the street from Merrion Square as far as the junction with Baggot Street. While staff were not evacuated, the front gates were locked and staff were sent an email asking them to leave via the back entrance.The Irish Daily Mail reported that the package was marked as coming from China and gardaí were called after it was X-rayed at Government Buildings. A subsequent examination revealed the contents did not contain any dangerous items or substances.At the time, the Government press office refused to comment on the report as it “does not comment on security matters” while the Garda press office told journalist Louise Burne: “Gardaí were alerted in relation to concerns regarding the contents of a package at Government Buildings. Following a preliminary examination, no further action was necessary.”They did not confirm reports that the bomb squad was called. The intended recipient of the suspicious package was in no danger one way or the other. The Tánaiste was on St Patrick’s Day duty in Chile.Since the incident, we hear there is much amusement around Government Buildings about Leo’s mysterious parcel from the Orient which set off alarm bells on the security front when what appeared to be electrical components and wires showed up in the X-ray machine.Turns out the package contained a new lamp. A very nice lamp, apparently.We have been unable to ascertain if the Tánaiste purchased it for his Merrion Street office (perhaps already thinking about the refurb when he takes over from Micheál Martin as taoiseach at the end of the year) or for the newly purchased gaff in Portobello.As Tennyson might have written: In the spring, a youngish man’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of lovely lights . . .Pinch of salt for Stephen Donnelly’s health reportEverything is going great guns in the health service. We’ll be world-beating and world leaders in no time, if Stephen Donnelly’s telephone address to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party this week is anything to go by.In the course of a comprehensive overview of developments in his department and the many projects he is working on, the Minister for Health treated lowly deputies and Senators to a glowing progress report. He also wrested credit for the pioneering but ill-fated Mother and Child Scheme in the late 1940s from Dr Noel Browne and gave it all to Fianna Fáil.We understand some TDs had large pinches of salt at hand while listening to the Minister’s rundown of the sterling efforts under way and the many difficult issues which still need to be resolved. But rest assured, their man is toiling “relentlessly”, particularly in the area of waiting lists, diagnostics and consultant recruitment.While he has been doing “huge, huge” work, he also praised Ministers of State Mary Butler and Anne Rabbitte for also “doing incredible work” in the areas of mental health and disability. They, of course, are members of Fianna Fáil, but he graciously remembered the other junior minister, the one who bats for Fine Gael. “A very good guy, Frank Feighan”, apparently.In the course of parping the ministerial trumpet, Stephen, who jumped ship from the Social Democrats to Fianna Fáil in 2017, offered some historical perspective to his audience of dyed-in-the-wool Soldiers of Destiny.Over the years, despite challenges, he said the party made huge differences to the quality of Irish healthcare, citing the decade starting from 1997, when infant mortality fell and the nursing degree and the smoking ban was introduced.He then moved on to list the very many achievements under his own watch. While there is much unfinished business and some serious challenges to address, there is “a lot to be proud of in terms of the national effort”, he said.And that is a scheme, he told colleagues, “which Noel Browne gets the credit for” when actually the previous Fianna Fáil government drafted the Health Act. He said it wasn’t even implemented by Browne’s inter-party administration, without explaining the crucial reasons why. The Fianna Fáil government which came next implemented it, he crowed.Hardly a feather in the cap as the Minister omitted that important technical bit about it being considerably watered down as a result of the same government bowing to clerical pressure.Anyway, in the area of women’s health, he is doing “a really big push”.Super Doolan moves onTeresa Doolan, the first woman to hold the prestigious position of superintendent of Leinster House, is moving on to pastures fresh after two years in the post and taking up a new job within the Department of Justice.Clerk of the Dáil and head of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service, Peter Finnegan, pays tribute to her in his latest staff bulletin.“Teresa has been a brilliant addition to our team a calm, efficient and highly effective superintendent who brought a new outlook to the position. We are sad to see her leave us and her expertise will be greatly missed,” he writes, adding that it was “an immense pleasure” to work with her and wishing her every success in her new role.The civil servant was formerly Enda Kenny’s private secretary when he was taoiseach, and she transferred to the Oireachtas team in Leinster House from the human resources unit in the Department of the Taoiseach.As head of the superintendent’s unit, Doolan was in charge of all security functions relating to the Dáil and Seanad, as well as the infrastructure and accommodation needs of TDs and Senators. She made a break with tradition on her first day in the job – traditionally the preserve of ex-army officers – when asking ushers to call her Teresa instead of using the conventional and formal “superintendent”.There is talk in Leinster House that her predecessor, Paul Conway, who moved to Brussels as the Oireachtas representative at the European Parliament, may be drafted in as a temporary replacement while Derek Dignam, head of communications and international relations, has also been mentioned in dispatches.Teresa’s departure means that two key security positions in Leinster House are now worryingly vacant. John Flaherty, former stalwart of the Oireachtas Golf Society whose evidence to the Golfgate court case in Galway in January was praised by Judge Mary Fahy, finished up as captain of the guard in 2020.Dáil’s drama kings and queensIt should come as no surprise to hear that politicians in Leinster House were broadly in favour this week of Norma Foley’s plan to introduce theatre, film and drama studies to the Leaving Cert syllabus, given the amount of drama queens and old hams populating the benches on all sides.Former Fianna Fáil TD turned disaffected Independent Marc MacSharry was a leading light in Sligo amateur dramatic circles before scaling new theatrical heights in Kildare Street, while Fine Gael junior minister Hildegarde Naughton is a classically trained soprano her Eliza Doolittle and Calamity Jane are still fondly remembered in Galway Musical Society circles.Another paid-up member of the luvvie brigade is Wexford-based Fianna Fáil Senator Malcolm Byrne, who is treading the boards next week in Gorey Musical Society’s production of The Sound of Music. The show opens with a Sunday matinee tomorrow and will run nightly until Saturday’s two-show finale. Tickets are selling fast, with limited availability for some shows. Malcolm’s credits include the role of Juan Perón in Evita, Major General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance and the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz.He is playing Admiral Von Schreiber (who forces Captain Von Trapp back into the Navy) in this week’s show. A minor role, which leaves him free to join the chorus for the waltzing scenes.Meanwhile, speaking of Senators, we must congratulate Tom Clonan for triumphing in the Seanad byelection and taking Ivana Bacik’s vacant Trinity seat after what turned into a nailbiting contest in the final counts. The former Army captain, who turned whistleblower following his research into sex abuse in the Defence Forces, is a disability campaigner and a well-known commentator on defence and security matters.Members of the Upper House are now wondering how their colleague on the Labour panel, lance corporal Gerard Craughwell (special speechifying ops), will cope with not being the Seanad’s only authority on national security and soldiering. Obviously, he’ll still be the leading one. And he can show young Clonan the ropes.Plurilingual praiseMalcolm’s party colleague and namesake Thomas Byrne, the Minister of State for European Affairs, was looking very pleased with himself on Tuesday. There were two reasons: he wasn’t wearing his arm in a sling anymore following an unfortunate funeral-related injury and he had just returned from a conference organised by the French embassy where he spoke in four languages: English, Irish, French and Italian.The ambassador, His Excellency Vincent Guérend, was so impressed he tweeted thanks to the Minister in the same four languages for his commitment to “plurilingualism, a key driver of the EU citizenship”.Thomas addressed the conference on the theme of “Inspiring plurilingualism: stakes and perspectives in Europe”.Is Byrne a plurilinguist? We’re not sure, as he had a script, but we imagine if any TD were to call him one in the Dáil the Ceann Comhairle might boot them out for inappropriate use of language.As for the aforementioned sling, the TD for Meath East confessed to us that he tripped in the church while on his way to extend his condolences to a constituent and suffered a slight fracture to his arm.

It all started when shadow cabinet minister Emily Thornberry signed up her Labour colleagues Rupa Huq, Paul Blomfield, Alex Sobel and Luke Pollard to the group. “She did not want to see this APPG hijacked by a group of Tory MPs fixated on fighting silly culture wars,” her spokesman tells me.The mild-mannered Murrison – now co-chairman with Pollard – is having none of it: “If Emily or any of her colleagues think the Trust would not benefit from parliamentary scrutiny, greater transparency, from being democratically accountable to a huge membership and responsive to its workforce, tenants and army of loyal volunteers, they should say so. Under my chairmanship the APPG and its officers will continue to be the Trust’s critical friend with an open door to its many stakeholders.”Let the battle commence!Julian Fellowes, the Downton Abbey creator, tells me that one of the hazards of being a top screenwriter and producer is that random people approach him with terrible ideas for their own shows. “It happens quite often,” Fellowes said at a Dorchester Hotel event, on the arm of his wife Lady Kitchener to raise funds for sick children.Fellowes – or Lord Fellowes of West Stafford as he is known – adopts a line often used by the Queen. “I just say ‘how interesting’,” he says. That normally does the trick.Two theatrical dames – Joanna Lumley and Judi Dench – were on hand to pay tribute to Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, who stood down this week after seven years. Guests were treated to a “greatest hits” package of Laura K’s toughest questions, notably a corker to Donald Trump from a January 2017 press conference in the White House, when the then-prime minister Theresa May called her for a question.Kuenssberg listed Trump’s previous dubious claims about torture, abortion and Russia, and a ban on Muslims coming to the US, before she asked him: “For many people in Britain, those sound like alarming beliefs. What do you say to our viewers at home who are worried about some of your views and worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?”A shocked Trump turned to May. “This was your choice of a question? There goes that relationship.”Ed Balls has moved onwards and upwards since being unceremoniously thrown out of Parliament by voters at the 2015 general election. But at a fundraiser for the National Theatre, he said his “one regret” was rejecting a role in the musical Grease after appearing on Strictly Come Dancing in 2016.“I got asked whether I would like to play Teen Angel in the touring show Grease,” he tells me. Balls turned it down and the part went to 1970s singing sensation Jimmy Osmond. “It is one of the high points of my life to think me and Jimmy Osmond were competing for the same gig,” he tells me proudly.Before the culture wars were invented, liberal minded Joan Bakewell and conservative campaigner Mary Whitehouse would regularly clash over morals and standards on television in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, Bakewell has lost none of her fire, describing this week how she found Whitehouse – who is the subject of a new documentary – to be “a prudish, narrow-minded campaigner”. But Bakewell added a footnote. “Nevertheless, I visited her when she was dying. We made up.” Perhaps a lesson for today’s keyboard warriors.Boris Johnson has clearly not given up on persuading Christian Wakeford to return to the fold. The former Tory MP crossed the floor of the Commons to become a Labour MP at the height of the Partygate controversy.“I think CCHQ has a malfunction with its email because I got an email the other day asking me to join the Conservative Party,” Wakeford tells me. “I am probably now the last person they want to join ...

They were wrong.”Yet Marina remains remarkably upbeat as she chats about her past, present and future, showing the strength of character that has got her this far, and which she still believes will see her facing Putin in the International Criminal Court one day.Her biggest ambition in life is “to live longer than Putin, and one day see him tried for war crimes and for the murder of my husband”. The war in Ukraine might even have brought that day closer.For now, though, Marina has a rather more introspective mission at hand. She and her son Anatoly are about to begin work on a joint memoir about Alexander, about his murder, and about the international criminal investigation that has dominated their lives ever since.Anatoly was just 12 when his dissident father died, and Marina believes the process of writing a book together will not only help them to relive cherished memories of Alexander, but also confront unresolved, unspoken elements of their grief.“Anatoly was definitely traumatised by his father’s death,” she says of the boy who was taken to see Alexander as he lay dying in University College Hospital, “but he was very protective of what he was feeling inside. He didn’t cry, and it was only when he got older that he started to talk about it.“When we write this memoir together it will be interesting to hear maybe for the first time his feelings about what happened, from his perspective.”Anatoly, now 28, still lives with his mother in their small flat in West London. He has been working as a paralegal but has decided his future lies in IT and is about to embark on a course in computer coding.Marina and her son talk about Alexander – or Sasha, to use the Russian diminutive form – “a lot” and she has always tried to impress on him the fact that “yes, your father died, but in some way he is with us”.Keeping Alexander’s memory alive, of course, has been a highly public affair for Marina, but not one which came easily.“I’m a very private person,” she says, “and I’m always really surprised when people recognise me in the street, though they are always very polite and generous.“What I do in public, I am doing for my husband, but it doesn’t come naturally. When he was lying in that hospital bed I refused to do any interviews. Sasha said I should do them, and tell people what was happening, but I thought he was going to recover so I never thought I would need to.”Before his death at the age of 44, Litvinenko dictated a statement to be read after his passing, in which he said: “You may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life. May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people.” Putin’s blood-curdling reaction to Alexander’s death was to say: “The people that have done this are not God, and Mr Litvinenko is, unfortunately, not Lazarus.”A public inquiry chaired by Sir Robert Owen concluded in 2016 that Litvinenko had been the victim of a Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly KGB) assassination “probably” approved by Putin.It named two Russian agents, Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitri Kovtun, as his killers they had slipped a lethal dose of the radioactive substance polonium 210 into a pot of tea drunk by Litvinenko when they held a meeting with him on Wednesday, November 1, 2006 at London’s Millennium Hotel.Litvinenko told Marina that as he sipped his tea, “in one second he realised something wasn’t right”.Twenty-two days later, he was dead and she believes that if he had finished the cup he might have died very quickly, meaning the cause of his death might never have been detected.Two days after the meeting, he was admitted to Barnet General Hospital, before being transferred to University College Hospital on November 17 when his condition worsened. Doctors diagnosed acute radiation syndrome, and on November 23, after losing consciousness, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died after attempts to resuscitate him failed.And so he became the key witness in the investigation into his own murder. The public inquiry was a personal triumph for Marina, who had spent an entire decade pushing for it, despite the obvious risks to her own safety from taking on Putin and his hitmen.I ask if she feels she has to spend her life looking over her shoulder, but she says she has never had bodyguards and refuses to allow security concerns to constrain her.“In 2006 I was given close communication with the police, which meant I could always contact someone 24 hours a day, and I still have that access, but I don’t really need it,” she says.“I do pay attention to what happens around me – if I see the same person cropping up too many times I might want to know why.”Later this year a four-part ITV series, starring David Tennant as Litvinenko, will dramatise the murder and Marina’s fight for justice, which she hopes will bring the story to a new audience too young to remember the scarcely believable events of November 2006.Anatoly acted as a consultant for the series, but contractual obligations elsewhere meant she could not be involved in the production. Did she meet Tennant? She blushes and smiles, which gives away the answer, even though the official version is that they have never met.Marina, who will soon celebrate her 60th birthday, retains the unmistakable poise of her former life as a ballroom dancer (she still teaches dance), and sits straight-backed on the edge of a sofa as she sips green tea at a hotel near her west London home.]She recalls her first meeting with Alexander, in 1993, when he was working for the FSB investigating organised crime – she was 31 and he was 30.“I had heard about him before I met him,” she says, “and I was really quite surprised when this very young man arrived, looking quite shy. He certainly wasn’t what you expect a KGB man to be!”She was meeting friends for drinks on her birthday (“I always joked afterwards that he was my birthday present,” she says) and Alexander accompanied a friend of hers who was nervous about her safety because of her involvement in a case he was investigating.“Sasha gave you so much confidence. He supported you, he protected you, you felt very confident around him, whether you were his wife, his friend or his child. I never thought I could feel so loved, so protected and so happy.“He was always very open-minded, open to anything new. I never thought I would find all of those qualities in one person.”She also, of course, remembers the last time they spoke, and tears prick her eyes as she recalls leaving his hospital bedside to go home to Anatoly for the night.“I told him: ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon’,” she says. “He said: ‘I love you so much’, and he looked so sad. I tried to make a joke by saying ‘finally you tell me!’, but it was the last thing he said to me. Two hours later he was unconscious.”Campaigning for justice can be lonely work, and Marina does not rule out marrying again one day, saying the idea of having another relationship “isn’t a problem to me”, but that any suitor would have to realise that “Sasha will always be in my life, so it would have to be a strong personality to accept that because most people want to be the only one”.At the start of our interview, before bombarding her with questions about her husband, about Ukraine, about Putin, about Roman Abramovich and so much more, I ask her if there are any particular messages she wants to get across, and her answer comes as a surprise.“Firstly, I’m worried about Russophobia,” she says, without pausing for thought. “Of course I support sanctions against Russia, but now people don’t even want to play Russian music, they want to boycott Russian composers. It’s stupid. The past 100 years have not been good for Russia, but it is also the country that produced Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev.”She accepts that it might seem odd to some people that she is so passionate about defending the country that murdered her husband, but she believes that “there may be a chance for Russia to become a different country” in future.Could she ever see herself going back to a Putin-free Russia if a modern-day Gorbachev were to take over one day and bring about a new glasnost?“When I left Russia I didn’t think I had left forever,” she says, recalling the couple’s arrival in the UK as political refugees in 2000. “There were people who left during the Cold War that knew they were leaving for good, but for me I thought it was going to be temporary.“Now, though, I would be more happy to go to live in Ukraine. It’s a very similar culture I have friends there and there will be plenty of work to do in rebuilding the country once the war is over.”She praises British people for being so “welcoming and open” to taking in Ukrainian refugees, but warns that “they need to be serious about it. “It’s not just about being generous it’s about being capable of supporting people who are traumatised, who have just come from a war zone. People also need to be prepared to be in this for the long haul you can’t just reject someone after a couple of weeks.”She does not have space in the small flat she shares with her son to be able to house a refugee, but is acting as a liaison for others who want to open their homes. She admits the war took her by surprise – a few days before the invasion, Moscow-born Marina was in Ukraine visiting friends in the south-west of the country.“I didn’t think there was going to be an invasion at all,” she admits, “or certainly nothing beyond the Donbas region. There were so many reasons for Putin not to do it, especially the effect that sanctions would have, that I thought he would hold back.”She says the West has been guilty of a collective failure to see Putin for what he is – “someone who has turned Russia into a mafia state and then a terrorist state” – because successive leaders have convinced themselves they knew how to handle him.“During the Cold War it was simple, because the West didn’t really have any personal relationships with Russia,” she says. “But after glasnost the West started doing business with Russia, private companies got deeply involved, personal relationships formed and they wanted to give Putin the benefit of the doubt.”She recalled George W Bush’s meeting with Putin in June 2001, when the US president said he had “looked the man in the eye” and found him to be “straightforward and trustworthy… I was able to get a sense of his soul”.“No-one believed the president of Russia was a real monster,” she says, “but he is and my husband Sasha tried to show it before his death, and he tried to show it through his death.“Russia carried out an act of nuclear terrorism on British soil by murdering Sasha, and it should have been a watershed moment, but it wasn’t.“In 2010 the new government of the UK gave Russia another chance to build its relationship, and more money came in, big donors with Russian surnames gave money to the Conservative Party. It was a big mistake.”She fears the West will become “fatigued” with the situation in Ukraine, and that President Volodymyr Zelensky will accept a peace deal that would be too advantageous to Russia.“It might suit western leaders to push Zelensky into agreeing everything Putin wants so that they can move on, but the Ukrainian people would not accept that, so it won’t be over.”She even suggests that Zelensky’s position as president could be in doubt if he is too accommodating, despite his Churchillian popularity at present.It is Marina’s misfortune that she knows more about Russia’s use of poisons than almost anyone else in the UK, so what does she believe happened to Abramovich, who claims he was poisoned while acting as a go-between in peace talks?“I believe this is all part of a propaganda exercise to frame Ukraine,” she says. “The Russians have already tried to suggest that Ukraine has chemical weapons so that they can stage false flag operations if they want to, and I think Russia will tell its people that Ukraine has tried to poison Abramovich.She believes that ultimately, Putin’s miscalculation in invading Ukraine could have profound consequences for him. “Russia could break up it’s such a huge country that it’s a nightmare to govern, as history has shown.”As for the war, she is concerned that Putin could use battlefield nuclear weapons, but thinks he would not risk all-out nuclear war because “he doesn’t look like a kamikaze he likes his money and his yachts too much”.Even if Putin were to give the order to use tactical nuclear weapons, Marina still has enough faith in the country of her birth to believe his soldiers would refuse to carry out their orders.“My husband refused to carry out orders to kill people,” she says. “I still believe Russia has heroes.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Humanitarian corridors working as thousands evacuated from MariupolReason should guide the gender identity debate40 years on from the Falklands: ‘The deadliest day could have been avoided – it still haunts me now’Norman Tebbit: ‘Too many people in politics today are rather poor material’Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Inside the Dutch ‘torture chamber’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"norman tebbit many people politics today rather poor material","story":"The soothing charm of Bury St Edmunds, with its refined Georgian houses and elegant public buildings, is not a setting one might immediately associate with a man who made his name as the great political street fighter of his generation. But it is in the shadow, appropriately, of the Suffolk town’s great Norman Tower, in one of these handsome houses that another great Norman has chosen to spend his retirement after stepping down from the House of Lords last month: Lord Tebbit, the Chingford Skinhead, the ‘semi-house-trained polecat’, the man who told the unemployed to get on their bikes, the Tory who was more Thatcherite than Mrs Thatcher herself.Tebbit and I have been friends for so long that I can’t recall when I first met him: it was, I think, just before the 1987 general election, when he had returned to be chairman of the Conservative Party after recovering from the devastating injuries he sustained in the IRA’s attack on the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984, during the party conference. The footage of him and his wife Margaret being pulled from the rubble early on that eerily still October morning still has the power to shock not only had the Tebbits nearly been killed, but Margaret’s injuries were so severe that she spent the remaining 36 years of her life in a wheelchair. In all the years I have known Tebbit we have never discussed this life-changing moment, so it is somewhat surreal to hear him today, at 91 – spare figure stooped with age, neatly dressed in a pullover and tie, brilliantined hair white – recollecting such a dramatic event from the serenity of his drawing room. ‘The bombing did make an enormous difference to me,’ he recalls with trademark understatement. ‘Margaret and I had gone to bed. I’d not really wanted to stay on that Thursday night – I just wanted to get home – but I thought it might look a bit untidy on the platform if I wasn’t there. We were woken by the explosion – it was not a big bomb, but big enough to destabilise the big brick chimney, which collapsed. Margaret and I were injured, bleeding, tangled up, and I doubted whether we were going to survive.’‘We were semi-conscious, Margaret and I: there are those famous pictures of me being dug out. A bloke in the back of the ambulance with me, as they took me to hospital, remembers saying to me before he gave me a painkilling injection, “Are you allergic to anything?” and I replied, “Oh yes, bombs.”’Tebbit cracks jokes whenever he can. But as he rattles around his big house, there is a sadness about him that suggests life’s heavy toll sometimes catches up. He was widowed just before Christmas 2020 he and Margaret had been married for 64 years, and their loyalty to one another was fierce. When we speak of Margaret’s death he remains stoical, but the pain is still evident. ‘It was pretty devastating,’ he says. ‘I woke in the night, put my hand out to her and found she was cold, and that she was dead, and that was quite awful.’ The pair met in 1955 when he was a young pilot in the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF) and she a nurse. Young Tebbit had originally, at 16, gone to work at the Financial Times, where, with the help of his school, Edmonton Grammar, he had landed a job putting together the share prices page. ‘The great objective was to see if one could get through an obscene sub-heading for a paragraph,’ Tebbit recalls with a chuckle. ‘All the successes were posted on the wall. Phillips’ rubber soles were very useful in that respect.’ After a national service stint in the RAF, however, the appeal of rude headlines had waned. ‘I got bored,’ he admits. He went off to sell advertising, but kept his hand in as a pilot in the RAuxAF, joining 604 County of Middlesex Squadron. ‘I entered another new world – my flight commander was a partner in a leading firm of solicitors, the CO was a Lloyd’s underwriter. I then began to grow up.’ Not that his childhood until that time had been without event. Tebbit grew up on the borders of Enfield and Edmonton, where Hertfordshire and Essex meet. His father had fought on the Western Front in the First World War, and the post-traumatic stress, or shell shock as it was then, meant that ‘the rest of his life was just useless. He couldn’t cope with anything, really.’ It was his mother, the daughter of a butcher, ‘a very tough lady’, who ‘managed everything. In 1926, at the heart of the general strike she was delivering meat to customers in a pony and trap when a picket line tried to stop her. She simply whipped the pony first and, as they rode through the line, whipped the pickets too.’ Tebbit was eight when war broke out. ‘Probably my most powerful early memory was being at home with my parents and hearing Mr Chamberlain in 1939 say that Herr Hitler had not responded to his ultimatum, and therefore we were at war. And I remember rushing to the window and looking out to see if things looked any different. ‘At the beginning of the war, my brother, who’s three years older than me, and I were evacuated to South Wales. It was so heavily bombed we were brought back home.’ But there was bombing there too: ‘We had a lot of air raids and had to use an outdoor Anderson shelter, which was bloody awful. ‘Towards the end of the war, during the flying bomb raids, my parents were in the shelter and my older brother and I were sitting outside when we heard a doodlebug. When the engine cut, if you didn’t hear it coming down it was going to be pretty close. Well, when it came down, the door flew open, and several houses on the other side of the road were destroyed.’His father’s experiences were what made him choose the RAF for his national service. ‘I didn’t want to risk what my father had gone through. Remembering that we had nearly lost the Battle of Britain, not because we were running out of aircraft, but because we were running out of pilots, I volunteered – I had been highly impressed by the Battle as a child. I got my wings, and started flying Meteor fighters.’ His subsequent return to the RAuxAF sounds idyllic. ‘Somebody once asked me what I did with my childhood. I replied, “I delayed it.” My childhood was spent growing up in 604 Squadron.’As he talks about those days it is clear that it was the camaraderie, and the chance to meet people outside his normal suburban circles, that he found the most appealing. Not least because it also led him to Margaret. He was not entirely oblivious to the opposite sex, thanks to his time at school. ‘It was unusual for those days in that it was a mixed school. There were these girl things, which was interesting because I hadn’t got any sisters, and so one talked to girls.’ Margaret was the daughter of a tenant farmer from Cambridgeshire. They married six months after they met, in 1956, at which point Tebbit decided to put his practical skills to better use in order to fund their married life. He took a job with BOAC, flying mostly on routes to Africa, the Far East and down to Australia. Although he had landed an enviable job, the strains on family life were soon apparent once their first son, John, was born in 1958. Like many pilots, Tebbit found he was rostered to be away on special family occasions, and this became more apparent after their daughter Alison was born two years later William, their third child, was born in 1965. By that stage Tebbit had taken the initiative. ‘I noticed many pilots would simply call in sick when they wanted to be at home, which was causing chaos. I suggested that we be allowed to take control of our own rosters. We did, and it worked: absenteeism dropped like a stone. It was a lesson for my life in politics – always look at the roots of a problem and not just its symptoms if you want to solve it.’Despite this, life with three small children took its toll. After William was born, Margaret suffered from postnatal depression and ended up in hospital, leaving Tebbit in charge of a seven-year-old, a toddler and a newborn. ‘I managed.’ It would not be the last time he would do so. A ll his life Tebbit had been influenced by his upbringing, by a clear understanding of the link between effort and reward, and by the importance of seizing opportunities when they presented themselves. Even before his national service, he became a Young Conservative, because, ‘I realised I was not a statist.’ This was during the period when the Attlee administration, which had ruled since Labour’s landslide victory in 1945, had started to nationalise industries it considered strategically important and to provide cradle-to-grave welfarism. Tebbit had been forced to join a print union when he worked at the FT, and it had given him a loathing of the power of the closed shop. Everything in his upbringing – not least the self-reliance of his parents – had taught him that it was the growth of the inidual, and not of the state or of collectives, that was the key to a successful future. However, during the 1950s and 1960s, the leadership of the Conservative Party did not always think like Norman Tebbit.The parliamentary party had, though, ceased to be the preserve of the privileged classes, exemplified by Ted Heath – from a similar background to Tebbit – becoming leader in 1965. Tebbit, as a party activist in Hertfordshire, disapproved of Heath’s consensual policies, and increasingly in the late 1960s of his management of the party. In a fit of frustration, he wrote a letter of protest to Iain Macleod, a leading member of the shadow cabinet and former party chairman on whose judgment Heath relied heavily. Years earlier, Tebbit had been on the selection committee at Enfield that had chosen Macleod. ‘I wrote to him, presuming on our acquaintance, telling him what was wrong, and what should be done to put it right – I was a young man and so knew all these things! He replied that, if I thought things were wrong and I knew how to put it right, why didn’t I go and help them do it? And I remember saying to my wife, “I bloody well will.”’This was quite a leap from being an airline pilot, but Tebbit had acquired a taste for wider political involvement at a time when his party wanted people such as him – self-made men and women who could relate to an electorate increasingly full of voters with a similar background. Once he had made his decision, Tebbit threw himself into the process of trying to become an MP.‘I knew I had to fight a hopeless seat, do well, and then get a safe Tory seat. I decided the place for me was Epping, which included Harlow New Town, which was a rather Corbynista place,’ he observes. ‘Ninety per cent of the housing was owned by the New Town Commission or the council, and the Labour Party went round at election time to help people put their posters up – or rather, to tell them they were going to put their posters up.‘I think their majority was seven or eight thousand. We fought a good campaign: Stan Newens, my Labour opponent, was very indignant about my first piece of election literature. It was a picture of me standing beside a civil aircraft in my uniform, and it said: “Why does a man with one of the best jobs in Britain want to do something else?” The only place where the word “Conservative” was mentioned was in the imprint at the bottom.’The contest was tight. ‘On the night of the count it became obvious it was close. A recount was called, and I was duly elected: which was not the plan at all. I woke up the next morning in bed in a hotel in Epping and said to my wife, “Oh Christ, what have I done now?”‘She was very supportive, but was a bit shattered about it too. It meant a complete change in our life. She had to go back to nursing to help make ends meet.’The Tory party of the early 1970s was a turbulent place. ‘It was soon quite clear that Heath was making a balls of it. And Airey Neave took me to one side to ask me who I thought would make a better leader. I said, “I don’t know enough.” He replied, “You’d better come and talk to Margaret Thatcher,” whom I’d never spoken to before.‘Having met her, I agreed that she was the one. We had quite a long conversation. What struck me about her was that she was the daughter of a lower-middle-class shopkeeper in middle England. She was a qualified scientist and had worked as one. She was a Christian and she had a powerful intellect. You could guess where she was going to go.’Since he has mentioned Christianity, it occurs to me that there is another conversation we have never had in all these years, but which, given all he has been through, might be relevant. ‘Do you consider yourself a religious man, Norman?’He looks especially contemplative. ‘I started off as an atheist and slid across to being an agnostic: I felt that one couldn’t be certain whether God existed, but I thought it would be rather a good idea if He did, and took more of an interest in our affairs. I have gradually slid to being on the believer edge, so I am an occasional attendee at the cathedral here.’As for whether particular experience of the bomb had affected his view of God, he says, ‘No, I don’t think so. I remember coming round in hospital and finding a nurse sitting next to me. She told me what had happened. I’d suffered a hell of a lot of injuries – broken collar bone, several broken ribs, some had penetrated my chest cavity and my lungs, several vertebrae though not, thank God, my spinal cord, the top of my left hip, and all sorts of bits and pieces.’He was moved to Stoke Mandeville to be with Margaret, who was in the spinal injuries unit there. He was made to eat all he could to build up his body tissue. ‘The doctor said to me, “It’s bloody awful food, so to assist you I’ll send you in a case of red wine, which you can keep under the bed.” It was the health service at its best.’Severe though his injuries were, they did not compare with his wife’s. ‘I realised that she was very badly injured right from the beginning. It was clear that she was never going to walk again.’ It was six months before he could return to work, so he ran his department, with the help of officials, from his hospital bed. Considering the extent of Margaret’s handicap, did he consider leaving public life at once?‘No. That would have been to give the IRA another victory… The only occasion when I was ever cheered from all sides of the House was when I came back in after the hospital to take my seat.’ At the time of the bomb, Tebbit was Secretary of State for Trade, running the Thatcher programme of privatisation. He was seen as a natural successor to her: he had already become ‘the Chingford Skinhead’ – a coinage believed to have been made by Private Eye and, thanks to Michael Foot, also a ‘semi-house-trained polecat’. Did he mind? ‘No. Not really. It made me laugh. I remember calling Foot a fascist. He was upset about that. He was even more upset the next day when a newspaper said, “Tebbit was right: Foot is a fascist.”’He declined to serve, however, in the cabinet after the 1987 election. ‘It was because of my need to earn more money to look after Margaret.’Above his desk there is a photograph of Tebbit, sleek and dashing in white tie and tails, looking tenderly at Margaret as she dabs her eyes. It was taken when she went out in public for the first time after the bomb, at a smart City dinner. One only needed a few moments with Margaret to gauge the extent of her heroism, but Tebbit’s, in overcoming the attempt to murder both of them and then devoting much of the rest of his life to caring for her, is no less immense. The bombing remained with him. A couple of years ago, he finally gave up game shooting: I used to see him twice every season at a pheasant shoot in Norfolk where his Danish son-in-law Paul was the estate manager. I can testify to his accuracy – and he was rumoured to mutter ‘Adams’ or ‘McGuinness’ every time he pulled the trigger.   ‘I was once asked what would I do if I bumped into Adams and McGuinness. I said that as long as I was driving a heavy truck when I bumped into them I would laugh. The IRA were the great beneficiaries of the Good Friday Agreement. They were all given get-out-of-jail-free cards by Blair, while they continue to prosecute the soldiers who were trying to protect people against the IRA: monstrous, absolutely monstrous.’He thinks public life has changed ‘for the worse’ in his half-century in Parliament. ‘There have always been bounders of one kind or another. But now I think there are far more people who have gone into politics with the aim of getting into a job in government, and they have on the whole been rather poor material. There are one or two who’ve got ability and integrity. I think the leader of those is the Chancellor. But I think you could make a better cabinet, a smaller cabinet, and a cabinet principally of people who had not been career politicians all their lives.’So what now for Tebbit the polecat? Now that he has retired, will he slide gracefully into the sunset? He has full-time carers and he is close to his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Tebbit family values remain cast-iron, and all three of his children provide a serious support group for him.He feels comfortable in Bury, and plans to spend the rest of his days there. ‘After Margaret died I thought whether I should sell this place, and go and live in sheltered accommodation. Then I realised I might not like that, and I’d have buggered it all up. So I’m going to stay here. It’s a lovely house.

Energy bills are soaring by around % today National Insurance is going up on Wednesday and inflation is soaring.Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week unveiled cuts to fuel duty and tweaks to National Insurance in his Spring Statement - but neither will help the poorest part-time workers who donapost have a car. And he unveiled just £m of extra support for benefit claimants in distress, at the same time as inflation wipes out £bn of benefitsapos value this year. Labour leader Keir Starmer said today: The Government really needed to step up in its Spring Statement last week.They failed to do so and their response is frankly pathetic on a very, very dficult day for millions of people.  Energy bills are going up far more than weaposve ever seen on record. People are really struggling and I just donapost think the Government gets it. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse today insisted Chancellor Rishi Sunak could act again, but warned the UK had “huge debt” and it would only happen “ the economy allows”. He said: “He is monitoring it on a daily basis,he needs to move further in the future,the economy allows us to do that, don’t forget we’re carrying huge debts at the moment, then I know he’ll look very seriously at doing so.” Hereaposs a breakdown of some of the biggest bill rises coming that have demanded political intervention. And we look at what intervention -any - was offered to help.Energy bills riseDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:The energy price cap has risen to a record £,-a-year for a typical household. Around million Brits on iable tarfs have been hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April .A second hike that could be just as big or even worse is expected on October . WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Rishi Sunak previously announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ repayable rebate off energy bills in October.But he announced no new cash help in the Spring Statement - despite speculation he was going to raise the £ or delay the date to start repaying it beyond April . Council tax riseDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Englandaposs average Band D council tax bill has gone up by £ to nearly £, a year. Official figures show the .% hike - despite Tory ministers insisting most rises would be capped at % - will bring Englandaposs average bill for a Band D home to £,.Now of course, most people’s council tax will be lower than last year due to the £ discount for Band A-D homes in England. But there are two big catches. First, that £ is meant to pay for energy bills - not absorbing the cost of a tax rise. In Rutland a Band D bill will go up by £, wiping out much of the £ discount. Second, the £ is a one-off. Next Spring, you’ll suddenly feel the force of not just this year’s rise but also the April  rise at the same time.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no changes to the council tax bills and no increase to the £. Councils were given another £million to help the hardest-up families via the Household Support Fund - doubling it to £bn. But this is dwarfed by inflation wiping out £bn of the value of benefits.

Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachersDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Inflation tipped to peak near % means planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April and backdated - will be wiped out by rising prices.Ministers have already spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. The Royal College of Nursing is demanding % above inflation.And civil service organisations can make average pay awards up to just %, with a further % to be targeted at specic priorities. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no extra cash for public sector wage rises. They are already having to be funded out of departmentsapos existing budgets - those did not rise in the Spring Statement.Royal College of Nursing General Secretary Pat Cullen said: “The cost-of-living crisis means some are having to choose between filling up their cars and feeding their children. [Spring Statement] fuel measures are not enough to stop nursing staff subsidising the NHS when they fill up their car.  VAT s to % in pubs and restaurantsDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:From today VAT s to % in pubs and restaurants, and other hospitality venues - inevitably raising the prices for punters while inflation is already raging.The VAT rate had been cut due to the Covid pandemic and despite the cost of living squeeze, itaposs ing to the full rate as planned. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED: Rishi Sunak announced nothing to stop the VAT hike. UKHospitality Chief Executive Kate Nicholls said: “Locking in VAT at .% would have given hospitality businesses a major boost, and helped the sector in its ambition to lead the UK back to post-Covid prosperity.As it is, thousands of jobs could be lost, the UK will remain uncompetitive versus international rivals, and already hard-pressed consumers in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis will see price rises in their favourite pubs, bars and restaurants, further fuelling inflation. A real-terms cut to Universal Credit housing supportDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:At the start of the Covid pandemic, aposLocal Housing Allowanceapos - the amount of Universal Credit you get to cover your rent - was raised to match the cheapest % of rents in your local area.But this has been frozen in cash terms since then and has been frozen again for a year from April . The National Residential Landlords Association said the freeze while inflation soars was simply absurd and will exacerbate the already serious cost-of-living crisis.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:No change.A real-terms cut to childcare helpDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Poor parents will be hit hard by this monthaposs cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation.Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:You now the message by now - there was no change to this. Nor was there help for the childcare sector or schools more generally, beyond what was announced in the Autumn.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “Like every household and business, schools are facing crippling rises in energy costs, to be funded from already stretched budgets.” InflationDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:UK CPI inflation hit .% in February. The Budget watchdog now says itaposll rocket to an average of .% this year - and could peak at nearly % thanks to the Ukraine-Russia war.That -year high will mean the pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel, and tightens business margins to the point firms could go bust. It means real household disposable income set to fall .% this year - the biggest since records began in .WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor cut fuel duty, raised National Insurance thresholds and increased a Household Support Fund in what the Treasury claimed was £.bn of help. But it wonapost help the poorestand he admitted he canapost stop the tide of inflation. Mr Sunak said: “The OBR have not accounted for the full impacts go the war in Ukraine and we should be prepared for the economy and public finances to worsen - potentially signicantly”.The IFS think tank warned even with everything put together, a middle earner on £, can still expect to be £ worse off this year than last year.  Interest ratesDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Last month the Bank of England increased interest rates to .%, despite warnings it would “crush” households already drowning in the cost of living crisis.The Bank took the move to slow the economy down and cool soaring inflation . Governor Andrew Bailey recently appealed to workers not to ask for big pay rises, as that fuels inflation further. But it will mean new mortgage rates become more expensive, and inflicts an overnight rise to monthly payments for people on standard iable rates. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor had his hands tied on this one as interest rates are decided independently by the Bank of England.There was no new help for homeowners in the Spring Statement, apart from knocking the % VAT off green home improvements like solar , insulation and heat pumps. Meanwhile the Bank rate rise has knocked £bn off the public finances by making borrowing more expensive, wiping out the National Insurance rise in one fell swoop. Petrol pricesDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Petrol prices have hit record highs due to Russia ’s war in Ukraine. The average price of petrol reached .p a litre while diesel rose to .p a litre Sunday before last.A month earlier they averaged .p and .p a litre respectively. A family car with a typical -litre tank is now paying £.p to fill up compared to £. a year earlier. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Fuel duty was cut by p a litre in the Spring Statement last week, until March .The Chancellor said it was the biggest cut ever and the Treasury boasted the fuel duty cut, along with a freeze already planned, will save the average van driver around £ this year - or £, for the average haulier. But it will still only knock around £ off a -litre tank for a family car. The Resolution Foundation said it will save the typical driving households £ a year, but evenpassed on in full by garages, it will only reverse % of the increase in pump prices over the past year.  National Insurance riseDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING: A £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.Employees will pay .p more in the pound on earnings above the threshold, a rise from % to .%.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Mr Sunak raised the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance by £, to £, - claiming itaposd save Brits up to £ a year.Of all the cost of living rises facing Brits this is the one Rishi Sunak came closest to sorting out. But this doesnapost factor in a . percentage point rise in the same tax . This will cut into the £ saving, and outstrip it entirely for anyone earning over £, a year.Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves accused Rishi Sunak of “making an historic mistake” by failing to scrap a tax hike on jobs, warning families will “endure signicant hardship”. Officials are also confident that inflation is so high, there will still be more National Insurance coming in overall - despite thresholds being raised.Income tax ‘stealth tax’DATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll have to carry on paying % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £, - just like this year.According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . The IFS think tank now warns it’s a £.bn ‘stealth tax’, two and a half times bigger than first thought. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Rishi Sunak announced no changes to the thresholds despite a campaign to do so. The National Insurance thresholds are more generousbut income tax remain frozen.The IFS said as a result, almost all workers will be paying more tax on their earnings in  than they would have been - even when the tax cuts are taken into account. Student loans aposstealth taxaposDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped.The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Nothing for the student finance system or graduates repaying loans. Quite the contrary - the small print of Budget forecasts shows the long-term changes to the student loan system will net tens of billions for the Chancellor.It will save the public finances £.bn in   and an average of £.bn a year over the following years.  Massive real-terms cut to welfare benefitsDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Benefits will rise by .%, as little as £. a month on the rate of Universal Credit.Tory MPs pushed through the plans earlier this year - saying it was in line with inflation. But inflation has since doubled to .%. This will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most, with food bank use soaring as food prices in the supermarket rise by a predicted %.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no changes to benefits despite speculation he could tweak work allowances in Universal Credit.His allies claimed he didnapost need to act again after raising work allowances and cutting the taper rate in the last Budget. But these measures only help people in work - as do most of the measures announced last week, too. Once again, those who cannot work due to sickness or other reasons are left behind. Pensions are being cut in real terms - before rising next yearDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Pensions could rise by more than % next April after the Tory DWP chief promised to bring back the triple lock - despite soaring inflation.Therese Coffey suspended the triple lock - a solemn manesto pledge - for one year in   because post-Covid wages were bouncing back in an “anomaly”.That sparked fury as it meant the state pension will rise by only .% next month, less than inflation. That is a real-terms cut of £ to Britain’s million pensioners, Shadow DWP chief Jon Ashworth said.But Ms Coffey said the triple lock wouldin   as promised. That could lead to a rise of .%, experts predict.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Like above, Rishi Sunak announced nothing extra to help pensioners.Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation said: “The increase in the household support fund and changes to the National Insurance threshold are welcome, but there will still be many families on the lowest incomes who are very anxious about the cost of living, particularly rising energy bills.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementPoliticsCost of Living: Were Here to Help\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tonight the BBC reports the Indian IT company is now trying to find replacement roles abroad for staff employed in Moscow. Mr Sunak has previously rejected allegations his family has been benefiting from Vladimir Putinaposs regime when pressed about his weaposs stake in Infosys.He told Sky News he had nothing to do with that company and said he had absolutely no idea whether Infosys was following the signicant actions put in place in response to the invasion. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Earlier, Keir Starmer demanded to know whether Mr Sunak’s family was benefiting from cash made in Russia.The Labour leader said: As the Chancelloraposs we is concerned, thereaposs just a fundamental principle, is their household benefiting from money made in Russia when the Government has put in place sanctions  That is in the public interest for us to have an answer to - Iaposm not attacking their family but I do want to knowthe Chancelloraposs household is benefiting from money from a company thataposs investing in Russia when the Government is saying quite rightly that nobody should be doing that.  Earlier this week, Mr Sunak angrily hit out at his we and her family being thrust into the spotlight. “I think itaposs totally fine for people to take shots at me, itaposs fair game - Iaposm the one sitting here and thataposs what I signed up for,” he told BBC Newscast. Itaposs very upsetting and wrong for people to try and come at my we and beyond that actually, with regard to my father-in-law, for whom I have nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that heaposs achieved. No amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because heaposs wonderful and has achieved a huge amount. “As I said, Iaposm enormously proud. The Chancellor has previously urged business owners to think very carefully about any investments that would in any sense support Putin and his regime as fighting continues across Ukraine. Labour aposs deputy leader Angela Rayner has said Mr Sunakaposs ties to Infosys amount to a conflict of interest, and has demanded Mr Sunak declare his we’s shareholdings in the usual way on the Register of Members’ Interests.She told the Mirror: One minute he is telling British companies to think carefully about investments that in any sense support Putin and his regime - the next we hear his family are making millions from a company operating out of the Russian capital. This company, founded by Sunak’s father-in-law, has been handed millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money in contracts. Rishi Sunak must come clean about whether he is personally benefiting from business in Russia and whether he has declared this conflict of interest to the Permanent Secretary orheaposs been profiting in secret.Despite allegations of hypocrisy, Mr Sunak has insisted he has “followed the ministerial code to the letter” and has previously denied benefitting from doing business in Russia. A spokesperson for the Chancellor told the Mirror Ms Murthy is a minority shareholder in the firm, adding: Neither her nor any member of her family have any involvement in the operational decisions of the company.

Sir Keir said: He told the House no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown. The police have now concluded there was widespread criminality. The Ministerial Code says that ministers who knowingly mislead the House should resign. Why is he still here  Boris Johnson scoffed hang on a minute! and accused Keir Starmer of being a human weather vane after the Labour leader stopped short of repeating his call for the PMaposs resignation last week.  The PM said the Met Police - whoaposve warned they could issue more fines beyond the  anonymous ones so far - must “get on with their job” adding: We are going to get on with our job.But Keir Starmer said: There are only two possible explanations.“Either he’s trashing the Ministerial Code, or he’s claiming he was repeatedly lied to by his own advisors and that he didn’t know what was going on in his own house and his own office. “Come off it! “He really does think it’s one rule for him and another rule for everyone  - that he can pass off criminality in his own office and ask others to follow the law.” Labouraposs leader added: When is he going to stop taking the British public for fools  It came after Boris Johnsonaposs deputy today finally admitted  staff broke the law over Covid lockdown parties - after No bizarrely tried to avoid saying they did.Dominic Raab also confirmed ministers like Rishi Sunak will inevitably disclosethey get fined. So far, No has only pledged to name Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.Scotland Yard yesterday said it would hand out  fines to people over parties in Downing Street and Whitehall.Yet the PM still appeared to be in denial. Pressed over Mr Johnson’s view, his spokesman said: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment, rather than the Prime Minister.”Today Mr Raab, who is the Justice Secretary and once prosecuted war crimes, accepted the  fined people broke the law saying: Clearly there were breaches of the regulations - that’s the only thing that could warrant the  fixed penalty notices”. Last night Boris Johnson threw a glitzy bash for Tory MPs, hours after the Met confirmed Downing Street lockdown parties had broken the law. The PM hosted around  MPs for dinner at a central London hotel as he attempted to bolster his leadership and draw a line under the Partygate scandal. Politicians were set to dine on salmon tart, chicken thighs and a chocolate praline dessert, washed down with fine wines. Top Tories walked past families who lost loved ones to Covid, who held a candlelit vigil in protest outside Londonaposs Park Plaza hotel and shouted at MPs: Off to another party, are we  One Tory MP, Michael Fabricant, told the waiting media the party would be a lot of fun adding: Itaposs great, we had a photo taken, it was absolutely super. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford blasted: Last night millions of families will have been desperately trying to figure out how they will possibly afford the £ energy price hike that will hit them this Friday. At the very same time, Tory MPs were gathering across the street for a champagne bash in the Park Plaza. We all know the Tories partied during lockdown and now they’re partying through this cost-of-living emergency. Earlier Keir Starmer blasted the PM and “cynical” Chancellor Rishi Sunak for putting the  Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills by promising a p income tax cut. The PM insisted he was still a “tax-cutting Conservative” - but Keir Starmer told Mr Johnson to “cut the nonsense and treat the British people with a bit of respect”. He said the Tories were imposing  tax rises, bringing the tax burden to its highest for  years and for every £ taken in tax rises, £ is given back. “Is that cutting taxes or is it raising taxes ” he mocked. Boris Johnson fumed: “I don’t know where he’s been the last two years…. “Even for Captain Hindsight, to obliterate the biggest pandemic for the last century from his memory, to obliterate the £bn we’ve had to spend… is quite extraordinary.” But Keir Starmer said: “I can only hope that his police questionnaire was bit more convincing than that. This year British people face the worst fall in living standards on record. While they are counting every penny, the Prime Minister is hitting them with higher taxes.“But in  when there just so happens to be a general election, they will introduce a small tax cut. That is not taking dficult decisions, itaposs putting the Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills. How did he find a Chancellor as utterly cynical as he is  Prime Minister Boris Johnson replied: What we have is a Chancellor who took the tough decisions to look after the UK economy throughout the pandemic, who protected people up and down the land with £ billion worth of support. And by the way,we had listened to them,we had listened to Captain Hindsight, we would not have come out of lockdown in July last year. We would have stayed in lockdown over Christmas and New Year, with the result that the UK economy would not be growing in the way that it is. And so we would not be able to make the investments that we now are and under Labour we would have to tax more and borrow more and they cannot be trusted with the economy.

But the plans have already been criticised, with unions saying ministers have not gone far enough and the British Ports Association pointing out ports cannot enforce wage rules. Mr Shapps also outlined plans to close minimum wage loopholes and clampdown on fire and rehire practices. He will ask the Insolvency Service to consider disqualying PO chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite from acting as a company director, after the boss brazenly admitted to MPs the firm broke the law by not consulting with unions or notying the government. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This plan has gaping holes. It won’t deliver a fair outcome for the  sacked workers, and it won’t stop another PO-style scandal.  “Closing the legal loophole which lets companies pay less than the minimum wage is a start, but we need much more from the Government. “Ministers must do everything they can to ensure PO reinstate staff on their previous pay – a union-negotiated rate that is signicantly higher than the national minimum wage. “That means severing all ties with DP World, including lucrative freeport contracts. “Andministers really want to stop companies firing at will, they must go further than a feeble statutory code and finally deliver the long-promised Employment Bill to boost worker protections. “Without stronger employment legislation, bad bosses will continue to trample over workers’ rights.”  British Ports Association, Richard Ballantyne, added: While itaposs right the government and the ferry industry look to improve employment rules and standards, the expectation that port authorities will need to enforce minimum wage rules in the shipping sector could be unworkable. This will place ports in a dficult legal predicament, especially before any legislation is in place. DP World-owned PO Ferries sacked its crews and replaced them with agency workers on March . The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and over is £. per hour. Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  that the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour, but insisted this was permitted under international maritime laws. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Shapps said: “Where new laws are needed, we will create them. Where legal loopholes are cynically exploited, we will close them. And where employment rights are too weak, we will strengthen them.” Mr Shapps said HM Revenue  Customs will dedicate “signicant resource” to ensure all UK ferry operators are “compliant with the national minimum wage, no s, no buts”.Employers will be prevented from using “ fire and rehire tactics”they fail to make “reasonable efforts to reach agreement through consultation”, the Transport Secretary said.Mr Shapps added of the proposals: “It’ll send a clear message thatyou are using British waters and British ports to ply your trade then you must accept British laws.” Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh told the Commons that the steps announced by the Government to “insist on the bare minimum cannot come a moment too soon”. PO Ferries has accused the Maritime and Coastguard Agencyof operating with “an unprecedented level of rigour” after it detained two of its ships. European Causeway was held in Larne, Northern Ireland, on Friday, while Pride Of Kent was detained in Dover, Kent, on Monday.  Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, was also unimpressed with the plans, saying: “Despite all the bluster, Grant Shapps has failed to grasp the opportunity to adequately stand up to the banditry behaviour of PO. “The Prime Minister repeatedly said to Parliament that the Government would be taking legal action to save British seafarers’ jobs, but he has failed to keep his word. “This continued lack of action and courage has meant a ferry company owned by the Dubai royal family has been able to break our laws and disrupt our ports and ruin people’s lives with impunity, and we will keep pressing the Government to ensure justice for our members. “What has been announced today is far too little, too late, and we are calling for urgent action for speedier, more radical reforms to save the UK seafarer from oblivion.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Keir Starmer said the government “just doesn’t get” it as Kit Malthouse said his family is finding it “quite tricky... day-to-day”.The North West Hampshire MP made the comment on the same day he receives a £,-a-year pay rise for MPs. Speaking in front of a burning fireplace in his home, the father-of-three told LBC Radio: As you know, Iaposve got children. They need to be fed and that cost is rising. My fuel prices are rising quite signicantly, and I have to say that in my constituency Iaposm on oil central heating still, sadly. He added: We are feeling it very signicantly. MP Neil Coyle, who sits on the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee said: “Malthouse should apologise for his gross insensitivity and focus on helping his constituents and everyone battling budgets rather than talking about himself.”Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: Just how out of touch are this lot The fact a government minister in the wealthiest % of taxpayers is struggling will ramp up furious pressure on Rishi Sunak to announce more help.Last week the Chancellor made National Insurance thresholds more generous and unveiled a temporary fuel duty cut - but neither will help the worst-paid part time workers with no car as incomes drop by the fastest since records began in the s.  He has already announced a £ council tax discount that not everyone is eligible for, and a £ energy bills discount that only comes in October and must be paid back. Keir Starmer blasted the Government’s “pathetic” response as National Insurance, energy bills, council tax and inflation all soar - with bills expected to jump again on October . Energy firms’ websites crashed yesterday as people submitted meter readings ahead of today’s £ surge in annual bills. Charities said the rise will double the number of ‘fuel stress’ families struggling to pay the gas bill to million. The TUC demanded an emergency budget with general secretary Frances O’Grady saying: “This is a living standards emergency. Last week’s Spring Statement was woefully inadequate.” And parents told Save the Children they would be giving their children shared baths and cold dinners, or even sending them to bed hungry. Bethany Fern, a -year-old single mum to a seven-year-old and three-year-old from Southport, told the charity: “Iaposm going to try and cut back even more on what we spend on food and try to freeze more.“We’ll be eating a lot more cold meals, triple-checking that plugs are turned offnot being used and limiting TV even more than we already do. “We already have the heating off a lot, and my children rely on extra layers, duvets and weighted blankets. “They have to have shared baths or not fresh baths between each other to preserve the boiler from heating water.” Another single mum-of-three, who works full time, told LBC Radio she keeps her kids warm with hot water bottles, can only afford one meal a day and eats their leftovers.Heating oil - used by many rural homes and not subject to the price cap on gas and electric bills - has rocketed in price after Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine and peaked at p a litre last month.Minister and father-of-three Mr Malthouse said: “Lots of people in rural areas are suffering from the oil price rise. So we are feeling it very signicantly.“I have to confess to you, we did convert last year to electric vehicles, so we are feeling the electric price but not through the petrol. So it is a challenge for everybody. Mr Malthouse earns £, as an MP following a .% rise today. Together with his salary as Policing Minister he earns £, a year.He said his family tradition was to have the heating off from April  - but with Britain hit by late Spring snow and ice, he had lit a fire in his fireplace.Mr Malthouse had been asked directly what other “economies” he was having to make in his household. He insisted Chancellor Rishi Sunak could act again, but warned the UK had “huge debt” and it would only happen “ the economy allows”. He said: “He is monitoring it on a daily basis,he needs to move further in the future,the economy allows us to do that, don’t forget we’re carrying huge debts at the moment, then I know he’ll look very seriously at doing so.” Save the Children director Dan Paskins blasted the government’s response - including raising benefits by just .%, half the inflation rate - “isn’t good enough”. He said: “The rise in energy prices will be devastating for families on low incomes. “We’ve already seen families having to choose between heating their homes and feeding their children. “These price rises will undoubtedly leave millions of parents wondering how they will be able to cope in the months ahead. Unless families are provided with more support, this increase in energy bills will leave more children living in cold and damp homes, going to bed hungry, and missing out on the opportunities they need to grow and thrive.” One working single mum who remained anonymous told the charity: “I actually feel physically sick. I feel pressurised to work more hours even when Iaposm already working as much as I can.“I often do more work after my daughter goes to bed to make the most of the time I have without it affecting her.” Labour leader Keir Starmer blasted: I think most people are clear that ... the Government really needed to step up in its Spring Statement last week.“They failed to do so and their response is frankly pathetic on a very, very dficult day for millions of people. “Energy bills are going up far more than weaposve ever seen on record. People are really struggling and I just donapost think the Government gets it.  Government minister Kit Malthouse said: I canapost pretend to you it isnapost tough. It is going to be.” Liverpool-born Mr Malthouse, , is a close ally of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Before entering politics he was a chartered accountant at Deloitte before setting up County Finance Group. As chairman, he trousered £,-a-year for between  and  hours’ work a month, according to the MP’s register of interests. He is believed to have given up the role after becoming a minister in early . He also holds shares in County Finance Group Ltd and County Business Finance Ltd.  He was elected to the ultra-safe Tory seat of North West Hampshire in  and enjoys a , majority. He married Juliana Fahrain  years ago. She is managing director of Kun Europe, which “provides a range of services to The Kun Shoulder Rest, the worldaposs leading shoulder rest for violin and viola”. They have one son and one daughter together. He also has a son from a previous marriage. Labour’s leader urged ministers to examine hiking benefits by the rate of inflation - .% and set to peak at almost % - instead of .% now which is a real-terms cut. As the cost-of-living crisis intensied, the Labour leader said people were “tossing and turning in their beds about how they’re going to pay for this”. He said people are “seeing nothing from the government”, who “don’t realise” how badly people are struggling. He added he was hearing of people keeping the heating at C as they canapost afford any more. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets.

Mum Laura Jordan, , from Redditch, Worcs, said her son Zac would not cope in another mainstream school as she believes he has special educational needs. The Mirror previously reported on how Zac had spent more than five months at home following his expulsion, leaving him scared to go outside. Worcestershire County Council now has less than a month to find Lauraaposs son a new school before pupilsfrom the Easter break on April .The local authority previously wanted to put Zac, who recently turned five, into a mainstream school however the council has now performed a U-turn.  Mum-of-two Laura told The Mirror: Zac had an autism assessment on March  and on the back of that the local authority said Zac wonapost be ready for mainstream school yet. I believe he will now be able to go to a special school. Iaposve got a meeting with the local authority on Tuesday, hopefully they will have a school for him by then. I feel that Zacaposs needs have now finally been recognised.As a result of the article and the pressure Iaposm putting on them I hope he will be back in school by April . I said to the local authority that we are running out of time as the kids break up next week. He should already have a place in a school. Progress is definitely being made but I feel itaposs purely because heaposs reached five years old now and the local authority have to prove him with somewhere. Zac was booted out of Holly Hill Church School, in Rubery, Worcs, in October after a number of behaviour problems, including attacks on other pupils and staff. Soon afterwards Laura discovered that councils are not required to get kids back into schoolthey are expelled before their fth birthday. The mum previously said: Zac started reception in September and within five weeks he had been permanently excluded.  Ever since heaposs been out of school as he was only four and the compulsory school age is five. Itaposs very rare for this to happen to a child his age. Itaposs pure discrimination, the whole thing. I donapost think itaposs morally right heaposs out of school when people the same age as him are able to go to school. Heaposs been left behind because heaposs been excluded and offered no alternative schooling provision. Heaposs missed out on his education. This is going to affect him for the rest of his le. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The mum does not deny that her son has issues, accepting that he attacked other children and staff at his school. However, she believes he has autism, ADHD and speech and language problems, which make certain situations aposoverwhelmingapos for him. Laura previously said: He was excluded because heaposs got special educational needs and the school was not able to meet his needs. They couldnapost keep him and others safe. But they couldaposve done other things before resorting to excluding him. This wouldaposve involved a possible managed move or alternative provision. Ultimately, they didnapost give him chance or time to adjust to his environment or the new staff in his classroom. She added that the council had requested two special needs schools for Zac, however both said they were full.The mum previously said Zac would have no choice but to attend a mainstream schoolthe council placed him in one, however she fears he would simply be expelled again. Laura said The Mirroraposs article had helped raise awareness about the struggle parents face when fighting for educational support for children with special needs. She thinks the UKaposs compulsory school age should be lowered to four years old so children cannot be expelled and left at home once they have started education. A Department for Education spokesperson previously said: “Suspensions and permanent exclusions should only be used as a last resort, but we back headteachers to suspend or exclude pupils where it is necessary and helps maintain calm classrooms.“We are consulting on changes to behaviour and exclusions guidance to make sure this is used in a fair way, and the cross-government SEND Review will further consult on how children with special educational needs and disabilities are supported by the system, including in alternative provision.” Local authorities are responsible for arranging full-time education for excluded pupils once they reach compulsory school age. A spokesman for Worcestershire Children First, which provides education support services on behalf of the county council, said: “Our SEN services are currently working closely with the family to secure the most appropriate education provision for Zac.” Worcestershire County Councilaposs cabinet member for education Marcus Hart previously said: “Parent carers have a statutory right to ask for a particular educational setting and support for their child but it can at times be challenging to find the right place that has capacity and can meet a child’s inidual needs.The law requires all children to start full-time education by the beginning of the term following their fth birthday and we are working with Ms Jordan to find a suitable and appropriate school that meets Zac’s assessed needs, ready for him to start school in April. We are sorry that we have been unable to source an educational provision for Zac that has been able to meet his needs for this period and we acknowledge this is unacceptable for Zac, indeed for any child. We are continuing to work alongside Ms Jordan and relevant healthcare providers and partners to ensure that we have a high quality, lawful Educational Health and Care Plan in place for Zac, that will help to ensure he receives the tailored help and support he needs at all stages of his educational journey.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Schools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Despite the combined efforts of those on the ship, a spotter plane, a helicopter, and nearby merchant vessels, the rescue operation was suspended hours later. The passenger, believed to be British, is now feared to have drowned. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereThe Virgin Voyages cruise ship Valiant Lady hosted performances from s pop icons including Tony Hadley, Toyah, T’Pau, Altered Images, ABCaposs Martin Fry and former Radio  DJs Bruno Brookes and Gary Davies. After the search was suspended, the ship resumed its journey to Portsmouth - finally docking  hours later than planned. According to the Mail, further inquiries onboard show the man appeared to deliberately jump over the side of the ship, though no CCTV footage has yet been made available.  Passengers paid up to £, for the cruise - aimed at a demographic of young at heart adults and kitted out with restaurants, bars and a nightclub. But the trip was blighted by several incidents throughout its voyage, including one destination being dropped from the itinerary altogether. At one point, a passenger became gravely ill and had to be air-lted off the ship by helicopter. Passengers have also claimed there were multiple covid infections, leading to staff creating an area for those who had tested positive to isolate in. Another guest said: Everyone among the passengers is devastated by what’s happened - it’s just horrible to think that a fellow passenger has probably died.  A Virgin Voyages spokesman said: In the early hours of the morning, we were informed of a man overboard incident involving a Sailor [passenger], which resulted in a search and rescue mission. Weaposre deeply saddened by this news and our thoughts are with this Sailor’s family and loved ones. Our investigation indicates that this was an intentional act and that no foul play is suspected.

Environmental policy consultant Mavourneen Conway, , from Norfolk, UK, and husband Chris first tried their hands at home renovation when they added an extension onto their first house several years ago. With three boys - Ciaran, , Liam, , and Owen,  - the couple decided to find somewhere with more space for them to grow up, so purchased a five-bedroom Georgian farmhouse in March . Rolling up their sleeves, the family got to work on creating their dream home, with most furniture thrted and upcycled.  My husband grew up in a family whereyou could do it yourself, you gave it a go, said Mavourneen. His approach has certainly rubbed off on me. Building the extension to our first house taught us both a lot of skills and gave us a lot of confidence to try things. Our kids have also gotten stuck into lots of our DIY projects so hopefully theyaposll do the same when they grow up.  Iaposve always loved being creative, and DIY has given me a great outlet. Itaposs so satisfying being able to learn something new and make something yourself. With all the information available online, thereaposs a tutorial for pretty much anything which makes it so much easier to try doing things yourself.Mavourneen has developed a love for DIY, and is passionate about finding pieces second hand that she can upcycle. My first DIY project in our new home was turning a coffee table I found second hand into an ottoman, she said. Iaposd never upholstered anything before so that was a learning curve. Now Iaposve got six dining chairs Iaposve found that all need upholstering too. I also did my first bit of DIY art recently and Iaposm excited to do more of that.  Iaposd love to get into carpentry and building things from scratch so Iaposve got a couple of projects that Iaposm thinking about to give that a go. Some of Mavourneenaposs other upcycling projects include giving a makeover to a piano she found for free, which her son is now learning to play, creating a vanity unit from a £ chest of drawers she got second-hand, and creating a lampshade out of an old cat bed. I love our new DIY vanity unit, but our oversized ottoman will always be a special project as it was my first time upholstering anything, said Mavourneen.  Over Christmas I loved doing a DIY hanging wreath, and the boys and I made some oversized outdoor light baubles by using wire flower baskets tied together and wrapped in fairy lights. Iaposm hoping to be able to use them in the garden this year as they had such an impact. With a love for DIY, Mavourneen and her family have been keeping down costs as they renovate the home. The cheapest transformation by far has been the bathroom, which only cost us about £ to do, she said.  There is such a huge list of other priorities, and the fixtures and fittings in the bathroom were generally sound so we had to work around what we had.We made a new vanity unit out of a chest of drawers I found on Facebook marketplace. We used a lot of items we already had and just repurposed them, including the vintage light fittings and the vintage mirror.We found a vintage cast iron radiator second hand for £ which my husband installed.  We also made some peg shelves to go around the bath which cost £, and decided to seal and paint the wooden floorboards to save on flooring. In terms of the other rooms, the new kitchen was the biggest expense, costing £,, as we had to start from scratch. We had to open up and reinstate a fireplace, as well as replace all the units and worktops. However we saved the old units and turned them into a utility room in the cellar. We also kept and repaired the  year old vintage La canche range cooker that had been left behind by the previous owners.  We saved money by sanding and refinishing the old parquet floor ourselves. Weaposve also kept and painted the dining table that we were left from the first property we rented  years ago instead of buying a new one and Iaposve bought second hand dining chairs which Iaposm currently refinishing. Our light fitting is actually an old woven cat basket that I found in a charity shop that weaposve turned into an oversized pendant light over the dining table. I think my style is still evolving, and has certainly changed a bit to suit the kind of property we now live in. Thereaposs so much inspiration out there now that itaposs almost impossible not to keep adapting and refining your style.Iaposd say my style is a mix of natural, rustic and modern traditional elements. Iaposm also drawn to some eclectic items having lived abroad for so much of my le, so I like to incorporate those too. I love thrting unique items, thereaposs nothing better than a good second hand find. The children also get involved with shaping their home, knocking old tiles off walls and helping to paint the kitchen. Mavourneen added that there is still plenty to do in the house, and that the full transformation could take up to ten years.  We only moved in a year ago, so weaposve just scratched the surface of everything that needs to be done, she said. So far weaposve redone the kitchen, the living room, one of the bathrooms and the boysapos bedroom. But even those rooms arenapost finished as thereaposs a long snagging list. Sometimes the scale of what weaposve taken on feels overwhelming but I have to try and remember that this is a - year project and that I need to be a bit more patient with progress.  This year weaposre hoping to build a treehouse for the boys, tackle the hallway, the cloakroom and to make a start on the garden. Iaposve found a gorgeous second hand brass sink that I canapost wait to install in the cloakroomI can just find the right unit to fit it on to, whilst Iaposve given my husband some plans for the garden furniture Iaposd like us to try and build. After that, we have four more bedrooms, two bathrooms, a study and a conservatory on the list of rooms to sort so itaposs going to be a long process. Weaposve bitten off a bit more than we can chew but itaposs a joy to be able to restore a home like this.

There are hundreds, sometimes it even looks like thousands of birds just everywhere.They fly over people and poop everywhere. Iaposm scared I’ll get unwell because they come so close to you.” Some local residents and shoppers in Croydon say harsh measures should be taken to curb the problem. Karl, from East Croydon, said: “I think they should all be killed. They’re pests so why do we not just get rid of them  Every single summer should just go round and clear loads out. Would make everyone’s lives easier”.  Around the town centre there are signs not to feed the pigeons but with the abundance of birds in the area some locals don’t think these measures are working. Shop owner and beautician, Anna Tali, , said: “The pigeons are a real pain. They just annoy everybody. No one actually likes them and it doesn’t help business having loads of birds flying over you and pooping everywhere.” She explained that already businesses were struggling because of the aposslow recoveryapos following the pandemic and pigeons werenapost helping.  She didnapost know how much of an impact they were having on footfall but explained that aposthey surely canapost helpapos. A spokesperson from Croydon Council said: “The council doesn’t have a policy to control or cull birds within the general area and the advice to residents and businesses is to take pigeon-proofing measures to stop them perching roosting and to ensure that there isn’t a food supply for them. British Pest Control advises that food restriction is the best way to manage pigeons. If the council receives a specic complaint about an inidual feeding pigeons – and that this is leading to a public health issue – then it would investigate that further.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Birds\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old had his son Daice with a childhood friend who he began dating when he was . After seven years of being in an on-and-off relationship, the -year-old realised he wanted to live his le openly and told his girlfriend that he was gay. The two childhood friends are still close and Joe credits Daiceaposs mum as being one of his aposbiggest supportersapos - saying she was happy that heaposd told her the truth. Since becoming single and embracing his sexuality, Joe has found himself having to explain how he has a child on a aposday to day basisapos.  Meanwhile, his status as a dad has invited mixed responses on dating apps, with some singletons claiming he has apostoo much baggageapos. But TikTok videos showing Joe embracing le as a dad have been met with widespread praise. Joe said: I donapost think a lot of people get that Iaposm gay just from speaking to me, so when they find out Iaposm gay and a dad, theyaposre just a bit like aposWhat the f**k  How apos I find myself explaining it on a day-to-day basis. Joe says he already knew he was gay but his close friendship with Daiceaposs mum meant they just found themselves in a relationship at a young age. Joe said: I met Daiceaposs mum when I was eight years old. She used to train with me and weaposd do lyrical contemporary dance competitions together. As we got older, our friendship grew and grew. When I was  or , weaposd basically gotten to a stage where we knew we loved each other and we decided weaposd give it a go.  We were together for about seven years. It was on-and-off, we had our ups and downs, but we were best friends. I knew I was gay but because we had such a strong connection and were so close it was just easy. There was never really a moment where we said aposdo you want to be together apos, we got together and it just didnapost stop. We ended up having Daice together. It wasnapost planned as such, but we both wanted children. After he was born we got to a point where we thought apossomething isnapost rightapos. I was growing up thinking aposI like guysapos. In my mind, I knew things werenapost working out. It was in early  that we broke up. I think when COVID happened, it made me realise what was important. Leaposs too short to live it unhappily.  It was an amicable split, it wasnapost nasty or anything, we were really open and honest with each other. Sheaposs still one of my biggest supporters and my best friend. She was happy that I was honest with her, that I wasnapost leaving to be with other girls, I just needed to be who I am. We spend so much time together, we still go out for dinners. I donapost have Daice full time but I see him a lot. Iaposm very involved in his le. Joe never had a formal aposcoming outapos and grew up hiding his sexual orientation as he feared being ostracised at school. Joe said: I always knew I was gay, ever since I was little. My mum said she knew since I was two.I was a huge Miley Cyrus fan and I always wore a little blonde wig acting like I was Hannah Montana - the signs were there.I think I never come out before because I already got bullied at school for being a performer so I knewI said I was gay it would have been worse. I didn’t want people to think I was weird so I suppressed it for a long time. I knew but because I was so close with Daiceaposs mum it was easy. It was like a friendship that just grew and grew. We ended up having a baby out of it and weaposre both really happy with how it happened.  I never really had a aposcoming outapos. I never felt the need to sit everyone down and tell them I was gay. I was really down at the start of , I just thought that I needed to change my whole le around. I just needed to get to a place where I was happy. We were at a point where we werenapost really speaking, we were so unhappy. The relationship was over before it was over. I didnapost need to tell her, she knew I was like a Hannah Montana-obsessed person. She just asked me one dayIaposd date guys and I said apos%. It feels right, it feels rightapos. She was just happy that I was being open and honest. Joeaposs status as a young gay dad has drawn a iety of responses in real le and online, particularly as he navigates the world of gay dating.  Joe said: You obviously get the people who say aposyouaposre sick, itaposs wrongapos. Theyaposll say that because Iaposm a gay dad, but I couldnapost care less. I am who I am. Itaposs massively rewarding being a dad, my boy has made me who I am today. I was so down and my boy gave me the motivation to sort my le out. I look at le dferently. I feel like I have a purpose and thereaposs a reason for me to go out and work hard every day. Iaposm definitely looking to meet somebody. Some people think I might have too much baggage, but Iaposm open about having a son on my dating profiles.Do you have a story to share  Get in touch at webfeatures@trinitymirror.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TikTok\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, an expert locksmith has revealed that is simply not the case and that burglars are out on the prowl whatever the weather. Elizabeth Johns also said that many Brits make a common mistake during the winter by not wanting to stand outside in the cold ripping up large cardboard boxes.  Many will leave these boxes, often which have branding of high-cost items such as TVs or games consoles, leaning against the bin - giving burglars a key indicator as to what they will find inside your home.She told the Sun : In the summer, itaposs very easy to go out to your bin and put boxes in but in the colder weather, a lot of people donapost want to go out all the way to the bins to rip boxes up to put them in the bin.So they will leave boxes out that have markers on them of high-value items. Any high-value items that come in big cardboard boxes can be quite a chore to rip up and put in the bin in the colder weather. She added that it is vital to ensure that these are hidden from burglars because it will alert them to the fact high-value items are in the property.

Eligibility criteria apply. aposWe had loads of jobs but not enough people to fill themapos Screenprinting business Paul Bristow Associates is just one of the employers who’ve worked with Jobcentre Plus to fill vacancies. The family-run firm, based in Wrexham, produces textiles including T-shirts and printed bags – and they’ve been keen to attract younger people to roles. “One of the issues we have is the perception of manufacturing as being something we used to do in the Victorian age but no longer,” says director Ben Bristow. “Of course that’s not the case – but it made it hard to attract young people. Working with Jobcentre Plus gave us the ability to get more young people into the business and provide them with a good grounding in print and textiles.  “Our staff collaborated really well with the team at Jobcentre Plus, who gave excellent support and deserve high praise indeed.” HR manager Lee Dixon, , agrees: “The people who work there have done a fantastic job. It’s not been easy through Covid and the fact they’ve managed to help people into work is great. “It’s also massively helpful to us as an employer, given there are loads of jobs but not enough people to fill them. Through working with the team at Jobcentre Plus we’ve built up a great rapport. They’ve been first-class. “Our recruits have been a massive help in bringing in valuable skills to our business,” says Lee. “We’ve had them working in packing, admin, sewing and sales. Another guy has got a position in sustainability after he joined us from university. We’ve also had people with additional learning needs and disabilities.”apos My team made me feel very welcome and supported me apos “When I left college in January  I didn’t finish my A levels because I wanted a change, but then obviously the pandemic happened. I didn’t particularly know what I wanted to do, but I knew I would be good in a computer-based job because it’s something that I’ve gravitated towards. “Then I saw JD Sports was advertising opportunities and I thought I’d go for it because it was an administration role in a big company. It was actually the first that I applied for and everything went through really quickly – and I got the job. “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel very welcome and supported me. Day to day I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me pretty much a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since. “I’d always had an interest in HR, but after working for six months I realised it was what I wanted to do. “There was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD and CIPD Level  in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year and I’m really enjoying it. Starting work was quite tough, but I’ve got so much support from my team. It’s a lot more friendly than I expected it to be.“Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing before. I was struggling to find any job with noexperience, but now I’ll just keep going.”Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, on how the company has forged links with Jobcentre Plus. “We are proud to have worked with Jobcentre Plus to provide much-needed employment and learning and development opportunities at a time when competition for job positions has been at an all-time high. Social inequality has only been exacerbated during the pandemic, so it has never been more vital to give young people a chance to succeed. “Our relationship with the DWP now covers all three nations across the UK and gives our stores, head office and distribution centres access to new talent pipelines and initiatives, which not only facilitates our future recruitment needs, but also allows us to support candidates facing social barriers, an area we are hugely passionate about.” “When I was developing my start-up in the renewable energy sector, working with Jobcentre Plus allowed me to recruit new graduates. “We’re part of the Edinburgh Business School incubator, where we get office space, mentoring and support. Since the graduates joined, we’ve moved to the stage of building a prototype.“If it wasn’t for the scheme, recruitment would have been years away –and having a few more minds to work on the concept has given us a competitive edge.“The candidates knew when they joined that they wouldn’t just be working on their own tasks and would be learning something every single day. If you’re looking for experience, it’s a great way to get it.”apos It’s important to personalise our service apos “Our service helps employers and our customers meet each other face to face, which is crucial. Employer advisers speak to both employers and the Work Coaches, who’ll send customers over who are ready for work. “We can also help employers st through CVs and hold training events to get people work-ready and match them up with the role they’ve got available. “I’ve been working closely with Lee at Paul Bristow Associates, who came along to events at the jobcentre where groups of young people could come and speak to him about what roles they had available. “A lot of employers weren’t aware of all the great services we offer, but the feedback we’ve been getting has all been really positive. Every employer’s needs are slightly dferent, so personalising our service is really important. “There are lots of sectors that are struggling to fill places, so we can help companies find a pool of candidates. We have large manufacturing areas in North Wales that are struggling to recruit people. There are also plenty of roles in the hospitality and care sectors.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Department for Work and PensionsJD SportsLee DixonJobs CentreMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton real wrench royal","story":"Kate Middleton has real wrench on royal tours that make them dficult, says expertAlthough she often appears composed and confident when travelling abroad on tours, Kate Middleton finds one part of them particularly dficult, according to one royal expertthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video royals-arrive-prince-philips-memorial-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:bcdccbccd,sourceUrl:,site:Undefined,brandSafety: Distressing news – passed for ad targeting,showSuggestedVideos:true,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:WmBGymEU,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

She and Prince William spent last week on an action-packed and sometimes dficult royal tour that took in Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas.Despite the fast pace, Kate appeared confident and composed at engagements as they met a range of people across the three countries. However, despite appearances, royal expert Katie Nicholl says these tours are often a wrench for Kate and there is always one thing about them she finds dficult - leaving her children behind.For their journey to the Caribbean, her three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis stayed at home.And Katie told Closer magazine : I remember being with her when we were on a tour together in Bhutan [in , when Princess Charlotte was just  months old] and we had a moment to talk about how dficult it was to leave little children behind.“Despite being the Duchess of Cambridge and being able to afford around-the-clock nannies and so on, she had her mum looking after Prince George and Princess Charlotte, which struck me as just really normal.

It is the most high-profile royal event by far that the two youngsters have attended with William and Kate keen to give them and younger brother Louis as normal an upbringing as possible.

The -year-old was charged with outraging public decency, Croydon Magistrates Court was told today. He admitted the charge and blamed his behaviour on stress and a medical condition. A member of the public filmed him, with the video viewed tens of thousands of times after being shared online.In the -second clip posted on Twitter, the officer is seen sitting on a bench in the park with his police cap by his side.He looks over his shoulder to seeanyone is nearby and then can be seen watching something on his mobile phone before he commits the sex act.  The member of the public who filmed the sickening act confronted the PCSO and photographed his badge number, leading to him being arrested. The PCSO works in Met Police’s Roads and Transport Policing Command admitted the offence when questioned after it happened on Wednesday. He appeared in the dock wearing a burgundy sweater and was told to catch his breath before taking a seat. Phillips, from Croydon, who had no previous convictions, spoke only to enter his guilty plea and confirm his name, date of birth and address. District Judge Nigel Dean sent the case to Croydon Crown Court, where Phillips will be sentenced on a date to be fixed. Phillips was released on bail only on the condition he does not enter a park or recreation ground in England or Wales.His solicitor, Tahir Ali, told the court Phillips is married with two young daughters. The video posted online appeared to show a man committing a sex act on a London park bench in broad daylight, according to the MailOnline. The footage was brought to the attention of police shortly before .pm on Wednesday, the Met said. The forceaposs directorate of professional standards is leading an investigation and Phillips has been suspended from duty. A referral has been made to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct.  Commander Kyle Gordon of the Metaposs Roads and Transport Policing Command has now issued a statement condemning the video which has horried and saddened the force. Commander Gordon said: “I know that everyone will be absolutely shocked by this video. I am absolutely horried and saddened by incidents such as this, as are all decent officers and staff. They are contrary to everything we stand for. I would like to reassure everyone that we are working as fast as we possibly can to identy the full circumstances of what took place. As soon as we became aware of the video just before midnight we acted immediately. Officers worked throughout the night and a serving member of police staff was arrested in the early hours of this morning and taken into custody. As a criminal investigation is now under way we are limited in what further details we can discuss. However, we will keep the public updated at signicant stages of the inquiry.

Barbara Young, , took the two electric scooters worth £ from Smyths in Eccles after voiding a transaction.When a shop worker realised what had happened he took a picture of Youngaposs Fiat  and threatened to call police, the Manchester Evening News reported.She was with her sister and her son when it happened. Young, of Bolton, walked out of the store with the scooters and put them in the boot of her car, whilst her sister was stopped by the store assistant as he realised a bag for le hadn’t been paid for. The woman apologised and handed him the bag for le back. It was only once he ed to the checkout he noticed the transaction had been voided in relation to the scooters, Manchester Crown Court heard. “He followed her to the car park and saw the defendant in the driving seat, and saw a male and a child in the front seat,” Juliet Berry, prosecuting, told the court. “The second female explained to the defendant that they needed to get the scooter out of the boot, to which she said the boot wouldn’t open. At this point the store assistant became suspicious and took a photo of the registration plate and said he was going to call the police.”  Young’s sister then jumped into the car as Young drove at him. CCTV of the footage showed the man clinging onto the bonnet as she drove away, shortly before he slumped to the ground. She then drove over his feet as she made good her escape. An hour later the car was found abandoned, along with one of the unicorn scooters and another bag for le. The store assistant’s phone was found on the edge of the windscreen. Following a check of the car by the police and DVLA, Young was found to be the registered keeper, but the vehicle itself was on  plates and she wasnapost insured. The man sustained numerous injuries including abrasions to his sternum, back, elbow and knuckles. In a victimaposs personal statement he said the impact on him physically and mentally was ‘hard to put into words’. Five months on from the incident he still has no diagnosis despite still suffering pain. “I have to keep going - I just keep living in this cycle of pain and torment,” he said. Young was said to have seven previous convictions for  offences including shoplting, driving without due care or attention and driving without insurance. Jane Dagnall, defending, said the car had been a gt from her family, but didn’t know it was stolen. She said she only knew the car was on  plates after her arrest. “Her instruction is that it wasn’t something she wanted to do. There was very little thought,” Ms Dagnall said. “She has been on remand for two months. The clanging of the prison gates has affected her. It hit home what it’s like to lose her liberty. “She is a young woman, she is a mother of two and she is totally ashamed and remorseful.” Jailing Young, of Crompton Lodge Caravan Park, Hall Lane, for  months, Recorder Paul Reid QC said: “You got into a car which you had no right to be driving. You had your child with you. “It’s perfectly clear he was standing immediately in front of your car. You couldn’t avoid seeing him. You chose to drive off with him in front of you, it wasn’t just a nudge, you drove into him with such force that he was propelled on the bonnet of the car and was hanging on. “You must have known you had driven over him, yet you didn’t stop to seehe was alright, such was your keenness to get away. It’s a miracle he wasn’t more seriously hurt.” Along with her prison sentence, Young, who pleaded guilty to theft assault occasioning actual bodily harm and dangerous driving as well as driving with no insurance no licence and failing to stop after an accident was banned from driving for two years and nine months and made the subject of a restraining order for seven years.

Stacy Watkins, , was told she had months to live when she was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cervical cancer, which had already spread to her liver and pelvis, last October. The devastating blow was made even more horric when partner, Dan, , discovered a tumour on his spine, leaving their two children terried. Now, with the mum-of-two crippled by chemo and unable to walk, the family, from Reading, Berkshire have issued an urgent GoFundMe appeal to help them raise £, to fly to Mexico in a last ditch chance at saving her. Dan told The Mirror : This could be her last shot. When she was diagnosed six months ago, they told us that she had aposmonths left to live and more months with treatmentapos so we are on a time limit here. In that time she has taken a real nose e, the chemo is so gruelling on her body that she canapost walk anymore, she can sleep for  hours and still feel tired, and sheaposs in so much pain it can hurt just to hold a glass of water to her lips. Itaposs heart breaking to watch her go through all this because she is the rock of the family she is the one that has kept us strong throughout everything we have already been through. The family have already lived through years of le-threatening illnesses, after both their children, Hayden, , and Tia, , were born with crippling heart defects.  Tia needed a transplant and Hayden needed a pacemaker after they were diagnosed with congenital complete heart blocks - a disruption of the nerve system which regulates the pumping of the heart. More recently, the couple were also helping their own parents battle cancer but had coped thanks to supermum Stacy who has been the rock of the family. But after a routine blood test came back suspicious in October, doctors performed more tests and diagnosed the mum with a neuroendocrine tumour on her cervix. The type of tumour is particularly rare and dangerous because it affects the cells which release essential hormones into the body.  In the weeks following, the family were served a double blow when Danaposs backpain turned out to be a complicated tumour on his spine, for which he is still awaiting biopsy results to seeit is benign or cancerous. Speaking to The Mirror after launching their appeal last month, Dan said: “It’s literally been a whirlwind of a le, it’s coming at us from every single angle. “One of these things to happen in a letime is bad enough but all of the things happening at the same time, it’s like living in your own horror movie. Now the family have found a promising alternative treatment plan at the Hope  Cancer clinic in Mexico, where Dan says medics have already had success with Stacyaposs type of cancer.The £, target would pay for her flights, accommodation, immunotherapy, supplements andvisits for check ups. He added: It would mean everything to give Stacey this chance to live longer. All the kids want is their mum back and itaposs so frustrating that I canapost give them any certainty, As a family we have never asked for anything, we have just got one with it but now we are begging anyone and everyone to help us do everything we can to save Stacy.To donate to Stacyaposs GoFundMe click hereRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cervical cancerCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Smile and wave, he says, standing symbolically high on his moving pedestal, the corners of his mouth slowly slipping. Why isnapost everybody cheering for the white man  Will thinks.Yes, the monarchy benefitted from slavery. Yes, protestors are calling for reparations. Yes, Iaposm completely out of touch but I got up on stage and declared slavery should NEVER have happened. What more can I do  I wonderthis was a mistake  Kate whispers - the first thought sheaposd formed on her own in a while - as she shakes the hand of a Black child through the prison- I mean gates. Safe to say, the standing symbolically high on his moving pedestal deserved the backlash it created. But from it, talk about the royalsapos hard work ethic and dedication to duty also arose. Itaposs the perfect smokescreen to move on from the controversy something the royals have had plenty of practice with. But in doing so, they stick their fingers up at the public once again, and dig themselves an even bigger hole. Will certainly takes after Daddy, Prince Charles, who is impatiently twiddling his thumbs for his five minutes of being King.  The Prince of Wales was crowned the hardest working Royal back in  - after completing  engagements. Republic states this is the equivalent of aposworkingapos  and a half days - a measly fraction of the average full-time worker, who puts in more than  days a year. And that would be fineCharles was on a pro-rata salary and just looking for a little bit of cash to fund his gardening projects. But no, the Royal has a personal income of more than £ million - meaning he gets to shake peopleaposs hands and poses for photos for an eye-watering £, an hour. We need to get rid of the idea that any of the royals are hard-working.

Either way it has raised hopes for Andrew that he can have an important role for the Jubilee events to mark the Queen’s  years on the throne. It comes after he was removed from public le and paid suspected millions to settle a civil sexual assault case involving Virginia Giuffre. He has always denied any wrong-doing in the case.“Prince Andrew does want to participate in the Platinum Jubilee celebrations and to be present at the St Paul’s Cathedral service of thanksgiving and to pay tribute to the Queen’s magnicent  years of public service, a royal insider told the Express.“The Prince and Queen do have a close bond. The Queen knows exactly what she is doing. She’s very much in charge.  A packed itinerary to mark the royal milestone opens with Trooping the Colour and the Queen’s Birthday Parade, on June . Then the St Paul’s service next day is followed by a trip to one of the monarch’s favourite engagements – the Derby at Epsom. Other key events include a Platinum Party, when some of the world’s top entertainers perform at Buckingham Palace, and the Platinum Jubilee Pageant.

While Her Majesty has been scaling back on her public appearances after a few bouts of poor health, she was recently accompanied by the Duke of York at a memorial for her late husband Prince Philip. The move was seen as a way of confirming Prince Andrew still plays an integral part in family le.It comes after Andrew paid off his sexual assault accuser Virgin Giuffre with a reported £million just three weeks ago. He has always denied the allegations made by Ms Giuffre and denied ever meeting her. The two heirs to the throne Charles and William were said to have been “shocked” and dismayed” as Andrew emerged front and centre.  However, Vanity Fairaposs Royal Editor Katie Nicholl said the Queen deliberately chose to have Andrew play such a prominent role on the day and shows the public she still aposmakes the decisionsapos. Katie Nicholl said: This was the Queenaposs way of showing two things one, that the buck stops with her, and she makes the decisions, and secondly that she believes heaposs innocent. She made the point very, very clearly. But Charles and William were very aware of the perspective, of the optics of this.  Unfortunately, this picture [of Prince Andrew escorting the Queen] has overtaken what should have been a memorial to a great man. Andrew has spent a considerable amount of time with the ailing -year-old monarch, who has suffered from a series of health problems in recent months as well as recovering from Covid.The Duke of York, who lives on the Windsor estate, has also been ever present at his mother’s Windsor Castle home after the death of her beloved husband Prince Philip, who died last April aged . It is believed he still holds ambitions of staging an unlikelyto front line royal duties, despite being banished being stripped of all his royal titles over Ms Giuffreaposs allegations that he sexually assaulted her in , when she was a -year-old former sex slave of his paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein..

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.

Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation. After the disastrous royal colonial relic tour of the Caribbean, the head of the creaking institution also undermined a family business suddenly feeling very out of date.

He would dress like a stable lad and amid the ensuing mayhem when the race finished, grab the winner’s reins and march it confidently to the winning enclosure. A couple of times he made it, leaving us doubled up with laughter as the TV cameras were taken in by the centre-stage con man. I thought of him on Tuesday during Prince Philip’s memorial service when Prince Andrew led his mother up the aisle of Westminster Abbeyand putting himself bang in the centre of the national spotlight again. But I doubt many royals were laughing. Because how it looked, and what it said, was utterly abysmal. He wasn’t just allowed to escort the monarch to her seat by the way, but conscious that he is now unable to use his HRH title, the Queen decreed no other royal should be listed as HRH in the order of service. It was a callous and crude attempt to rehabilitate a disgraced man with an indecent haste by those at the top of this country.  It is barely a month since the royals agreed a £million payout to Virginia Giuffre who alleged she was forced to have sex with Andrew after being trafficked by his paedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein. ­Allegations he denies but allegations that he halted being tested in court by paying his accuser. The royals pushing him back into the centre of national consciousness as though nothing had happened was a kick in the teeth for every woman who has ever been abused and felt powerless to do anything about it. As Nazir Afzal, former Chief Crown Prosecutor for North West England, who specialises in cases of child sexual exploitation tweeted in reference to Andrew’s appearance: “I’m all for ­rehabilitation but it starts with facing justice, accepting responsibility and working to rebuild victims’ confidence. None of that is present here so far.” Allowing the Queen’s son to be her escort in such a public way said we royals do what we want because we are above you all. That the stripping of Andrew’s titles and honours was a pretence. It said we may live in an era when accusations of sexual harassment against high-profile men drives them into obscurity, but it’s OK. The one accused here is the Queen’s son. He’s got superior blood.  Also, Virginia Giuffre was held as a sex slave by Andrew’s friend, whom he visited on many occasions. Did the link not occur to a family that had just walked into a huge row in the Caribbean about their role in the slave trade  Did The Firm not imagine, after that catastrophic image of an aloof William and Kate driving through Jamaica in all their colonial finery, how appalling this would look  I think William did, as he looked as exasperated and uncomfortable sitting in a row behind his disgraced uncle in the Abbey as he had on that Caribbean tour. I wouldn’t be surprisedhe was wondering what the point of it all was and whether it’s right to force his kids into being players in this antiquated circus. You can but hope.

The bug, which causes nausea and vomiting, usually sees a surge in the winter months but had been kept at bay by covid restrictions. With Brits now free to mingle more than previously, germs are spreading more easily. Care homes and schools are often the worst affected by norovirus outbreaks, which then quickly spread within families. Experts have since warned parents to act fastthey notice any symptoms and to regularly wash their hands with soap water, as hand sanitiser is ineffective at killing the virus. The UK Health Security Agency, which monitors outbreaks of the vomiting bug, has urged Brits to be vigilant as cases continue to rise. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereLesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety, UK Health Security Agency told The Sun the increased cases were due to a relaxing in covid restrictions. Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs, she added. Ms Larkin urged Brits to stay at homethey were experiencing symptoms and to avoid ing to work or sending children to nursery until at least  hours after symptoms have cleared. Those who believe they have contracted the virus are advised to keep as hydrated as possible and stay clear of elderly relatives, especially in care homes or hospitalswhile they are feeling sick. Handwashing is key to help stop the spread of this bug, but unlike for Covid- alcohol hand sanitisers do not kill off norovirus, so soap and warm water is best, Ms Larkin added.Anyone suffering from norovirus symptoms can book a phone consultationthey are concerned, but are advised not to see their GP in person. Norovirus can easily spread through contact with infected patients or contaminated surfaces, however, the virus usually passes after a couple of days. Covid restrictions also saw flu cases lower than usual during the winter months, but as restrictions have lted these too have begun to pick up. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, cases are still relatively low but have nevertheless seen an increase over her last week. Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist for the UK Health Security Agency, told The Sun the increase was likely to increased mixing in office workspaces and urged Brits to regularly wash their hands to curb the spread. He also encouraged those believing they are suffering from flu to work from home until they are feeling better, and to avoid contact with elderly relatives.

Metaldehyde pellets have been used as bait to control slugs, snails and other garden pests, but the government has moved to ban their sale and use after it was was advised that pellets can severely poison other animals Instead, gardeners have been advised to use beer to kill slugs instead. Experts from the charity Garden Organic say slugs love the drinkaposs yeasty aroma, meaning they are at least happy when they fall in and drown.The charity found that slugs are  times more likely to be caught in a trap containing lager than water, with bitter  times more effective than water, the Daily Mail reported. Garden Organic’s head gardener Emma OaposNeill said: Slugs love lager. Many gardeners know that slugs are confirmed lager louts and their love of this tipple can certainly distract them from your plants. The smell of lager and bitter really seems to attract them. The charity advises using copper tape to protect plants from slugs or luring them underneath an old roof tile with a piece of lettuce. It also recommends raised beds and containers to deter the creatures. Garden Organicaposs chief executive Fiona Taylor said that the ban on metaldehyde pellets had been a long time coming.  Metaldehyde pellets have long been recognised as posing an unacceptable risk to birds and mammals, she said. There have been cases of dogs ingesting pellets, leading to sickness and even death. Toxins can also find their way into rivers and freshwaters, posing wider harm to the environment and other wildle. We are pleased that the government has listened to safety and environment experts about the huge risks of this chemical, which far outweigh any benefits. We hope this is the start of a range of measures which sees an end to the use of harmful pesticides.  If we care about wildle and the future of our planet, we must make the positive move to organic, environmentally friendly methods for our gardens, allotments, balconies and pots. Announcing the ban in September , farming minister Victoria Prentis said: The scientic evidence is clear – the risks metaldehyde poses to the environment and to wildle are too great.

Telescopes were lined up at observatories to scan the clear blue skies for the first hint of the crescent of the new moon before reports came in that it had been seen in Sudair, Saudi Arabia. The first full day of Ramadan, with fasting from dawn to sunset, will be tomorrow - April . Some Muslims follow the Saudi announcements but other Muslim communities wait for veried moon sightings from the UK, Morocco, or where, so Ramadan can y by a day or so. That means that for some it will instead start on Sunday.In Australia, an early declaration of the date of Ramadan this year was made, Birmingham Live reports.  The Australian Fatwa Council posted on March  that it had decided Ramadan  would also begin on April , because it knew from astronomical data that it would be easy to see the moon on April . Saudi Arabiaaposs Umm al-Qura Calendar had already predicted Ramadan to start on April , . It says the month will finish on May , with the next monthstarting on May  with the three-day festivities of Eid al-Fitr. The Umm al-Qura Calendar is used by the government of Saudi Arabia for civil purposes, with its dates determined at the Institute of Astronomical  Geophysical Research in Riyadh.  Islamic Relief UK has a calendar predicting the same dates. This calculated lunar calendar is also followed by several neighbouring states on the Arabian Peninsula such as Bahrain and Qatar. However, the HM Nautical Almanac Office, a British Government agency that produces astronomical data for organisations including the armed forces, police, religious groups and diary calendar manufacturers, predicted that it would only be possible to see the new moon on Friday in a few locations, including parts of South America, the USA and Caribbean. On Saturday, April , the agency says easy sightings of the crescent moon are likely across the world with the possible exceptions of southern and eastern Australia, New Zealand, and the north-eastern parts of Russia.Muslims in the UK and the rest of Europe, and in Africa, the Middle East and most of Asia will easily be able to see the crescent with the naked eye on Saturday, it said. Astronomers in Morocco have already said that they predict Ramadan will begin on Sunday, April .  They said they would not be able to observe the moon on Friday, so the current monthwould last one more day. Observations of the moon are not the same everywhere, due to the way it orbits the Earth. It can mean Islamic dates y by a day or two in dferent countries. There can also be discrepancies within the same country or even the same city,some Muslim communities fall in line with announcements from one overseas nation and some from another.

Al Lupiano, who attended Colonia High School, Woodbridge, told how he started to research the cases of the cancer and was shocked with the results. He himself had been diagnosed with the extremely rare cancer  years ago and when other family members also developed the disease, which affects the left side of the brain, he began to look into what was going on. He discovered that  sufferers had gone to his school. The environmental scientist said that he lost his sister to stage  glioblastoma who was diagnosed in August last year and two hours after that diagnosis his we also was told she had a primary brain tumour. It led to him putting a post on Facebook enquiringother Colonia High School children have suffered from tumours. What I find alarming is thereaposs truly only one environmental link to primary brain tumours and thataposs ionizing radiation. Itaposs not contaminated water. Itaposs not air. Itaposs not something in soil. Itaposs not something done to us due to bad habits, Mr Lupiano told CBS News.He is now working with local officials to find out what could have happened at the school that was built in , with materials used in the construction one theory put forward. It was virgin land. It was woods. The high school was the first thing to be there, so there was probably nothing in the ground at that time. The only thing that could have happened, potentially, was fill that was brought in during construction. We have no records  years ago, Woodbridge Mayor John McCormick said. The states department responsible for environmental protection has been contacted now to investigate. We are looking at possible things that we can do between the town and school, and they said they will look at anything we come up with, said Mr McCormick. Iaposm a lelong resident here. I raised my family here. So the health and safety of our students is of paramount importance to me.

And now he has revealed how to perfectly prepare your sausages in five easy-to-follow steps.With more than three decades of experience working in a professional kitchen as an award-winning Michelin-starred chef, Jeff knows his stuff, says the Daily Star, so take note.Heaposs even shared some of the most common errors home cooks make - and pricking the sausages is a big no-no. For the perfect sausages, Jeff recommends cooking them as follows: For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. . Remove the sausages from the fridge  minutes before cooking. This helps the sausage to cook evenly and prevents the skin from splitting when it hits the heat. . Pop them into a heavy-based non-stick frying pan and place them on low to medium heat. . Add a teaspoon of duck or goose fat to the pan and swirl it around until the base is fully coated. Then tip away any excess fat. . Place the sausages in the pan, making sure they’re not touching each other and keep on constant heat. Turning them regularly ensures the bangers get a rich golden colour. Jeff recommends  to  minutes for a traditional thick sausage. . Rest the sausages before serving. Once the sausages are cooked, they will be firm to touch, with an internal temperature of °C. The secret now is to let the sausages rest for a few minutes, just like you would a steak allowing the meat to relax, giving you a tender, juicy sausage. Common mistakes Jeff also shared some of the most common mistakes people make when cooking sausages.The first is pricking the skins when cooking the sausages. This causes the juice to run out, meaning youaposll be left with a dry, tasteless sausage. He also urges people never to deep fry their sausages as this can also dry them out. And finally, baking your sausages - although this may seem like the healthiest option - doing so prevents the exterior from crisping up.

She went on to say how sheaposs had a rocky relationship with her father and they went a number of years without speaking, so her initial reaction was one of surprise - All of this makes the fact that he asked so shocking. When he asked I gave an awkward chuckle and said, aposI donapost even knowI ever want to physically have a child myself andI do, I would probably use surrogacy myselfI could, you know apos He was audibly disappointed when he responded with, aposNo, I donapost knowapos. There was an awkward pause and I said, aposYeah well... sorry but I love youapos. And we hung up. I was so shocked I thought I had entered the twilight zone and started to feel nauseous. She recalled how much it weirded her out that her dad felt comfortable asking this of her. I would like her to put the fear of God into him so he never considers even THINKING of me and surrogacy in the same sentence ever again, she continued.My dad is a selfish person. I know he didnapost consider the ramications of what being pregnant and having a child would have on me at all - evenI would not be involved with raising it. I know part of why he asked is because he was hoping to save the money a surrogacy agency costs. Itaposs grossing me out that he had to have thought about me being pregnant. Iaposd like to talk to my mum about this. She concluded her post by asking whether she should talk to her mother about it despite being told to keep it to herself or try to keep it together knowing she would have to confront her dad about it at some point. Reddit users were quick to share their thoughts on her situation, and many encouraged her to speak to her mum. One person said: Iaposm usually in the camp of donapost spill secrets, but this is a huge ask andyou need to confide in your mum, confide in her. Itaposs something that majorly affects you. If it eases your mind, you wouldnapost even qualy to be a surrogate. No legit fertility place will allow you to be impregnated, so his attempt to get around other fees would fail. Even the places with the loosest restrictions wouldnapost accept a surrogate that has never carried at least one pregnancy to term. Itaposs the most major of requirements.The original poster thanked them and said: That does ease my mind! I didnapost know that at all. Clearly, his time spent thinking about asking me was not spent wisely enough! Another person wrote: Can you imagine telling people you’re carrying your dadaposs baby  to which the woman replied saying: Right!  How would I explain that to literally anybody  A third added: If heaposs prepared to ask you to be his surrogate, he has to ALSO be prepared that people are going to find out about it.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the unnamed woman wrote: She kept insinuating things throughout the whole lunch, saying, aposI can teach you some cooking, it is a bad omen to make your husband cookapos.

We’d be watching a film and he’d just burst into tears for no reason. I’d ask him what the problem was, but he’d just ignore me. Then, when we got together, he started saying stuff like ‘this is the stage of the relationship when everything starts going wrong’.  We’d only been seeing each other a matter of weeks! It was so confusing, I couldn’t understand why he was being so intense and needy. Alisha messaged Jordan to tell him their fling was off. He blocked me and that was it, she says. The next morning I went to work for am and didn’t get home until pm. I knew something was wrong as soon as I walked in the hallway - I usually leave all the interior doors open, but someone had closed them all.  I opened my living room door and just burst into tears at the sight in front of me. He’d pulled my shoes out of the little cloakroom and poured beans and spaghetti in there. There were condiments splattered all over the walls and cooking sauce poured all over my vacuum cleaner. Still sobbing, Alisha walked through to her kitchen where she found brand new appliances had had their cables cut through. In her bedroom, Alisha found her make-up trashed, shower gel poured in her drawers, plus more appliances and phone chargers with severed cables.  The bathroom was strewn with red bubble bath and a shoe had been chucked down the toilet.” Alisha called her mum in floods of tears. I couldn’t even speak, she recalls. Mum had to call the police for me because I couldn’t get my words out. Officers arrived within hours and Alisha moved out to stay with a relative until a forensic team had examined her flat.

Meanwhile, Alisha spent a day and a half cleaning up her trashed flat with the help of a relative. She had to repaint the living room, kitchen and bathroom and needed professionals to clean her carpets, and while she was able to repair the cut cables to some of her appliances, others had to be binned. The damage caused by Jordan’s wrecking spree was estimated at almost £,. It was heartbreaking, she says. It took months before I felt safe again. Alisha deleted Tinder after Jordan’s rampage and has since met someone new. Jordan appeared at Ipswich Crown Court in January after previously pleading guilty to criminal damage and one count of burglary after he took a necklace that he had given Alisha on her birthday. He got a two-year community order, with  rehabilitation activity days and  hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay Alisha £, in compensation and £ in court costs, and was given a five-year restraining order.

The -year-old is now convinced the German paedophile took the three-year-old British girl in May  at Praia da Luz on the Algarve. And Post claimed Brueckner boasted of burgling holiday flats during chilling “night-crawls” across the Portuguese resort. He told how the chief suspect in Madeleine’s disappearance had up to  passports from ­properties he raided. And he admitted he regrets not tipping off police about his crimes, but insisted he is willing to try to help bring him to justice over the missing toddler.German Post, a talented musician and IT expert, became friends with Brueckner, , after the pair met in an Algarve bar in the early-s. He initially believed his fellow ­countryman could not have been behind Madeleine’s kidnap and thought his criminality was limited to burglary. But since discovering Brueckner had been convicted of child sex offences in his teens, Post said it was now “so obvious” he snatched her. He added: “Now I know about his paedophile past, his rapist past. I’m % certain it was him. “I think he found her by chance and just took her on the spur of the moment. “I think once you are a paedophile, there is a switch in your brain that cannot be turned off. If he saw a little girl asleep, alone in her apartment, he would definitely have taken her. “Thinking about what he has done in the past makes me sick, it makes me want to vomit knowing I was hanging with him. If he is convicted of taking Madeleine I hope they lock him up and take away the key.”Post was tracked down by the Mirror to a small town in southern Cambodia where he lives under an assumed name. In his first ever interview he told how he and Brueckner would go to each other’s flats after they became friends. Post said he knew his new pal was on the “fringes” of crime but had no idea of the true scale until a later visit to his ramshackle farmhouse. He said: “I was sat in the living room and noticed piles of passports on the fireplace. There honestly must have been between  and  of them, neatly stacked up in three piles. “He told me he got them on his ‘­night-crawls’ in Praia da Luz, climbing onto balconies and through windows. It shows how many burglaries he must have done. “He said he would go into rooms and take what he wanted. At the time I guessed he was talking about cash, jewellery, ­passports… but now who knows  “He would only do it at night, it was too risky being seen in the daylight.  “He also said he was trafficking a bit of weed to make cash. But there was absolutely no sign he was into children or anything like sexual crimes. “Do I have regrets not telling the police about the passports at the time  I guess I do. “But now I’m willing to go back to court, to face him again, and help convict himthey want me to.” Post only discovered Brueckner had been convicted of child sex offences after reading about them in the press. And we can reveal he has twice been interviewed by detectives investigating the suspect and Madeleine’s case. Post also gave evidence against him at his  trial for raping a pensioner in Praia da Luz in , for which he is serving seven years in Germany. He fell out with Brueckner in  after the crook asked him to go to his house and clear out anything ­incriminating while he was in a Portimao prison for stealing petrol.  Post found some porn films and binned them rather than take them to a friend’s house who had children. He said: “He thought I was stealing from him or something.” The pair met briefly again in  after Post had ed to Germany to work on a Christmas market in Solingen near Dusseldorf. But after moving to Cambodia in , he was stunned when his brother rang three years later to say German detectives wanted to speak to him. Post added: “They said he was a suspect in the Madeleine case. I was absolutely shocked.” He said he had never spoken about Brueckner publicly before over fears he would be linked to the Madeleine case. And he insisted he had nothing to do with any of the suspect’s crimes. German prosecutors named Brueckner as a suspect in June  and claim to have evidence he abducted and killed her. He denies any involvement in the case. Madeleine’s parents Kate, , and Gerry, , from Rothley, Leics, continue to believe she is alive somewhere. Last week it was reported Home Office funding for Scotland Yard’s Operation Grange investigation into the disappearance will end this year. The probe, opened in , has so far cost more than £million.

Sanctioned Alexei Mordashov’s  million floating palace Nord took cover in Vlaostok after he feared it would be seized in the Seychelles.Normally Moscow’s Billionaire Set ply the waters of more exotic locations, and the sight of the ft Nord has stunned locals in Russia ’s Pacic capital.They are rushing to take selfies with the elite vessel, and customs officers who inspected the ship on arrival in port. They were escorted around the ship by one of the crew, wearing shorts. The video shows how well -year-old oligarch Mordashov - worth . billion according to Forbes - has done since he graduated from Northumbria University in England.  We can see the interiors of several decks, Toyota Land Cruiser Prado cars, all-terrain vehicles, jet skis, motor boats, and a bathyscaphe,” said one local media account. On a tour of the ship, a customs officer looks inside the -star facilities and says: “Business class room.” The crew member corrects him saying: First class”. A customs man inspects one of several drinks cabinets, and comments disapprovingly: “No Russian vodka.”  The oligarch’s study was shown, and a shower room and pantry. Mordashov is the main owner of Severstal, Russia’s largest steel and mining company. Due to the video, the smart interior of the ocean-going yacht with its own swimming pool has been exposed for all to see. “This is how the wealthy live even when they’re sanctioned,” said one comment. “Mordashov won’t get any sympathy here.”  Andrey Prokopchuk, a trade unionist, said: Previously, serious guys used to tattoo the word ‘North’ [Nord] on their arms.” It meant they had served time in a jail in Siberia or the Arctic. “Today our serious boys have changed and named their mega-yachts like this.” Others were more sympathetic. I am amazed at the ingenuity of the owner of this beauty,” said Yulia Ivanova.  “To sail this work of art for  days to its native land.” The yacht costs  million to run but it remains out of reach of Western countries while in Russian waters. Another Mordashov yacht worth  million and property worth  million was seized in Italy due to EU sanctions. I have absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension and I do not understand why the EU has imposed sanctions on me,” he told Russian state news agency TASS. Nord sails under a Cayman Islands flag. Mordashov is the richest sanctioned person in Russia where half of its people have not been sanctioned over the war in Ukraine, according to Forbes.The businessman is the man shareholder of steel company Severstal and also owns a stake in TUI Group. Mordashov was until recently the richest man in Russia. This is now Vladimir Potanin, , the biggest shareholder in MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC, who has not been subjected to international sanctions.

Rather than looking at who was at the table, we should look at on whose behalf they were there, he said.  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told broadcaster A Haber that Abramovich has been liaising between Kyiv and Moscow since the February  invasion and working sincerely to end the fighting. Of course, official talks are important, negotiations are important, but public opinion is sensitive, everyone wants to maintain their position, and there are channels that should be kept open between leaders and countries. Here, Abramovich plays a useful role, he said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had said Abramovich was not an official member of the Russian delegation, but acknowledged his presence to enable certain contacts. Reports said Abramovich even went to Kyiv on at least two occasions to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky But Abramovich’s critics claim he is using the talks to try and salvage his overseas assets. I’m not sure how much his involvement in this mediation is real and effective, and how much of it is a PR tool, Vladimir Ashurkov, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation founded by the jailed Russian dissident Alexei Navalny told the Financial Times. He’s a creative guy, and he has creative people working for him, so it can just be a way to have a chance to ease the sanctions. A member of the military alliance NATO, Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both and has offered to mediate.It has supported Kyiv, but also opposes sanctions on Moscow, including measures against Abramovich and other Russian billionaires. Abramovich had sought to sell his English soccer club Cha, a process taken out of his hands by the British government when it blacklisted him. Superyachts linked to him, together worth an estimated . billion, have been docked at Bodrum and Marmaris in southwest Turkey since last week.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mozart to jazz trio ecossaise delight ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Arts Associationwas delighted to welcome Trio Ecossaise as guest performers at Ardrishaig Public Hall for the fourth concert of the season.The impact of Covid has meant that many planned concerts had to be cancelled or dates changed so it was wonderful to have Trio Ecossaise perform on March .The concert opened with the Kegelstatt Trio by Mozart. Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

MWh mega-battery system mounted on an articulated electric lorry.The battery would plug into specially-constructed charging points connected to dedicated wind turbines, with charging taking  hours.Fully-loaded, the mobile unit would travel to designated points around Argyll and Bute, allowing up to  cars to charge at any time, and around  in total before heading back for a top-up.Requiring simply a flatbed trailer, the transportation of the mega-battery is interesting Argyll hauliers, with some larger operators looking into purchasing electric tractor units specically for this job.With wind energy on tap # much of the time, at least # and locally produced, charging costs are expected to be signicantly lower than existing methods.A spokesperson for Argyll and Bute Council said: #The basic idea is that this simplies the charging process and broadens our options.#It will allow the council to better utilise electric vehicles, providing cost savings while saving the planet.#For residents and visitors, it will make planning journeys so much easier and stress-free, rather than wondering how far you will get before your battery runs out.#The rota for Flying Sparks has clearly yet to be finalised # though we expect it to very much utilise the same sites as mobile post offices and banks around the region.#A number of firms operating Argyll wind farms have expressed an interest, and a pilot scheme is expected to be in place by April , .Esisteinwitz Gesellschaft chief executive Olaf Prilo sees huge potential for the scheme. #You have wind to spare,# he said, #so why not use this directly, rather than sending electricity to the grid. Just roll up to the turbine, plug in and charge up the battery.#His firm is currently researching the development of the necessary equipment to enable clean, renewable energy to be utilised in vehicle charging.Mr Prilo concluded: #There is absolutely no reason why the Argyll and Bute region could not become the Saudi Arabia of electricity.#"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert harbour open day hailed a success","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe trustees of Tarbert Harbour Authority say they are #delighted# with the success of a recent community day to discuss proposed improvements to Tarbert.More than  people attended the community day, held at the Templar Arts and Leisure Centre on March , to learn about and discuss early thoughts on plans to improve the range of opportunities, services and facilities available to Tarbert residents and visitors.Towards the end of  Tarbert Harbour Authority secured funding of £, through the UK Government#s Communities Renewal Fund as part of the Levelling Up agenda.This allowed the authority to appoint consultants who, over six months, will investigate and develop several major projects throughout the harbour and Tarbert village.After the design phase the projects will be taken to a further funding stage, the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, andsuccessful work will start on projects to transform and rejuvenate the village, harbour and its environs.The project team includes Leith-based John Renshaw Architects Mott MacDonald, an international civil and marine engineering consultancy and ruralDimensions a Callander-based tourism consultancy.Team members were on hand on March  to discuss concepts in detail and to discuss pros and cons, having prepared a presentation on  potential initiatives including re-organisation of the Fish Quay, creating more public paths and developing the existing boatyard.Everyone who visited was encouraged to fill in an exit questionnaire highlighting what they liked, what concerned them and to highlight alternative opportunities.Duncan Cunningham, chair of the board of trustees of Tarbert Harbour Authority, said: #We are delighted that people have taken the time to come and see initial thoughts and ideas on how the harbour and village could develop.#As with all these consultations, there are strong views on what is and isn#t appropriate.#We were delighted to get a range of other interesting ideas that we will now consider.#The next step is for the team to reflect on the feedback we have received and to build this thinking into plans.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous. Duplicity#s original meaning in English has to do with a kind of deception in which true feelings or intentions are hidden behind  words or actions.I wouldn’t blame the children of South Sudanthey just gave up.One third are suffering chronic malnutrition. Half are missing school. Millions are displaced. And none of them have ever known anything but war.One of my colleagues there, a -year-old man, tells me he has never seen peace in his letime.

to writing their own material.As to the origins of the band’s name, Carl and Scott previously lived on the town’s Woodbush Court, with three-foot-wide Logan’s Close the quickest way to High Street.Carl said: “When we were thinking of what to call the band, the idea of making that close one day as famous as Abbey Road was pretty amusing to us, so we went with that.”The band had previously been looking forward to heading out to Germany but revealed they had run into an unexpected problem: the studio exploded.A huge bang destroyed much of the building in the early hours of the morning at the end of May last year.Carl, , said that the setback almost “scuppered” their plans but the studio equipment had now been moved to a new location.He added: “We are going to Hamburg to record the album because before the pandemic we did a wee tour there.“On our travels, we met a guy called Dennis Rux, who was saying he had got a studio with all the analogue vintage gear. My eyes lit up and I was already thinking that was cool.“We stayed in touch and it got to the stage where we thought maybe we should pursue this. We hit him up and askedhe would be up for doing the album and we worked it out and are going over there to do it.“We cannot wait.”Logan’s Close, who headlined the Dunbar Music Festival last year, created the Crowdfunder page in a bid to raise thousands of pounds to cover the cost of the album.People can make a donation of anywhere between £ and £, in exchange for a range of incentives, including a digital download of the finished album and a live concert.The band are working alongside Creative Scotland’s Crowdmatch programme, where the national body match-funds initiatives as the band reach funding milestones.Already, more than £, has been raised.Former Dunbar Grammar School pupil Carl described the sum raised as “unreal”.He said: “We have not been up to much in such a long time [due to the pandemic].“It is nice to think that after two years, people are still supporting us. It is great that solid rock foundation of support is still there and it is really reassuring.”Go to crowdfunder p logansclose to back the band."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-north-berwick-bird-lovers-organise-boycott","story":"On Monday, supermarket representatives met in a virtual meeting with community activists, representatives of the Scottish Seabird Centre and East Lothian MSP Paul McLennan, to outline alternatives to the existing netting, which was installed to discourage birds from nesting there.However, with no sign of a change of heart from Tesco, protesters are encouraging people around the town to boycott the North Berwick store.Carole Fairhurst, who started the original petition and helped organise the protest, said that the boycott was the only option after Tesco failed to respond to the public outcry.She said: “Tesco had assured us that they would look into alternatives, despite us wanting in the short term to have the netting removed, and they would come back on Wednesday, which was yesterday, with suggestions.“They failed to do so, they failed to engage with anyone who has tried to contact them, and so now the boycott is our next step.“The petition now has nearly , signatures, so there is a lot of support out there, obviously not all in North Berwick, but that just shows the strength of feeling that nature is being deprived on a daily basis on somewhere to live.”: Watch as protesters flock to Tesco in North BerwickThe nets were put up originally by Tesco as a hygiene measure to protect customers from bird droppings, but in doing so the supermarket removed and blocked off many house martin nests.The red-listed migratory bird s to the same nest each year, meaning Tesco’s preventative netting could be harmful to the future of the species.Images sent to the Courier have shown that birds have already become trapped in the supermarket’s netting, causing great trepidation over the house martins’ imminent .Angela Paterson, spokesperson for the campaign group, said: “It will just take one bird to die in those nets and they will be breaking the law and they will have complete community uproar on their hands.”RSPB Scotland also shared its concern about Tescos actions at the North Berwick store on social media. .

The second vessel will follow in early .: Embarrassment: Two CalMac ferries to be built in TurkeyCMAL says the new vessels will bring an almost % increase in vehicle and freight capacity on the Islay routes, a reduction in emissions and improve the resilience of the wider fleet.The decision to rubber stamp the contract came despite the move being described as an \"embarrassment\" for the SNP by the Scottish Conservatives.It also comes after CMAL were accused of acting unlawfully over the awarding of the key contract, which the ferry owners deny.It comes in the wake of concern that the nationalised shipbuilder Ferguson Marine failed to get a look in when it pitched for the contract to build two new vessels to serve Islay.The ground-breaking Procurement ReformAct  when it was brought in was seen by many as a welcome move away from contracts awarded only on the basis of the lowest price towards those which offer the best long-term outcomes for Scotland’s communities and the environment.The Cemre Marin Endustri shipyardPublic contracts valued at £m or above have specic requirements in relation to community benefits in the authority area that a contract is issued.These should include training and recruitment, the availability of sub-contracting opportunities, partnership arrangements, provision of parts and equipment and how it is intended to improve the economic, social or environmental well-being of the area.If no community benefits are sought in a contract, a statement must be published justying the decision.CMAL said that they had been \"committed to encouraging the provision of community benefits through their contracts\" and recognised a \"contractual requirement\" in relation to training and recruitment and availability of sub-contracting opportunities.Finance secretary Kate Forbes stated that in line with the Procurement ReformAct , bidders for the Islay procurement process were required to detail the community benefits they are able to offer within their response to the invitation to tender.Submissions from the four yards were being evaluated including the responses to the community benefits section included within the original contract notice.Mr McEleny who had been pushing for community benefit assurances expressed shock at what he called \"a holiday to Turkey\" was being used as a valuable community benefit.\"The abject failure of re-industrialising the Clyde has resulted in a lucrative contract to build Scottish ferries in Turkey.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

Federal labour officials said the results of the count will not be veried until they process any objections — due by April  — that both parties may file.Chris Smalls, a fired Amazon employee who has been leading the ALU in its fight on Staten Island, emerged from the NLRB building in Brooklyn on Friday with other union organisers, pumping their fists and jumping, chanting “ALU”.“I hope that everybody’s paying attention now because a lot of people doubted us,” he said.Mr Smalls hopes the success in New York will embolden workers at other facilities to launch their own organising campaigns. Even his group will soon sht their attention to a neighbouring Amazon warehouse on Staten Island, where a separate union election is scheduled to be held in late April.Amazon posted a statement on its company website on Friday saying that it was evaluating its options following the election.“We’re disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,” the post said.“We’re evaluating our options, including filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence by the NLRB that we and otherswitnessed in this election.”The company did not elaborate but it signalled it might challenge the election based on a lawsuit filed in March by the NLRB, which sought to force Amazon to reinstate a fired employee who was involved in the union drive. vw,vw,px, px\"The successful union effort on Staten Island stood in contrast to the one launched in Bessemer, Alabama NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado responded to Amazon’s statement by noting that the independent agency has been authorised by Congress to enforce the National Labour Relations Act.“All NLRB enforcement actions against Amazon have been consistent with that Congressional mandate,” she said.The successful union effort on Staten Island stood in contrast to the one launched in Bessemer, Alabama by the more established Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.Workers at an Amazon warehouse there appeared to have rejected a union bid but outstanding challenged ballots could change the outcome. The votes were -to- against the union. A hearing to review  challenged ballots is expected to begin in the next few days.Amazon has long been considered a top prize for the labour movement given the company’s massive size and impact. The results in Staten Island reverberated all the way to the White House.“The president was glad to see workers ensure their voices are heard with respect to important workplace decisions,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at Friday’s briefing about the vote.“He believes firmly that every worker in every state must have a free and fair choice to join a union and the right to bargain collectively with their employer.”"},{"url":null,"title":"line-duty-star-martin-compston-swaps-ac12-td1  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,” Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address to the nation.“There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.”He urged residents to wait to resume their normal lives until they are assured that the mines have been cleared and the danger of shelling has passed.While the Russians kept up their bombardment around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Ukrainian troops exploited the pullback on the ground by mounting counterattacks and retaking a number of towns and villages.Still, Ukraine and its allies warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating to promote trust at the bargaining table, as it claimed, but instead resupplying and shting its troops to the country’s east. Those movements appear to be preparation for an intensied assault on the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the country’s east, which includes Mariupol.Mr Zelensky warned of dficult battles ahead as the Russians redeploy troops. “We are preparing for an even more active defence,” he said.He did not say anything about the latest round of talks, which took place on Friday by video. At a round of talks earlier in the week, Ukraine said it would be willing to abandon a bid to join Nato and declare itself neutral – Moscow’s chief demand – infor security guarantees from several other countries.The invasion has left thousands dead and driven more than four million refugees from Ukraine.Elsewhere, at least three Russian ballistic missiles were fired late on Friday from the Crimean Peninsula at the Odesa region on the Black Sea, regional leader Maksim Marchenko said. The Ukrainian military said the Iskander missiles were intended for critical infrastructure but did not hit their targets because of Ukraine’s air-defence forces. It was unclear where they hit.Mr Marchenko said there were casualties, but he did not elaborate. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Zelensky warned of dficult battles ahead as the Russians redeploy troops Odesa is Ukraine’s largest port and the headquarters of its navy.As for the fuel depot explosion, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said two Ukrainian helicopter gunships flew in extremely low and attacked the civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of the city of Belgorod, about  miles from the Ukraine border.The regional governor said two workers at the depot were wounded, but the Rosneft state oil company denied anyone was hurt.Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, said on Ukrainian television: “For some reason they say that we did it, but in fact this does not correspond with reality.”In an interview with Fox, Mr Zelensky refused to say whether Ukraine launched the attack.Amid the Russian pullback on the ground and its continued bombardment, Ukraine’s military said it had retaken  settlements in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions."},{"url":null,"title":"wintry-weather-way-first-weekend-april  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas meterwill see costs increase by around pound per year to pound,. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

The SDLP#s MP for the area, Claire Hanna, who romped home in the last general election with some , votes, around , more than the nearest candidate — expressed her shock at the turn of events. The constituency is also larger than East and West Belfast and is the most erse of all NI#s electoral areas, ing MLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens. There is a term for this move by Sinn Fein we are all too familiar with: gerrymandering.What is most curious about this move is that, back in , proposed changes to electoral boundaries here that would seemingly have favoured the DUP were branded “gerrymandering to placate” Northern Ireland#s largest unionist party by Sinn Fein. This criticism was not voiced by one Sinn Fein representative or party spokesperson at the time, but at least half a dozen, in what was essentially a media blitz in a bid to put a spanner in the proposals.What is even more curious is that press statements on Sinn Fein#s website referring to said gerrymandering have vanished. If you simply google “Sinn Fein on gerrymandering” and click on any of the ious links which previously directed to statements from Conor Murphy, Colm Gildernew, Francie Molloy and others on the Sinn Fein website, you are greeted with the following  error message, reading: “We#re sorry, but the page you requested could not be found on our servers. We may have recently moved, renamed, or deleted certain pages.”It seems, much like the party#s previous stance on Russia, they are simply trying to avoid accusations of double standards and prone to extreme stance-switching when it suits them.Read MoreSinn Fein defend proposals to redraw Belfast’s electoral boundariesAn April Fool’s wish listDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ah, April Fool#s Day. Given the state of world at the minute — war in Europe, the cost of living crisis on the tail end of a pandemic that hasn#t gone away - I was hoping we would give it a rest this year, lest we cause more unneeded distress. One humorous political wish list, however, was posted on Twitter by human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights , reading: “‘Stick your hostile environment’ — Givan tells UK Home Office. ‘Mackies will be % social’ — Hargey takes action on housing rights. ‘Our policies are the problem, not you’ — Swann promises counsellors in every GP practice.” We can but dream.NI#s most unambiguous partyAn interesting press statement was released by the TUV on Friday, which declared that the party#s designation on the ballot paper for May#s poll will read: ‘TUV — No Sea Border’.Explaining the move, TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Having led where others have followed we wish every voter to see the issue identied without ambiguity on the ballot paper. There will be no doubt as to what a vote for TUV means.”Now, the TUV have been accused of being many things, but ‘ambiguous’ is definitely not one of them. Anyone with even a slight grasp of Northern Ireland politics could probably predict the party’s stance on any given issue before Jim Allister’s party has voiced its opinion. So this just seems like a needless waste of ink. I doubt anyone was going to be mistaken that they were actually voting for a bunch of liberal Europhiles.Related topicsSinn FéinSDLPConor MurphyClaire HannaMore On Sinn FéinDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border poll PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSinn Fein slammed for election launch at Belfast’s Europa Hotel which was repeatedly bombed by IRACriticism as Electric Ireland customers facing nearly £ rise in annual billsMost ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayRoy Reynolds: Co Antrim murder victim suffered ‘barbaric injuries’, court toldHow Northern Ireland skyer survived crashing to earth from ,ft and hitting ground at mph‘My baby would still be aliveI’d got proper care at Lagan Valley Hospital’: Grieving mum speaks outTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayHarry Styles shares message of support for the people of UkrainePlayVideo: *Graphic content* Iraqi soldiers reportedly executed by ISISLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Northern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeBusinesses need to make their voices heard on protocol benefits, SDLP MP saysLatestAmazon workers in NYC vote to unioniseGareth Southgate expects ‘tricky’ World Cup ties despite favourable England drawWhat the papers say – April Miley Cyrus says catching Covid- on world tour was ‘definitely worth it’Two veterans who fought in Falklands meet  years on from war,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit :Sinn FeinGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has questioned the use of the Europa Hotel as the setting for Sinn Fein’s election launch, saying it’s a venue the Provisional IRA “systematically bombed”.On Tuesday, Michelle O’Neill gave a speech at the Great Victoria Street hotel, which was bombed  times during the Troubles.She outlined Sinn Fein’s priorities ahead of the upcoming election including the cost of living crisis and “fiercely defending” the Good Friday Agreement.“The facts are that the balance of power at Stormont has shted irreversibly and political unionism must come to terms with the fact the world is moving on fast,” Ms O’Neill said.“So, while the DUP and the TUV are trying to take us backwards, our message is clear, we are only moving forward.”Commenting on the choice of venue, Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United said: Sinn Fein clearly don#t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe is brazen to say the least.However, due to the intensity of the Provisional IRA#s bombing campaign — and that of other terrorists, few hotel venues across Northern Ireland have come away unscathed by the Troubles.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up TUV South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin said Sinn Fein’s campaign launch at the Europa was a “grotesque spectacle” given the setting.“Here we had the political wing of the terrorist organisation which repeatedly bombed the hotel in which they met daring to ponticate about democracy and respecting the will of the people.“There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein First Minister upon Northern Ireland.“The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Yet just weeks out from the election both the DUP and UUP are dodging this vital question.Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O#Neill  Why is there reluctance to be open and honest with the public on this point ”The DUP#s Gordon Lyons said Sinn Fein#s election launch demonstrates their priority lies on holding a border poll rather than on helping families or rebuilding Northern Ireland’s economy.The party#s director of elections said: Sinn Fein#s rally was a show of strength for a border poll.“Whilst the DUP has a five-point plan to build a better future for Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein wants to win the election to implement their plan for a border poll.“There is a clear choice on offer to people whether they want a future focused on fixing our health system, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the protocol, or one fixated on a isive border poll.“When Michelle O#Neill talks about making history, we know it isn#t record levels of investment into our hospitals she is referring to. Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn FéinDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border pollAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatCriticism as Electric Ireland customers facing nearly £ rise in annual billsMost ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayRoy Reynolds: Co Antrim murder victim suffered ‘barbaric injuries’, court toldHow Northern Ireland skyer survived crashing to earth from ,ft and hitting ground at mph‘My baby would still be aliveI’d got proper care at Lagan Valley Hospital’: Grieving mum speaks outTop VideosPlayHarry Styles shares message of support for the people of UkrainePlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayVideo: *Graphic content* Iraqi soldiers reportedly executed by ISISLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestAmazon workers in NYC vote to unioniseGareth Southgate expects ‘tricky’ World Cup ties despite favourable England drawWhat the papers say – April Miley Cyrus says catching Covid- on world tour was ‘definitely worth it’Two veterans who fought in Falklands meet  years on from war,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Brian Lawless PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UUP manesto has enough meat to show that the party is starting to think seriously about being a major player in the Executive once more, and enough bare bones to reveal that the process is incomplete.At , words, this document is serious in its scope and suffused with the liberal unionist tone of new leader Doug Beattie.But it is what this manesto does not say which reveals most: hard choices or unpopular proposals are either absent or presented in oblique terms — and that jars with Mr Beattie’s straight-talking style.Health is the first and the iest section — unsurprisingly, given that polling has shown Robin Swann to be Stormont’s most popular minister.The manesto indicates support for radical measures, saying that the pandemic has shown that both patients and medics are willing “to travel longer distancesit means receiving care and support in a more timely manner. It is essential that the opportunities currently before us are not lost”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreNo united Ireland for generations to come, UUP leader insistsAndrew Madden:OpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeThat seems to hint at support for implementing the decades of reports which say Northern Ireland has too many small hospitals, some of which need to be closed or downgraded to centralise expertise in centres of excellence.But the UUP is not explicit about this.There are other hints of centralising services — “a regionally consistent approach to cancer services across Northern Ireland” with “regional pathways and rapid diagnostic clinics”.The party also proposes greater evening and weekend use of theatres, but hints at the cost by saying it will mean “properly incentivising the move towards a genuine seven day a week health service”.Signicantly, the party says it would ban the use of contract agency workers — but only “once the immediate HSC pressures subside” .Health trusts are sharply criticised, with the UUP saying that for too long “sub-optimal trust performances [have been] tolerated”, something which suggests frustration at what Mr Swann has seen within the system.His solution is a new operationally independent HSC chief executive accountable to a board with political, professional and civic society membership, similar to the Policing Board.On the NI Protocol, the UUP says that “unionists cannot accept an internal border within the United Kingdom. There can be no border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.That simple commitment seems to prevent the UUP signing up to any revised protocol involving an Irish Sea border.Its tone is dferent to the DUP, talking about wanting to “maintain good relations with the EU”, but the content is similar to that of the ERG — pushing mutual enforcement, with a new north-south body to oversee this. A requirement to label GB goods coming into NI “for UK sale only” would only avoid a new Irish Sea borderit was enforced for all UK products.The party would ban gay conversion therapy, establish a gambling regulator, allocate overdue investment to football stadia, and examine letting private garages do MoT tests.The party opposes a Troubles amnesty and robustly says paramilitaries “need to be put out of business permanently” by focussing on their leaderships and criminal assets. It wants to curb legal aid, due to “the culture of lawfare which has been allowed to develop within our legal system and which has proved extremely lucrative for a number of firms”.The manesto is laden with more spending — new train stops, new busses, new roads, more rates relief for some businesses, spending on city deals,  more police officers, and looking at giving everyone in primary school a free meal.How this would be paid for is unclear. There is no talk of increasing rates. Water charges are ruled out. And giving Stormont more tax powers is also rejected. Changing the status of NI Waterand the Housing Executive to allow them to borrow is about as far as funding proposals go.This is a detailed document, yet many of the proposals are all things to all people – it is pro-business, but also pro-worker pro-grammar schools, but looking to review how academic selection operates, pro-EU, but anti-protocol.None of those things are necessarily contradictory, but in not being clearer about some of the most controversial or unpopular areas, the party is putting off having to take those decisions until after they’ve got the votes.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannNI ProtocolMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudge PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idleCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body find PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismMost ReadSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayRoy Reynolds: Co Antrim murder victim suffered ‘barbaric injuries’, court toldHow Northern Ireland skyer survived crashing to earth from ,ft and hitting ground at mph‘My baby would still be aliveI’d got proper care at Lagan Valley Hospital’: Grieving mum speaks outTop VideosPlayHarry Styles shares message of support for the people of UkrainePlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayVideo: *Graphic content* Iraqi soldiers reportedly executed by ISISLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeBusinesses need to make their voices heard on protocol benefits, SDLP MP saysLatestAmazon workers in NYC vote to unioniseGareth Southgate expects ‘tricky’ World Cup ties despite favourable England drawWhat the papers say – April Miley Cyrus says catching Covid- on world tour was ‘definitely worth it’Two veterans who fought in Falklands meet  years on from war,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurneySuzanne BreenTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSDLP MP Claire Hanna has spoken of her shock at a Sinn Fein proposal to abolish the constituency of South Belfast.In a submission to the Boundary Commission, the party proposes the constituency is axed with its voters largely ided between two other constituencies — despite South Belfast having more voters than either East or West Belfast.Ms Hanna said Sinn Fein’s proposal “does not make any mathematical sense” and that residents would be stunned it was seeking to abolish Northern Ireland’s most politically erse constituency.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.South Belfast currently is the only constituency toMLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens.Ms Hanna said: “Each of Belfast’s four constituencies has a distinct identity, community cohesion, and things they are proud of. South Belfast has for decades been known as a erse, integrated part of the city where people of all political views and none live side-by-side.“Many people chose to settle in South Belfast precisely because of that. This constituency is, and always has been, a shared space.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “It is pluralist in its politics and values, and I think residents would be very disconcerted and concerned at a proposal to break it up and to parcel bits off into other constituencies.”Read MoreTalks need to begin over scrapping mandatory coalition, says Arlene FosterThe rules for the  Boundary Commission review mean each constituency must have an electorate of between , and ,.North Belfastand South Belfastfall within the target range. West Belfastand East Belfastdo not.Ms Hanna lodged her objections to Sinn Fein’s proposal at a meeting with the Boundary Commission last month.“West and East Belfast are below the statutory electoral range by , and , voters respectively,” she said.“The high level of house-building in South Belfast, particularly in the Four Winds and Malone, together with the council’s determination to repopulate the city core, means the number of electors in South Belfast is going to rise further within a parliamentary term.“The Boundary Commission was happy for Northern Ireland to keep all its  seats. In previous proposals in , which were dropped, it had wanted to reduce to  seats, so somewhere would have had to take the fall.“Sinn Fein’s proposal is even more surprising when the Boundary Commission isn’t even looking to lose a seat.”Under Sinn Fein’s plan, Belfast would be reduced from four constituencies to three.East Belfast would remain, absorbing parts of South Belfast, and two new constituencies would be created — North West Belfast and South West Belfast.Ormeau, Rosetta, and Ravenhill would be moved into East Belfast. Malone, Stranmillis, and Finaghy would be put into the new South West Belfast constituency.Demographic trends suggest Sinn Fein would secure both the South West and North West Belfast seats at a Westminster election, with the SDLP losing out. The influx of South Belfast voters to the east of the city would help Alliance unseat the DUP there.In its submission to the Boundary Commission, Michelle O’Neill’s party says: “Sinn Fein believe that too much emphasis is placed in trying to keep Belfast as four-seater constituency which comes at the detriment to the rest of the constituencies.”Under the Boundary Commission’s plan, South Belfast remains largely intact, but gains the rural wards of Drumbo, Saintfield, and Moneyreagh to become South Belfast and Mid Down. Strangford would be renamed Strangford and Quoile.Professor Jon Tonge of the University of Liverpool said the commission’s proposed boundary changes were “fairly minimalist”.“Fermanagh and South Tyrone — very marginal — becomes fractionally more nationalist, which will please Sinn Fein.

They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed.Volodymyr ZelenskyRussia continued withdrawing some of its ground forces from areas around Kyiv after saying earlier this week it would reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital and the northern city of Chernihiv.“They are mining the whole territory. They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,” Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address to the nation.“There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He urged residents to wait to resume their normal lives until they are assured that the mines have been cleared and the danger of shelling has passed.While the Russians kept up their bombardment around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Ukrainian troops exploited the pullback on the ground by mounting counterattacks and retaking a number of towns and villages.Still, Ukraine and its allies warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating to promote trust at the bargaining table, as it claimed, but instead resupplying and shting its troops to the country’s east. Those movements appear to be preparation for an intensied assault on the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the country’s east, which includes Mariupol.Mr Zelensky warned of dficult battles ahead as the Russians redeploy troops. “We are preparing for an even more active defence,” he said.He did not say anything about the latest round of talks, which took place on Friday by video. At a round of talks earlier in the week, Ukraine said it would be willing to abandon a bid to join Nato and declare itself neutral – Moscow’s chief demand – infor security guarantees from several other countries.The invasion has left thousands dead and driven more than four million refugees from Ukraine.Elsewhere, at least three Russian ballistic missiles were fired late on Friday from the Crimean Peninsula at the Odesa region on the Black Sea, regional leader Maksim Marchenko said. The Ukrainian military said the Iskander missiles were intended for critical infrastructure but did not hit their targets because of Ukraine’s air-defence forces.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, it has been revealed this week.South Down MP Mr Eddie McGrady said he has been informed of the commitment of the Department of Education to a new school in the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead and his predecessor as Education Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney.ldquoThe school definitely requires additional accommodation and I am keen that is is provided on the existing site, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August

Since then, the organisation has grown and the level of support we provided has widened considerably, Linda revealed.ldquoWe now have a team of  volunteers who are in contact with  people across the district. Despite the global pandemic, we continued to deliver the service from our homes with the calls even more appreciated by clients who could not go out themselves.Linda said that during the pandemic, the volunteers made an additional  calls to people, such was the need of elderly and vulnerable people across the community.ldquoWe started off calling people for a little friendly chat but the service we provided started to evolve. While chatting with clients remains at the heart of what we do to support those who are isolated, we now find ourselves helping people with a range of complex needs.ldquoThe charityrsquos work has evolved and I suppose it will continue to in the future, but Good Morningrsquos Down core principle will always remain the same.Linda paid tribute to all the charityrsquos staff and those who have supported the organisation over many years.ldquoWe are like family and I will be sorry to leave, she said. ldquoI have spent a large part of my working le with Good Morning Down and have literally lived and breathed the organisation and have been assisted by great people.Linda said it was ldquotremendous to meet clients when the charity organised its get-togethers and while these were put on hold due to the pandemic, she hopes there may be an opportunity do something before the end of the year.ldquoThat of course will be guided by the public health situation at the time as we are mindful that our clients are elderly, with a number of them also vulnerable.Linda said the charityrsquos service has never been more important and while she is leaving the organisation, she knows it will continue to be a key part of peoplersquos lives.She added: ldquoI really enjoyed my time with Good Morning Down and worked alongside really great people. They were the friendly voice at the end of the telephone who helped make a dference to peoplersquos lives.ldquoFor many, their chat with our volunteers was the only interaction they would have with others during the day and we were always conscious of that. We worked to make a dference and you build a special relationship with clients which is why it was so wonderful to see them when we all did meet up.As Linda prepares to say her final goodbyes, Good Morning Down is looking for someone to replace her at the helm of the charity.Anyone keen to take on taking on her role or interested in getting involved in the work of Good Morning Down is asked to contact her on    or email lindabakergmd@yahoo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"History project looks back at  Jewish family’s links to Shrigley  ","story":"THE remarkable contribution of Jewish families in saving Shrigley has been recalled in a unique history project.The story of how Jews, fleeing the Holocaust and Hitlers murderous purge in Europe, started arriving in the village just before the start of the Second World War and helped transform the fortunes of villagers after the Hungry Thirties is largely forgotten.But more than  years later, Shrigleys legacy is featuring in an on-line interactive map telling the stories of Jewish families who have left a lasting impact on Northern Ireland.Steven Jaffe has been researching the heritage of the Jewish community across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe goal of the Belfast Jewish Heritage project Shared History fund is to locate, preserve, document and make publicly available material relating to the Jewish community in Northern Ireland, said Mr Jaffe.ldquoIt shows  sites across Northern Ireland, including Shrigley, Saintfield and Downpatrick.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

It has also generated an estimated £ million for the Northern Ireland Economy in that period.By a benign coincidence it was announced on Thursday that this summer a record  cruise ships will dock in Belfast bringing a much welcomed post-Covid wave of mass tourist spending across the Province.The waters through which the Titanic was launched and that HMS Caroline sped through to fight that decisive naval battle were in the th century the pathway circuits by which Belfast’s industrial revolution was turbocharged. In the st century these circuits are flowing back in the opposite direction, pulling millions upon millions of tourist-driven pounds into Northern Ireland’s economic heart, boosting expenditure and creating jobs after the devastation of the Pandemic. The city’s sea faring tradition both naval and merchant over the centuries is not only one to be proud of but also to take hope from. Belfast rose up around its lough and the Lagan. The news about Titanic Belfast’s first outstanding decade, the cruise ships , the salvation of HMS Caroline remind us of the regenerative power of the city’s waterway to the world.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But when it comes to casting their ballots, up to % of people who go have hitherto gone to the polls in NI elections have voted for political parties who are primarily identied by their stance on the constitutional question.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Even in recent elections the non-aligned centre ground, despite having surged , are doing well to get more than % of the votes.Do not be fooled by anyone who says that the protocol is only of importance to unionists, and that even many unionists do not care. Many of the people who make this point themselves care very much about the Irish Sea border — they want to keep it, either because they support staying in the EU , or because they see it as major step towards an economic united Ireland, and thus towards a more general all-Ireland.It is true that many of the more apolitical unionists are much more relaxed about the protocol than they should be, but that is typically because it is complex .It is also because such unionists heard that the protocol offered the best of both worlds .Thus unionists should have been, and should still be, trying to explain and reiterate to some of the more apathetic pro Union voters the ultimate impact of the NI Protocol. This would entail trying to revive some of the spirit of indignation that there was in the early months of , when many people across the Province were suddenly finding that they could not get deliveries from Great Britain that they had always been able to get before.The EU has been keen to agree to case-by-case exemptions to checks in part because it does not want the wider public to be troubled by the protocol. Needless to say, therefore, unionists badly need to see a large vote for parties that oppose the protocol.Doug Beattie’s approach to the Irish Sea border, of opposing it but calling for engagement in the pursuit of political solutions to the problems that it creates, has a high-wire quality. If the Alliance vote goes down, even slightly, on recent elections, and the Ulster Unionist Party vote increases, Mr Beattie will be able to say that his tactics have stemmed the decline of unionism by broadening its appeal.If Alliance continues upwards, and the UUP does not rise, he will be seen to have not only been weak on the protocol, but having failed to win over moderates in the process.l The second key thing to watch out for in the election is turnoutThere was a time in the s and early s when it seemed voters in the western world were losing interest in politics.Countries such as the UK and United States were increasingly wealthy and many bitter political disagreements of the s and s seemed to give way to a more bland, moderate politics. In Northern Ireland itself, this wider trend towards consensus seemed to be reflected in the  Belfast Agreement. But this sense of stable politics has evaporated, at home and abroad. There are now bitter ides on major issues of national and global importance, and much turbulence in voting patterns.The Brexit referendum of  had a higher turnoutthan most recent UK general elections have done.The Scottish independence plebiscite in  had an even higher turnout .The fiercely contested, and narrowly decided, US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in November  had one of the highest turnouts of any presidential race in modern memory .In Northern Ireland, the turnout surged from % of voters in the  Stormont election to % a year later, in the more fraught atmosphere of the election after Sinn Fein collapsed the institutions.There is now keen interest in conflicts and politics at home and abroad. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, I feared people in the UK would not care much, seeing it as a distant problem. I was relieved to be proven wrong by the massive interest there was in such a serious global matter.A high turnout next month would show that the population in NI still think that Stormont and issues such as the protocol matter.l The final thing to watch is the vote shares of the two communitiesWill it be like the  general election, when the DUP and Sinn Fein dominated thingsor like  when they plunged to a combined % Will unionists get a combined vote share in the high s %, as in the  and  Stormont elections, or will they be down round %, as in  Westminster  Will nationalists combined get more than % of the vote, as they have done in some elections, or go back under that level It will be a bad day indeed for unionismthe combined vote is as low as %, as some polls have suggested, or even in the high s.ProtocolNorthern IrelandDoug BeattieBen LowryIrish Sea  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularRamadan : What is Ramadan  Ramadan dates  - and how to wish someone a happy RamadanIt’s nationalist Brit-bashing that really fuels sectarianism – not BrexiteersAll Translink bus services to be ‘paralysed’ as drivers vote for industrial action over pay, union announcesNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsAnti-protocol rally: we want an apology from Doug Beattie – not a meetingMost PopularBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and SnugpakBest Aldi dupes : top perfume, skincare, beauty, makeup, cleansing balm products from Lacura to le CreusetBest patio heaters UK : weatherproof electric heaters and coal firepits, from Made, Wayfair, ConranRod Stewart tour : when tickets go on sale for extra UK dates - including London, Glasgow and BirminghamBest head torches UK : bright, reliable head torches for camping, hiking, and mountaineering                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann says that testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to COVID- over the coming months but that a “more targeted approach” will be introduced on a phased basis from April, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness.Under the new policy, PCR testing in NI will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop Covid symptoms.Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting, such as a care home, until the end of June, with a further review then.The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced in Northern Ireland until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June.The full range of changes to take effect from  April in Northern Ireland are as follows-* PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.* Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.* Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.* Routine asymptomatic testing - testing for those with no symptoms - will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.* Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.* Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.* Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.* Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .* Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.”The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Continue with six weeks holiday in the summer at least! We get the shortest summer break in the world. State should provide free affordable childcare.”Trena Wise said: “Four weeks would be better and spread the rest throughout the year.” This was agreed with by Lisa Gerrard.Trudi Thomas said: “Five weeks and an extra week off at Christmas.”Iulia Condurache said: “These kids need this.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWarehouse workers cast , votes — or about % — in favour of a union, giving the fledgling Amazon Labor Union enough support to pull off a victory.According to the National Labor Relations Board, which is overseeing the process, , workers — or % — rejected the union bid.The  ballots that were challenged by either Amazon or the ALU were not enough to sway the outcome. Federal labour officials said the results of the count will not be veried until they process any objections — due by April  — that both parties may file.Chris Smalls, a fired Amazon employee who has been leading the ALU in its fight on Staten Island, emerged from the NLRB building in Brooklyn on Friday with other union organisers, pumping their fists and jumping, chanting “ALU”.“I hope that everybody’s paying attention now because a lot of people doubted us,” he said.Mr Smalls hopes the success in New York will embolden workers at other facilities to launch their own organising campaigns. Even his group will soon sht their attention to a neighbouring Amazon warehouse on Staten Island, where a separate union election is scheduled to be held in late April.Amazon posted a statement on its company website on Friday saying that it was evaluating its options following the election.“We’re disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,” the post said.“We’re evaluating our options, including filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence by the NLRB that we and otherswitnessed in this election.”The company did not elaborate but it signalled it might challenge the election based on a lawsuit filed in March by the NLRB, which sought to force Amazon to reinstate a fired employee who was involved in the union drive..remove vw,vw,px, px\"The successful union effort on Staten Island stood in contrast to the one launched in Bessemer, Alabama NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado responded to Amazon’s statement by noting that the independent agency has been authorised by Congress to enforce the National Labour Relations Act.“All NLRB enforcement actions against Amazon have been consistent with that Congressional mandate,” she said.The successful union effort on Staten Island stood in contrast to the one launched in Bessemer, Alabama by the more established Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.Workers at an Amazon warehouse there appeared to have rejected a union bid but outstanding challenged ballots could change the outcome. The votes were -to- against the union. A hearing to review  challenged ballots is expected to begin in the next few days.Amazon has long been considered a top prize for the labour movement given the company’s massive size and impact. The results in Staten Island reverberated all the way to the White House.“The president was glad to see workers ensure their voices are heard with respect to important workplace decisions,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at Friday’s briefing about the vote.“He believes firmly that every worker in every state must have a free and fair choice to join a union and the right to bargain collectively with their employer.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Amazon workers in NYC vote to unionise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHe issued the warning as the humanitarian crisis in the encircled city of Mariupol deepened and the Kremlin accused the Ukrainians of launching a helicopter attack on a fuel depot on Russian soil.Ukraine denied responsibility for the fiery blast, butMoscow’s claim is confirmed, it would be the war’s first known attack in which Ukrainian aircraft penetrated Russian airspace.“Certainly, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Russia continued withdrawing some of its ground forces from areas around Kyiv after saying earlier this week it would reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital and the northern city of Chernihiv.“They are mining the whole territory. They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,” Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address to the nation.“There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.”He urged residents to wait to resume their normal lives until they are assured that the mines have been cleared and the danger of shelling has passed.While the Russians kept up their bombardment around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Ukrainian troops exploited the pullback on the ground by mounting counterattacks and retaking a number of towns and villages.Still, Ukraine and its allies warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating to promote trust at the bargaining table, as it claimed, but instead resupplying and shting its troops to the country’s east. Those movements appear to be preparation for an intensied assault on the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the country’s east, which includes Mariupol..removeMr Zelensky warned of dficult battles ahead as the Russians redeploy troops. “We are preparing for an even more active defence,” he said.He did not say anything about the latest round of talks, which took place on Friday by video. At a round of talks earlier in the week, Ukraine said it would be willing to abandon a bid to join Nato and declare itself neutral – Moscow’s chief demand – infor security guarantees from several other countries.The invasion has left thousands dead and driven more than four million refugees from Ukraine.Elsewhere, at least three Russian ballistic missiles were fired late on Friday from the Crimean Peninsula at the Odesa region on the Black Sea, regional leader Maksim Marchenko said. The Ukrainian military said the Iskander missiles were intended for critical infrastructure but did not hit their targets because of Ukraine’s air-defence forces. It was unclear where they hit.Mr Marchenko said there were casualties, but he did not elaborate. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Zelensky warned of dficult battles ahead as the Russians redeploy troops Odesa is Ukraine’s largest port and the headquarters of its navy.As for the fuel depot explosion, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said two Ukrainian helicopter gunships flew in extremely low and attacked the civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of the city of Belgorod, about  miles from the Ukraine border.The regional governor said two workers at the depot were wounded, but the Rosneft state oil company denied anyone was hurt.Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, said on Ukrainian television: “For some reason they say that we did it, but in fact this does not correspond with reality.”In an interview with Fox, Mr Zelensky refused to say whether Ukraine launched the attack.Amid the Russian pullback on the ground and its continued bombardment, Ukraine’s military said it had retaken  settlements in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Zelensky: Retreating Russians leave mines behind article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We’ve had some good results over them recently and we can’t wait to move on.”How to watch: Scotland v France will be shown live on BBC One or you can catch up via BBC iPlayer.England v WalesCourtney Lawes has completed histo play protocols and comes into contention to face Wales next week.

Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills.

I’ve collected about , big bags of rubbish since I started and I’ve worn out my boots.”Mandy’s community work also includes setting up friendship and wellbeing groups to interacting with village youth to change attitudes and inspiring others by her example.The  competition rewards efforts made by both groups and iniduals who reached out and supported rural communities during the Covid- crisis.Mandy with Mark Alexander and Patrick FrewIt also gives rural communities and their local groups a chance to showcase the range of activities that they are involved with, helping to keep their areas vibrant, attractive places to live.Patrick Frew, Chair of Cloughmills Community Action Team, praised Mandy for her continued efforts, especially during lockdown.“We nominated Mandy for a whole raft of community activities. She is originally from Liverpool and had been living abroad before she came to Cloughmills but lost no time becoming integrated into community le. This award is a huge testament to how well-regarded she has become,” he said.“Mandy started by volunteering in the community garden but developed an interest in keeping the area tidy. She is a familiar figure going out in all weathers to litter pick, at times walking nine to  miles a day, and even pulling old tyres out of hedges. Then she uses her creative talents to make dragonflies and flowers out of tin cans.“Mandy is also good at identying people who are perhaps lonely or on the margins of the community and bringing them onboard. Our community is so much richer thanks to her generous and kindly spirit and we are delighted that her tireless efforts have been recognised.”Mark Alexander, the Housing Executive’s Causeway Area Manager, congratulated Mandy on her achievement.“A big well done to Mandy on her award! She deserves this recognition due to her outstanding volunteering work in Cloughmills,” he said.“Mandy has had a hugely positive impact on this community and has provided important human contact for people during Covid, which has been a very dficult time for many. She has also encouraged others to take pride in their environment.“Our Community Champion Award was introduced to recognise that very often it takes the vision and perseverance of one extraordinary community member to make things happen. Mandy is a fine example of that.”Read More Read MoreBig beach clean up by local schoolsRural Community Champion Award  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCurry’s Fun Park Portrush announce new rides, tokens and app...News stabbed in bottle attack in Lurgan\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime boy--stabbed-in-bottle-attack-in-lurgan- itm_sourceparsely-api\" stabbed in bottle attack in Lurgan\" \"\" width\"\" stabbed in bottle attack in Lurgan\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime boy--stabbed-in-bottle-attack-in-lurgan- itm_sourceparsely-api\"Boystabbed in bottle attack in Lurgan...NewsLarne man given suspended jail term for harassing ex-partner...NewsCookstown man admitted stealing wine...NewsRathcoole murder: Two men charged after body of Roy Reynolds...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I spend more time with them than anybody , so it’s a strange feeling, but I know it is the right time to leave.“For this next part of the journey I have made no plans, I have just stepped out.“I have been blessed so much, soI can give back and help others that is what I will continue to do.”Praising Mr Jeffrey for his dedicated service, a spokesperson for the Northern Trust said: “David has been a compassionate and focused ambassador of social work delivering a high standard of leadership and service to the people of Larne and colleagues within the multidisciplinary family.“A true legend has retired and will be sorely missed, but is wished a happy and healthy retirement with much love and blessings from his team.”----Read More Read MoreRecord number of Antrim and Newtownabbey children living in povertyNorthern Health and Social Care TrustLarneLinfield  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCurry’s Fun Park Portrush announce new rides, tokens and app...News stabbed in bottle attack in Lurgan\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime boy--stabbed-in-bottle-attack-in-lurgan- itm_sourceparsely-api\" stabbed in bottle attack in Lurgan\" \"\" width\"\" stabbed in bottle attack in Lurgan\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime boy--stabbed-in-bottle-attack-in-lurgan- itm_sourceparsely-api\"Boystabbed in bottle attack in Lurgan...NewsLarne man given suspended jail term for harassing ex-partner...NewsCookstown man admitted stealing wine...NewsRathcoole murder: Two men charged after body of Roy Reynolds...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

With his ear for a good story and eye for detail, Jack, who founded the historical group in , takes readers on a mirthful trip down memory lane.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers. As for those dogs on the front and back covers  Surely it’s worth the £. sale price to find out!

Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm.

This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

We told you that the tree used to make ballot paper – Flora Plio – was in short supply. Of course there’s no such thing as a Flora Plio, which is an anagram of April Fool. Our paper production expert, Poppy Cox, was indeed a load of poppycock, and of course we couldn’t do an April Fool about paper without mentioning foolscap. And we had to make our ‘official’ statement at midday because,we hadn’t, we’d be the fools for carrying on!  The forthcoming election is set to be postponed for a fortnight due to insufficient amounts of the correct type of ballot paper, we understand. It is believed that the specic type of tree used to make the paper - Flora Plio – has been in short supply in recent months. Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added. An official statement on the matter is due to be made at midday today .  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdddfeeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbecffadae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
