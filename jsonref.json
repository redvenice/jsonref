David Cordier, 36, pictured at the wheel of his Mercedes Sprinter van, said he has had more than 250 near misses during his 18 years of driving         However, a large section got stuck to his windscreen, forcing him to pull over Mr Cordier said: \u0027I noticed it was wobbling so I slowed down quickly. If that had hit another car, it could have ended with someone in hospital.\u0027What idiot driving a vehicle like that doesn\u0027t make sure they\u0027ve strapped their load in? It\u0027s so dangerous.\u0027Mr Cordier drives around 800 miles a week covering the South East. He spends around six hours a day on the road.On June 25 a sheet of polystyrene covered his vision of the road ahead - so he had to think quickly to pull over safely and, incredibly, avoid a serious crash.The incident, also caught on his dashcam, happened on the A2 near Gravesend, Kent. The polystyrene breaks out from another van and flings back into Mr Cordier\u0027s path.He said: \u0027I\u0027ve gone past the stage of panicking these days. When that happened, I just had to visualise what had been in front of me and use my wing mirrors as much as possible.\u0027I just pulled over in the hard shoulder as soon as I knew it was safe to do so.\u0027The driver had done everything they could to stop the polystyrene coming off but it was just one of those things that happens.\u0027As soon as I had a big enough gap to my left I pulled over.\u0027He says the most terrifying ordeal while driving was last June, when a brick fell from a tractor mower, bounced off the road and smashed into his windscreen.         Mr Cordier travels around 800 miles per week in his van and witnesses object flying off other vehicles on a regular basis It happened on the A20 at Lenham, near Maidstone in Kent, and was caught on dashcam.The brick shattered the windscreen but did not make it through the glass. He said: \u0027That was the worst one I had. I thought the brick was going to kill me.\u0027Yet another nerve-wracking near miss came in December, when a motorist was coming in the opposite direction on the M20 in Folkestone, Kent.He added: \u0027That was definitely the scariest moment. Again, I was doing 65mph but they were going at the same speed in the outside lane.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it. I called the police as soon as I could.\u0027Soon after he got his licence in 2001, Mr Cordier was out on a motorbike when a driver failed to halt at a stop sign and smashed into him, flipping him across the car\u0027s bonnet.But he escaped unscathed and a police officer said he was lucky not to break his neck.Another dashcam clip from September 2017 shows Mr Cordier being overtaken by a careless Volvo driver who cuts across him to barely make it on to a slip road.Mr Cordier was also caught in a 130-car pile up on Kent\u0027s Sheppey Crossing in 2013 which injured dozens - but not him.He added: \u0027It\u0027s surreal watching the footage back.

Here’s how the 149-year-old bank ran into trouble.The Frankfurt-based lender embarks on a period of global expansion, beginning with the acquisition of blue-blooded merchant bank Morgan Grenfell in the UK.Capitalising on the rapid pace of globalisation, it pushes into European markets such as Spain, where it buys Banco de Madrid. Acquisitions are part of its ambition to become a major player in investment banking.It consolidates its US operations into one, in an effort to take on the big beasts of Wall Street such as Goldman Sachs, and in 1999 it builds on its US foothold by snapping up New York-based Bankers Trust for $10bn (£8bn).Deutsche Bank floats on the New York Stock Exchange, cementing its position as one of the major players, not just on Wall Street but in global banking.In the years leading up to the banking crash, Deutsche Bank is a leader in mortgage-backed securities, bundling up homeowners’ debt into huge packages and selling them on to investors. The bank continues to sell toxic mortgage-based investments even as the market turns south and it begins betting against such products itself.A key character in The Big Short movie about the sub-prime scandal – played by Ryan Gosling – was based on a Deutsche Bank trader who was enabling investors to bet against the very market in which Deutsche was involved.In 2008 the bank reports its first annual loss for five decades , losing €3.9bn. “We have made mistakes, as everyone did,” said chief executive Josef Ackermann.An internal investigation finds that the bank hired private detectives to spy on people it considered a threat to the bank – including a shareholder, a journalist and a member of the public. German prosecutors find no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or that senior executives were involved.Deutsche’s boss Josef Ackermann, a Swiss banker, stepped down after a decade in the top job in May 2012. He was succeeded by joint chief executives Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen, who resigned  in the wake of the Libor scandal. A British banker, John Cryan, took over, but he left in 2018 having failed to get to grips with the bank’s problems. Deutsche’s shares lost more than half their value under Cryan as it struggled to return to profitability. He was succeeded by Christian Sewing, who said yesterday the bank had “no choice” in axing 18,000 staff.Deutsche is fined $2.5bn (£1.7bn) by US and UK regulators for rigging the key Libor interest rate. The bank was also ordered to fire seven employees and accused of being obstructive towards regulators in their investigations into the global manipulation of the benchmark rate. The fine is a record for Libor transgressions.Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank\u0027s chief executive, told staff that the cutbacks were regrettable but inevitable: “We are making deep cuts. I personally greatly regret the impact this will have on some of you. In the long-term interests of our bank, however, we have no choice.”An equities trader in New York predicted that the layoffs on the equities floor would be swift: “It’s obviously going to suck for a couple of years.”One IT worker leaving their City of London office said the bad news was dished out briskly on Monday morning: “I was terminated this morning. There was a very quick meeting and that was it.”An equities trader emerged from Deutsche Bank’s London offices and headed to the pub, saying: “I got laid off where else would I go?”Another equities trader in Hong Kong said their offices had been gripped by news of the layoffs: “There is hardly any work getting done today and folks are just mailing or calling friends or headhunters. Half of the floor is gone and others are just waiting to be called in. Some people are saying their byes even before being called in.”A banker leaving the Hong Kong office confirmed that Deutsche had begun implementing the cuts on Monday: “If you have a job for me, please let me know.”A Singapore banker who remains in his job questioned whether Sewing’s plan would revive Deutsche’s fortunes: “The biggest question for us is where do we go from here if we don’t offer the whole suite of products? Will clients stick with us or is the game over?”Banking expert Philip Augar says Deutsche had bowed to the inevitable: “Their ambition was to challenge the Wall Street giants. And for about decade, it looked as though they’d pulled it off … They’ve been limping along for the last few years and I suppose this day had to come.”Anke Reingen of Royal Bank of Canada said the restructuring was more radical than expected: “However, as the plan pushes the profitability improvement further out in time on our estimates, we see more value elsewhere in the sector. Maintaining our rating of underperform, speculative risk.” Graeme WeardenThe bank is fined a further $258m in the US for doing business with US-sanctioned countries like Iran and Syria.As regulators continue to sift through the wreckage of the banking crash, Deutsche takes a large slice of the blame. In September 2016, its shares slump on news that the institution faces a $14bn charge over mis-selling mortgage securities in the US. It eventually reaches a $7.2bn settlement with the US Department of Justice.In 2017 UK and US regulators fine Deutsche more than $630m after finding that the lender failed to prevent $10bn of Russian money laundering via “mirror trades”, which had no economic purpose and served only to transfer money covertly.Last year New York financial regulators hand down a fresh fine, $205m this time, for “lax oversight” in the bank’s foreign exchange business between 2007 and 2013, when it was the world’s largest dealer in foreign currency.The US Congress issues subpoenas to Deutsche for documents related to the bank’s dealings with Donald Trump. The New York Times reports that senior Deutsche executives blocked employees from alerting the federal government about suspicious activity alerts linked to Trump and Jared Kusher in 2016 and 2017.Deutsche was one of Trump’s biggest lenders, sticking by the real estate mogul when other US banks refused to lend after he went through a series of bankruptcies. Trump is thought to have borrowed at least $2bn from Deutsche with about $300m outstanding.The bank’s entanglement with the Trump family dates back to the 1990s when Bankers Trust continued to lend to him when others had pulled out. In 2008 Trump claimed the financial crisis was an unforeseen event and refused to repay $330m to Deutsche, countersuing for $3bn compensation for Deutsche’s role in the crisis.Trump and Deutsche’s commercial real estate ision settled in 2010 but Deutsche’s private banking business continued to lend to Trump.After struggling to recover from the financial crisis, Deutsche attempts to organise a merger with another troubled German lender, Commerzbank. The talks fell apart in April, scuppering plans for a bank that would have been the eurozone’s second largest. The German government had been in favour of the deal, but the two banks said the risks and costs were too great."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bca28730eb72b5fd8c1c154a0954f1166efddce/0_230_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98ced878dbdd5006da94450d45428bd0","title":"bmw electric mini price","story":"New model will have list price of £24,400, with first deliveries expected in early 2020Six decades after the original Mini first rolled off the production line in Oxford, its owner BMW has unveiled a new electric version it hopes will herald a new era – and help the German carmaker meet looming EU emissions targets.BMW said it had 15,000 expressions of interest before order books open on Tuesday. The first deliveries to customers are expected in the first quarter of 2020, with a list price of £24,400, after the government’s plug-in car grant of £3,500 has been applied.While the original Mini was built by the British Motor Corporation in response to fuel rationing following the Suez crisis of 1956, the latest version will help BMW, which relaunched the Mini brand in 2000, reduce the average emissions of the cars it sells to meet EU carbon dioxide emissions limits.Oliver Zipse, the BMW board member in charge of production, said: “We are entering an era in which electric cars will become a normal choice for our customers.“The Mini Electric will kick off our new model offensive for fully electric vehicles.”The launch comes at a particularly important moment for BMW as it seeks a new chief executive after Harald Krüger last week said he would not seek an extension of his term in office.Zipse, a previous Oxford plant director, is seen as a leading contender to replace Krüger, alongside the research and development chief, Klaus Fröhlich and the chief financial officer, Nicolas Peter.The new chief executive will oversee a plan to launch 25 new electrified models by 2023, with at least 13 full-electric rather than hybrid. However, the company has also hedged its bets by producing its full-electric, hybrid, and internal combustion models using the same underlying blueprint and the same production lines – meaning it can quickly switch between fuel types in response to customer demand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f37c9decfa353f69dbc8bfb25f7e08159c4521ab/156_0_3408_2045/master/3408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88d4cba6d33f2cfe3410a37a315e575c","title":"do you live in a city planned from scratch share your experiences","story":"New cities are being built around the world at an unprecedented pace.

Many still live thereby Mathieu Richer and  Andrew MacDowallIn her flat overlooking the main square of Dimitrovgrad, 90-year-old Maria Oteva casts her mind back more than seven decades to the foundation of the town in the early years of Bulgaria’s communist era.“Back then, 50,000 volunteers built this city because they believed in something,” she says. “Nowadays, you wouldn’t find 50 people to come and clean up the dirty streets.”Oteva was one of those volunteers, aged 17 and eager to build a new socialist Bulgaria after the ravages of the second world war. She had joined the partisan resistance against the Nazi-allied government as a young teenager before joining the regular army in 1944 when Bulgaria, under Soviet occupation, switched sides. She operated a machine gun and then worked as a medic as the army fought its way into Hungary.Following the war, she joined the police force before being invited to join the “brigades” movement of volunteers being assembled by the new communist government for public works projects.The most ambitious of these was Dimitrovgrad, a city that was to exemplify the brave new world being created. Its spacious streets, parks and imposing public buildings, constructed in “Stalin baroque” style, still stand today.Scores of new cities are rising across the world from previously untouched desert and jungle, or on land “reclaimed” from the sea.

We remember past visions of future cities and ask, is there ever a good reason to start a city from scratch?Oteva was the leader of the first group of “brigadiers” to work on Dimitrovgrad, following a course of lessons in construction techniques. She lives in one of the original buildings constructed for workers in the city and spends much of the day on the balcony looking out over the town hall, watching life go by and children playing.“I believed strongly in the ideas and perspectives offered by socialism,” Oteva says. “It gave people power and the keys to their future.”Dimitrovgrad was constructed on the site of three small villages, and named after the first communist leader of Bulgaria, Georgi Dimitrov, who would die two years after the city was founded. According to the regime’s official version of events, Dimitrovgrad was established on 10 May 1947 when a group of 40 young people arrived at the site on the banks of the Maritsa River on the Thracian Plain and decided to build the city of the future. It was to be a symbol of the conversion of a predominantly rural society to an industrialised, urban one.The zeitgeist of that era is strikingly portrayed in murals at the Asen Zlatarov high school, the first built for the children of Dimitrovgrad’s workers. They depict the glory of workers striving to build a better country and future, with idealised communist images of family life, work, education and sport.“Dimitrovgrad was very significant, it was the first of the grand communist projects, and they constructed a totally new city according to communist ideals of urbanism,” says Dimana Trankova, a writer who has authored a three-volume book on communist Bulgaria and written extensively about the city. “The project was very important in showcasing the new Bulgarian government.”For some, the communist dream faded quickly. Penyo Penev, a poet, was an early and enthusiastic arrival in the city, and his works were promoted by the regime. But Penev killed himself aged 28, apparently disillusioned with the reality of life in the new utopia. His old apartment is one of the city’s few tourist attractions.As Trankova points out, not everyone participating in the brigades was an enthusiastic participant. While many were already won over by the relentless communist message, some felt compelled to join to improve their standing with the new regime, having come from families that had fallen foul of it.One of these was Peter Sharkov, now an 81-year-old author. Sharkov was born in a small village in south-west Bulgaria. When the communists came to power, his father’s land was seized by the government. Jobless and fearing imprisonment, the younger Sharkov travelled to Dimitrovgrad and enrolled as a brigade manager building housing units, despite his antipathy to communism.“That time was good for poorer workers, who had the certainty of a decent living but it was a hard time for the wealthier families, who saw their property and land confiscated,” he says, adding that he still feels resentment about the communist period. Nonetheless, he feels a certain pride towards Dimitrovgrad.“It’s important that the heritage is preserved,” he says. “All of this is made with our sweat. Everything has to be maintained – it was built by decent people who thought they believed in something. You can’t take that away from them.”After the fall of communism, a large statute of Dimitrov was removed from the city centre, and now lies face-down in a corner of a park. Sharkov, like many others in the city, would like to see it reinstated.Dimitrovgrad has made a rapid and incongruous transition to capitalist consumerism, says Trankova. Located at a crossroads near the Turkish border, the city developed a huge and lively market for previously unavailable goods, drawing shoppers and traders from around the region. Today, thousands come across the frontier to gamble in its gaudy casinos, which are illegal in Turkey.Dimitrovgrad is also regarded as the birthplace of chalga, a pop-folk style of music that embraces the sort of vulgar lyrics and conspicuous consumption that would have shocked the early pioneers. Finally, the city was re-dedicated: its name now officially refers to St Demetrios, a saint popular in the region, rather than the late communist leader.For many younger residents, times have moved. Ivo Ivanov, 25, and his 27-year-old wife, Viktoriya, typify a generation that has no direct memory of the communist era.The couple are worried about the country in which they are bringing up their three-year-old son, describing it as plagued by corruption and social injustice. A chemical factory originally named after Stalin employs about 1,000 people. This is a far cry from the days when it provided jobs for 10,000 workers and was the lifeblood of the local economy. The couple are preparing to move to the UK. Many of their friends are jobless.“We have a better life than our parents did under communism,” says Ivanov. “We want to get rid of the label of ‘communist town’ and start building a future with the help of the EU and young people across Europe.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/121e76219b62980f469772810324619a9764898c/0_0_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=628556a30fc5e7eefeaa76aa4510085f","title":"cities from scratch 100 and counting new cities rise from the desert jungle and sea","story":"Spectacular timelapse satellite images show boom in cities built from scratch across Asia and Africa“We’re in the midst of new cities fever,” says Prof Sarah Moser. The head of the new cities lab at McGill University has documented more than 100 cities that have sprung up across Asia and Africa since the early 2000s for her forthcoming Atlas of New Cities.There’s Eko Atlantic, a “new Dubai” taking shape on reclaimed land off the coast of Nigeria, and Forest City, a “new Singapore” being built just over the Johor Strait from the original. There’s the New Silk Road city of Khorgos rising from the barren steppe that separates Kazakhstan and China, the “sustainable city” of Neom in Saudi Arabia, the Norman Foster-designed Masdar in Abu Dhabi, a few in Latin America … and even a Robotic New City in Malaysia.Most are in places where rapid urbanisation and population growth have overwhelmed existing cities. Sometimes masterplanned cities are a way for countries in the global south to kickstart an economic transition out of agriculture or from resource-based economies. They can also allow governments to write their country’s image afresh. “That’s a very seductive idea, especially in countries that were colonised,” says Moser.“It’s easy for leaders to whip up some nationalist frenzy and sell the new city as a source of national pride. The computer-generated models look beautiful too – all the old city problems are just gone – and it looks magically real. It’s compelling for people who live in overcrowded and polluted places.”Moser says the money to be made is staggering – measured in the trillions of dollars. “It’s extremely lucrative,” she adds. “There are real estate and tech companies circling like sharks.”Officials in coal-rich Inner Mongolia announced plans for a city of 1 million people in the parched desert and grasslands south of Ordos Dongsheng in 2003. Six years later the part-built development of Ordos Kangbashi became notorious around the world as a “ghost city”, as news reports highlighted the lack of people, aroundabout 30,000 at the time. Images showed a vast central public space – almost the size of Tiananmen Square in Beijing – and rows of identical empty apartment blocks. There are signs the city has started to fill up. A 2017 report from the state-run Xinhua news agency claimed a permanent population of 153,000, with almost 5,000 active businesses. Wade Shepard, author of The Ghost Cities of China, believes that by the city’s expected completion date of 2023 it should have met its revised population target of 300,000 people. “It regularly takes western cities five to 10 years to build civil engineering projects such as new subway lines,” he points out. “Ordos Kangbashi probably should have impressed the world with its rapid pace of development.”The former prime minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad announced plans in the late 1980s to shift the nation’s administrative capital from congested, overcrowded Kuala Lumpur to a new city built on former oil and rubber plantations 25 miles (40km) to the south. Putrajaya would join the ranks of purpose-built capitals around the world: from Canberra in Australia to Islamabad in Pakistan, Abuja in Nigeria to Washington DC in the US.Construction began in the mid-1990s. Putrajaya was billed as an “intelligent garden city”: more than a third of the land is reserved for green spaces, with 200 hectares (494 acres) of wetlands and a 400-hectare manmade lake – as well as the world’s largest roundabout.Although the Asian financial crisis of 1997 put a temporary halt on development, the city is now fully functioning: almost all government departments have moved there, along with an estimated population of 88,000. It has been praised for its innovative architecture, community and environmental focus a “manicured Malaysia” of office blocks, hotels and pretty parks.The city of New Cairo – in the desert 20 miles to the east of its namesake – was conceived in the late 1990s and established by presidential decree in 2000. Not to be confused with the as-yet-unnamed new administrative capital proposed by president Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi in 2014 (another 20 miles east and dubbed the “new New Cairo”), the original New Cairo was meant to attract a population of 5 million. A few hundred-thousand currently call it home. Where Ordos and New Cairo rose from the desert and Putrajaya from the jungle, the new city of Songdo was built on land reclaimed from the Yellow Sea. Songdo International Business District was envisioned as a sustainable, low-carbon, hi-tech “ubiquitous city” – with all the advantages of Seoul, 30 miles to the north, but without the congestion and air pollution.All major buildings are constructed to LEED green standards a network of underground tubes sucks all household and office waste to processing facilities, eliminating the need for rubbish trucks residents can remotely control lighting and air conditioning, while street sensors monitor traffic flow. Many of those futuristic features, though, are starting to look a little commonplace.Master-planned by New York architecture firm Kohn Pedersen Fox, Songdo is the world’s most expensive private real estate development. As of last year, the population was estimated at just over 100,000 people – around a third of its target. The 2015 completion date has been pushed back to 2022."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eea56d3df011efdc6be5485b2252c7e2a09d536/0_1757_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=963eff78f4453bee0787f8084f5fbebc","title":"casual racism international students university","story":"“The international students never mingle.” “Their English is terrible.” “I hate walking behind international students because they walk so slow.” These are just a few of the phrases I’ve heard while I have been at university. I was surprised by the amount of subtle racism I encountered when I arrived three years ago to a place that I thought was going to be liberal, inclusive and universal. Yet racism towards international students is rarely acknowledged.As a British-Chinese person at university, I quickly realised that people always assumed me to be an international student, even though I grew up in Rugby, Warwickshire.For example, one evening last year I was taking out cash from an ATM. I heard from behind me: “Why is Jackie Chan taking so long?” I had been there for a maximum of 20 seconds, but the student felt the need to say something that would highlight my race. I don’t think he was aware of his own racism or offensiveness, and his intent probably wasn’t to offend me but to make the girl he was with laugh.Yet this is a perfect example of how microaggressions work in our society and how they are still racially charged, even though my fellow student probably wasn’t aware of how problematic he was being. His intent was to make a joke out of me, by bringing me down in order to lift himself up. Historically, this is not a new story: a white male trying to make others feel inferior to make himself feel superior.Not every home-student is racist of course, but it is a big enough problem that I have been made to feel inferior or different in the country that I call home.International students often find themselves the butt of a joke, because for home-students they are an easy target. English is usually a second language and their language abilities are often underestimated. Had the student at the ATM known I was also raised in Britain, would he have said the same thing out loud so confidently behind me? Probably not.Having experienced the discrimination and prejudice that international students face, I feel it is time for all of us to acknowledge the importance of international students to our universities. They bring ersity, culture and knowledge, and not just to our universities but to our economy and society as well. • Sam Phan, 22, is a recent graduate in modern languages at Sheffield University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7773588bded6593a79466c3704c68240e251a714/505_1136_3672_2203/master/3672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8da7841f0a4bf3640fd1754ffd27457","title":"happy summer children cave in","story":"Yesterday was a good day. I caved on the Gatorade (one blue, one red, when really, they should have shared a single bottle), but held the line on the Skittles. After the park, we went for pizza at the usual place and I stayed firm on water at the table – no fruit punch, in spite of my deal with the waitress to secretly dilute it.And then this small triumph: ice-cream from the van on the way home, yes. But two bites in, when one of them changed her mind about which ice-cream she wanted and the other, predictably, dropped hers on the ground and wanted a replacement – Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen! – I did not give way.When is the cave-in dangerous and when is it sensible? I can never figure this out. If you let them control you too much they’ll grow up to be mad, screaming nightmares who can’t handle the world. But inflexibility leads to behaviours too, and means you are destined to spend all your time fighting. “Pick your battles”, people say, but it’s a full-time job equivalent to directing a medium-sized movie in which you have to make 35 decisions an hour.And they are cunning. They learn. They tiptoe up to the line, knowing that the nearer they get, the greater the likelihood they have of crossing over. Where, at first, my daughter said, “I don’t want to eat it, I just want to hold it” – delivered while eyeing the crisp packet that had been banned until after dinner – lately this has evolved into fullblown reverse psychology.“I don’t want candy, I don’t want to get cavities!” she says winsomely, giving me a frankly terrifying look straight out of the black ops handbook. I know what she’s doing. I can see it. And yet I find myself thinking, “Oh, look what amazing powers of self-denial she has,” plus hat tip for the long game being played here. More often than not, I give in.Then the fightback begins. “That’s not how it works” is my go-to phrase of the moment, as if there is some higher authority on everything from crisp allocation to play-date arrangements that it’s simply beyond my pay grade to challenge. I accompany this with an “I wish I could help” look and a we’re-all-victims-here shrug. “I know right?!” I say sorrowfully. “It sucks! Man.”The psychologists say it is our job to understand the bellowing child and recognise her emotions as valid. And I do I recognise that when someone who liked bananas yesterday decides they don’t like them today they are, at some level, trying to control their environment because it is frightening to be a child. I also recognise that control is a reflex that doesn’t always have to represent something more fraught.Last night, I let them sleep in the clothes they’d been wearing all day, and this morning, after only the smallest amount of begging, I let them go to camp in those same clothes. They’re only four, I reasoned. They don’t sweat and dirt doesn’t kill. And, OK, they look like children from a Shirley Hughes novel who just emerged from a hedge. But my gosh, in those filthy clothes they were happy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf69f92fafc7b459e744886f0a5dfb5320c39b18/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09d4ed274996dbba00d4521e40b61fe5","title":"labour second referendum jeremy corbyn brexit","story":"The unions have cornered Jeremy Corbyn into agreeing to a second Brexit vote. But, as ever, it’s not that simpleIs Labour really the party of remain, or leave? The official answer for a good three years has been both, which increasingly means in the eyes of many voters it is neither convincingly. The paradox of this week’s otherwise seismic shift in Labour Brexit positioning is that once the dust settles, essentially that’s still true.Jeremy Corbyn does seem finally to have been cornered into a second referendum on Brexit, with trade union leaders unanimously agreeing this week that if a Conservative government brings any sort of deal (or a firm date for leaving with no deal) before parliament, Labour should demand a referendum on it and campaign to remain.So it’s a pro-remain party now? Well, not exactly. The unions also agreed that if Labour wins a general election before Brexit has been agreed, Labour should pick up where the Tories left off by negotiating to leave, and leave open the option of campaigning against remaining in the ensuing referendum on their own deal. Tory Brexit: bad. Labour Brexit: good, even if it’s remarkably similar to the Tory deal, which seems likely given the narrow economic and political tramlines within which the EU is operating. What matters, apparently, isn’t the principle of Brexit so much as who gets to be in charge of it.Still, credit where credit is due for those who have fought long and hard to get this far. Labour may at least now avoid the humiliation of being outflanked on the pro-remain side by the likes of Philip Hammond, the Conservative chancellor whose willingness to do whatever it takes to stop no deal is increasingly evident. The wider Labour movement seems to have successfully asserted itself against the leader’s closest advisers, although it should be said we have all been marched up this hill before only to be marched straight down again. The consolation prize for MPs in pro-leave seats is that they might still get to fight them on a manifesto which, like the last one, commits Labour to leaving. The question is whether Corbyn has left it too late to get the credit for belatedly and begrudgingly doing what much of his party thinks is the right thing.It is a huge thing to rip up your membership card after 40 years, or even to put a cross against an unfamiliar name on the voting slip. Even in volatile times, it takes a lot for loyal voters to give up on a party and once that rubicon is crossed, it isn’t so easily recrossed. So while many Labour remainers will simply be relieved to have an excuse to come home, others will want to see more than a graceless volte face executed in a hurry (and in the middle of another embarrassing row about antisemitism). It may take a rather bigger, bolder break with the recent past before they are prepared to trust Labour again.Meanwhile the months of confusion have given the Liberal Democrats both a chance to detoxify and a reason to exist, something they have grabbed with both hands. That genie is not going back in the bottle easily, with whoever becomes the new leader likely to seek every opportunity to embarrass Labour on Brexit. There remains a palpable risk of Corbyn finally catching up with last year’s argument, just as time runs out for a referendum and Westminster moves on to contemplating a potential nightmare choice between leaving without a deal and parliament unilaterally revoking the whole thing.If there is one thing left on which all Labour factions can agree, it’s a longing to move on from arguing about Europe to discussing the issues sorely neglected as a result of it. But on this evidence, they are likely to be disappointed for a while yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a06b0a196668fba1fd0b32b065f4583611c883/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb5f29fd82273c3ece072e08a1ba66c","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of summer","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘summer’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘summer’.Share your photos of what summer means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 10 July at 10am.

He told Lewis his student loan wasn’t big enough to cover living costs, but his parents wouldn’t help because they believed he should stand on his own two feet. A frustrated Lewis, who has campaigned extensively for the government to openly tell parents it expects them to stump up thousands of pounds to top up student loans, explained that this is not how the system works.It’s essential you understand that parental money has been quietly written into student finance. So, for students and parents in England, here are your questions answered.In the UK the student maintenance loan helps cover living expenses such as accommodation, food and bills. The amount students are entitled to varies, from up to £7,324 for those living at home, to up to £11,354 for those living away from home and in London.The amount you get also depends on how much your parents earn. This means students from higher-income households will get a lower amount. The government unofficially expects higher-earning parents in England to top up the rest – but it doesn’t tell them.If your household income is £25,000 or under, you are entitled to the full loan amount. Once the household income is £30,000 or more you will not get the full amount. For example, if you have a household income of £30,000 and live at home, the maintenance loan is £6,707 with an extra £617 needed. But if it’s £58,210 or more and you live at home, the loan is just £3,224, making the implied parental contribution £4,100.It’s been hidden from you, Lewis says. This is arguably for political reasons middle and higher-income parents – who are also voters – might not like being told to foot the bill.When you get your student loan letter it explains how much money you’ll get, but it doesn’t tell you the full amount you could have been given. Nor will it explicitly say parents are expected to pay the difference. “I would describe it as an ‘unofficial official’ parental contribution,” Lewis says.It might not be an easy conversation to have, but it’s an important one. “Quite often students feel guilty about asking for money,” says Sharon Sweeney, a student funding officer at the University of Dundee. Chloe Aspland, a money adviser at Swansea University, suggests you start by working out how much you need to live on. Many universities have this information on their websites, she says. “We have a cost of living page I refer students to.” Once you know how much you need, you can take the information, along with your loan amount, to your parents.Have the conversation before you go to university if possible, Sweeney recommends. “That way, parents will understand what you’re facing,” she says. “Whereas if you leave it to the time when you really need the extra help, they might think you’ve overspent.”There’s no way to force your parents to give you the money if they can’t or don’t want to. If this is the case there are other options, such as getting a part-time job or financial help from the university. The most important thing is to seek help, says Gareth Pearse, a student support coordinator at Bath Spa University. “All universities will have some form of advice centre,” he adds. “We would sit down and go through the situation. We’d check you’re receiving your full entitlement and help you to access available employment options.”In his review of higher education, Philip Augar recommended student loan letters explicitly say when students are not getting the full amount. But an implied parental contribution is unlikely to be scrapped altogether, Lewis says, so the best you can do is know about it – and make sure your parents do too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b4a52064376939f8ce2592ab1bd7b5291eff6a3/0_228_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9141bdf7bf721547a88faef6e56f6545","title":"lawyer wants academics come out as working class","story":"Geraldine Van Bueren, professor of international human rights law at Queen Mary University of London, spent her infancy in the east London borough of Hackney in the days when, as she puts it, nobody pronounced the “h”. Her father, later a taxi driver, worked in local factories, and her mother was a bookkeeper at Smithfield meat market. Though she doesn’t have the accent, she is a cockney, born within the sound of Bow Bells.But her working-class background was something she kept quiet about among academic colleagues. Then one day, she recalls, a distressed student came to see her “torn between what she wanted to be and her community, friends and family”. When Van Bueren told her, “I understand what you’re going through”, the student leapt up and shouted: “How dare you? You couldn’t possibly know.” The student was astonished when Van Bueren said she, too, was working class. “Later, I got shy knocks on the door from other working-class students wanting to talk,” she says.Now Van Bueren has started the Association of Working Class Academics, which has recently met the vice-chancellors’ body, Universities UK, to discuss how the class backgrounds of British academics could be widened. That, she argues, is essential for students from poor homes to have role models to make them feel they belong at university and help with awkward social adjustments.I met Van Bueren, a QC, in London’s Doughty Street Chambers, of which she is a member alongside other celebrated liberal barristers such as Amal Clooney and Helena Kennedy. She has the kind of dedication to human rights that sends certain Tory backbenchers apoplectic: she helped to draft the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child she claims Britain is legally bound to pay reparations for the slave trade she argues that Britain, as a signatory of the UN Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, has violated international law by introducing high university fees. The Human Rights Act, she says, doesn’t go nearly far enough: it should also incorporate rights to food, water, adequate housing, and high health standards.Her views on what the law should do are diametrically opposite to those of this year’s Reith lecturer, the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption, who argued that lawyers are usurping the role of politicians.“In academia, people don’t feel able to talk about their backgrounds freely because they think it will negatively affect their career,” she says. Most of the prejudice is unconscious – such as academics talking about “bog-standard comprehensives” and the need to invite “clubbable” people to university gatherings. Those who complain are accused of having a chip on their shoulder.More important, perhaps, is young working-class academics’ lack of economic, social and cultural capital. They don’t have a financial cushion to help them through postgraduate study, the hours of unpaid research needed to get published in a scholarly journal, and the short-term, poorly paid contracts now common at the start of an academic career.“Universities are increasingly putting time limits on completing PhDs,” Van Bueren says, “which makes it harder for those who have to work while studying.”Young academics may also be handicapped by not knowing how to write a CV or who to use as a referee. Even the academic style of discourse may be difficult to master. “Academia is very theoretical,” Van Bueren says. “People like me come from backgrounds where people resolved problems with their hands.”Van Bueren is not alone in raising such issues. One academic wrote that, as a university lecturer, he found it harder to come out about his working-class origins than to come out as gay. Others have reported difficulties in doing the social and professional networking – at international conferences, for example – that is often necessary to become fully established in an academic career.Van Bueren has observed in the past that, while gender ersity in university faculties has increased, class ersity has, if anything, declined. Feminism and ersity are celebrated, but there is no equivalent celebration of working-class intellectuals. Van Bueren decided her to become a human rights lawyer at age 11, after reading the inside cover of Babi Yar, a novel based on the massacre of 33,000 Jews in Ukraine in 1941. “I thought I wouldn’t want this to happen to anyone else,” she says. Her own Jewish family suffered relentless persecution: her maternal grandparents walked from the Lithuanian-Polish border to the English Channel in the early 20th century, while all but one of her Dutch father’s family were murdered in Auschwitz.So how difficult was it to achieve her ambition? She played truant from school, immersing herself in the local library, because teachers told her that, with her background, she wouldn’t be able to read law. “I thought that if they didn’t believe in me, I would be better off teaching myself,” she says.Her parents told her that if she had piano lessons, money might not be available to support her through post-compulsory education. Her father opposed her plans to do a PhD at Trinity College, Cambridge, following her master’s at University College London, and said she should study to become a barrister because that entailed clearer income prospects. She agreed to do so because he was dying of cancer.She was not brought up in grinding poverty, however. The family earned enough to make a small means-tested contribution to her student maintenance grant and she hardly lacked cultural capital. “There were books in the home,” she says. “My father, though he left school at 14, was well read and bought the Observer.”When she went to Cardiff University for her first degree, “I loved it, literally from the first day … It was the 1960s. There was a feeling of openness, that anything was possible.”Shouldn’t we worry more about the paucity of academics who come from families in what is sometimes called the “precariat” or the “underclass” – people on zero-hours contracts, for example, who frequently endure spells on zero income, or families that depend on benefits?Van Bueren says she doesn’t use terms such as “underclass”, preferring “terminology that encapsulates people’s dignity”. “Working class” apparently does that, though some social scientists would say the term is obsolete.A former lead commissioner on the Equality and Human Rights Commission, she wants to bring class discrimination, alongside discrimination on grounds of race and gender, into equalities legislation.Don’t we need a more precise definition of working class? “We need to define class, not just working class, in the way other forms of statutory discrimination are defined – through case law.

The results are mainly used to monitor school effectiveness by the Department for Education (DfE), with a more detailed breakdown of results to follow later in the year.But teaching unions remain opposed to the tests because of the stress they cause for teachers and pupils.“Sats results and league tables provide nothing more than a snapshot of how children performed on a particular day, in a few short tests, in a limited number of subjects. We should therefore avoid celebrating too loudly or berating too strongly schools that rise or fall,” said Nick Brook, the deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT).The testing of children to measure school performance has become a controversial political issue, with Jeremy Corbyn telling teachers in April that a Labour government would abolish Sats in England. The Liberal Democrats had previously pledged to abolish the tests at key stage 2 along with school league tables.Brook said the NAHT supported the abolition of the tests: “Sats tell teachers and parents little that they don’t already know about their child or school, but have the negative unintended consequences of distracting from teaching and learning and narrowing the focus of the curriculum.”In recent years some schools have run Easter holiday revision sessions, while parents have complained that schools devote too much time to Sats preparation.Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the results meant a third of pupils would be entering secondary education in September branded as below standard.“This demoralising outcome is the result of policymakers’ delusion that to measure the performance of our primary school system it is necessary to test each inidual pupil,” Courtney said.The DfE said failing to reach the expected standard did not mean those pupils were unable to read or count. “There’s a spectrum of attainment among pupils who do not meet the expected standard, with some coming close and others further away,” the department said.More Than a Score, a group that campaigns against Sats, said the results came at a heavy price for pupils. “Many of those pupils will have spent months focusing on just English and maths to prepare for Sats. They will have missed out on a broad and stimulating curriculum at a critical point in their education,” said Sara Tomlinson, a spokesperson for the group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2cbe348b0198d074e7f1ea41fc89f4b871b00df/0_363_1155_693/master/1155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94e43d12f68aee848daa8bbb14cf28fa","title":"on the move all the apps and websites you need to boss moves and flatshares","story":"Get the stress of moving under control with just a few taps on your smartphonePacking your bags and heading off to uni is one of those key life moments, when you feel you’re stepping into proper adulthood.

Those that they do catch are dirty. If you open up their gills, you can see that the inside is black.”Against the cafe’s chatter, Lobna Ben Ali Bouazza nods in agreement. “When I was a child, my parents would let us play on the beach here all day, swimming in the sea – everything. These used to be the best beaches around. Now I take my children elsewhere.”Outside the cafe, the residents of La Goulette, a small fishing suburb to the north of Tunis, go about their business. It’s the first few days of June and the beaches are relatively empty. A few couples drift across the sand, while upturned fishing boats lie idly in the noonday sun. These beaches will be unrecognisable in the summer, as families from throughout greater Tunis, looking to escape the soaring temperatures, take the shuttle train across the capital’s lake, past the industrial ports of Rades, and on to the beaches, where their scattershot encampments jockey for space over the crowded sands.Tunisia’s pollution issues aren’t new. Its heavy industries have been impacting water quality for years. However, since the revolution of 2011, conversation over the environmental impact of its industrial legacy has at least become possible, even if the kind of reversals activists are calling for remain some way off.Officially around a quarter of Tunisia’s waste water is recycled, intended, among other things, to irrigate the country’s farmlands. The rest (around 247m cubic metres a year), is expelled from the country’s treatment plants directly into the sea and inland waterways. According to environmental regulations, industrial waste water should initially be treated at source, before being transferred for further treatment. However, campaigners question how rigorously this is being enforced.There are three hulking water treatment plants servicing the population around the Gulf of Tunis, at Raoued, to the north-west of the Gulf, Rades, near La Goulette on the western side and Souliman, at the gulf’s industrialised southern reaches.All are operated by Onas (L’Office National de l’Assainissement), a subision of the ministry of the environment and sustainable development and, according to activists, heavily subsidised by loans from international bodies.“It’s crazy,” Morched Garbouj, president of the environmental pressure group SOS BIAA, tells the . “We tested the water going into these treatment plants and we tested it going out and, I can tell you, there’s very little difference.”Across Tunisia, industrial and domestic waste water is channelled from broad areas to large treatment plants. Within the Gulf, the outcomes are clear. “We tested both input and output flows between 2016 and 2017 and the results were consistent,” Garbouj, an environmental engineer, says. “We found increased levels of nitrates, manganese particles, phosphate plus faecal coliforms and streptococci – both present within human waste – among other matters. All of these are harmful to health.“The government has disputed these findings, but they haven’t shared their methodology with us, so it’s hard to say how credible those denials are.“Waste water treatment in Tunisia is entirely centralised. Everything goes through Onas, including the development loans from, say, the World Bank, the EU and the German Development Bank. We’ve taken our findings to them. They’re aware of what’s happening. They know it’s not working. They’re just not interested.“It seems no one really cares how well the treatment plants are performing. Onas, which runs the plants, is a subision of the ministry of the environment and, you know who’s responsible for testing their effectiveness? The ministry of the environment,” Garbouj says.Wafa Hmadi, a programme coordinator with the environmental group RAJ Tunisie is equally damning, “It isn’t just the Gulf of Tunis,” she tells the . She says that around the industrial town of Sfax, and Gabes – near the phosphate mining basin of Gafsa – whole stretches of coastline were “unusable”. “Many of Tunisia’s inland waterways are also affected by heavy industry, such as paper manufacturing. Pollutants from industry find their way out into the local environment, impacting local populations, before heading out to the sea. Fish, particularly larger fish, are dying. Some areas are just totally dead.“There really is hardly any monitoring. Industrial polluters can expel their waste largely untreated, as there are no inspections and no one is holding them accountable,” she says.Little of this is news for Lobna and Samir. They and their families have been living with the outcome of rising water pollution for years. However, in a country struggling with ingrained unemployment and desperate to fight back against an ever increasing cost of living, both are equally aware of the desperate need for industry and jobs.However, for a city built by the sea, change comes slowly. Outside the cafe, along the sun-drenched shoreline, children swim in the the cloudy waters, or e off the walls of La Goulette’s ancient canals as they have done for years.“People come here. They always will,” says Lobna.The Tunisian ministry of the environment has not responded to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb9566045223d6f61e3c64100106cb84d4842b02/0_322_6792_4075/master/6792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=273f524594af6493ab917c0d811a9730","title":"all hail celine dion the joyous new queen of fashion","story":"From perfectly sculpted to jaw-droppingly daring, the singer has reinvented herself as an avant-garde couture-star – and the fashion world can’t get enough of herIn 2019 we like our fashion heroes flamboyant yet enigmatic. Playful, but at the same time undeniably intimidating. Villanelle with raspberry-pink hair to match her Armani fur coat. Serena Williams at the French Open in a bespoke Virgil Abloh dress with the slogan: “Mother, Champion, Queen, Goddess.” Cardi B at the Met Gala, in a quilted crimson dress so huge she seemed to arrive on her own carnival float. Beyoncé in Homecoming.Céline Dion is the empress of them all. Right now, fashion is Céline’s world, and the rest of us just live in it. From the moment she stepped out of her car into a freak Parisian heatwave last Monday morning, dressed in a sculpted black gown with long, tight leather gloves, a glossy black headpiece that resembled an electrified bird of prey and open-toed booties, it was clear that Ms Dion had not come to haute couture week to play. She had come to slay. When she made her next entrance not just in full Gucci – peppermint and white puff-sleeved minidress, black bondage collar with silver spikes, lace tights and peep-toe shoes – but riding an electric scooter, the penny began to drop that this haute couture fashion week had in effect been rebranded as an extended pre-show entertainment to warm up the crowd for Dion’s headlining slot in Hyde Park. By the time she made what might, in a hotly contested field, go down in history as her best look of the week, in a grand Richard Quinn bow-topped gown, the cool tones of its electric blue and jade green floral perfectly set off by a pair of weimaraner dogs that Dion held nonchalantly by their diamante collars – the vibe in the front row was very much, print her face on our money already, for she is our queen.I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking that Dion has completely lost the plot – and, maybe, so have I. That Dion looks less like a woman of taste than a woman who has covered herself in glue and run through the VIP fitting room of every boutique on the Avenue Montaigne. And the thing is, you’re not completely wrong. Dion is not chic in any conventional sense. Her look is not easy on the eye, which is exactly what makes it interesting. It is the polar opposite of the Duchess of Cambridge school of pleasant, flattering, appropriate clothes. She makes no concession to the playbook of good taste, or the unspoken rules about what a 51-year-old woman should wear to catwalk shows that will be headlined by 18-year-old supermodels. (In Dion’s case, memorably, an Off-White “suit” comprising a one-piece, high-cut zippered graffiti-emblazoned swimsuit with a matching blazer, as seen just a few days earlier on Gigi Hadid.)Dion’s wardrobe is about drama – not just for its own sake, but as a narrative. She is her own muse, the heroine of her own story, and she gives herself all the best plotlines. Even when her looks are at their most jaw dropping – we haven’t even mentioned the second-skin unitard with C-H-A-N-E-L spelt out in gold hardware jangling from a chain belt – the most compelling thing about Dion is always the woman herself, not the clothes. In stark contrast to endless, soulless images of women posing in uncomfortable dresses on red carpets with rictus grins and hollow cheeks, looking like they would rather be anywhere else, or pouting with exaggerated boredom in a bathroom selfie, Dion always looks like she’s having the time of her life. This is a woman who really, really loves fashion. You can tell, not just because she clearly spends an eye-watering amount of time and money on clothes, but also because her exaggerated, sculptural camera-friendly poses are those of a woman who has soaked up a lifetime of fashion imagery. She stands for a photograph like one of the iconic couture models of the 1950s, with the swan-like neck of Jean Patchett and the angled hip of Suzy Parker, but adds the wink-to-camera knowingness of Elton John in his pomp. Along with her image-making team – “image architect” Law Roach, and stylists Sydney Lopez and Pepe Munoz – she collaborates with a wide range of designers, rather than being beholden to one label. With a personal fortune estimated by Forbes at $430m (£345m) she has no need to play the passive paper doll.Dion’s reinvention from bejazzled Vegas a to avant-garde Parisian street-style star began in 2016, the year in which she lost both her husband of 22 years and her brother to cancer. The deaths came within two days of each other. Later that year, a paparazzi shot of her wearing a neon-yellow Balenciaga gown caught the attention of the fashion industry, and she became a more frequent sight on the front row. Dion’s relationship with fashion feels much more than transactional. It feels, in fact, like a bit of a love affair. She gave a standing ovation to a Giambattista Valli collection and was moved to tears at a Valentino show last year. She takes pleasure in its beauty and its silliness. When she began working with Roach two years ago, he was excited to find his new client enthusiastic about the fashion potential of mining her own pop-culture background for street-style jokes. When Roach tentatively showed Dion a Vetements “Titanic” sweatshirt, her reaction was: “What do you mean, what do I think about it? I love it. I want to wear it today,” Roach told the  last year. Last week, Dion wore another Vetements X Titanic look: a replica of the film’s iconic Heart of the Ocean diamond, over a T-shirt reading I Love Paris Hilton. In May, for an encore after her epic Met Gala appearance in champagne-toned Oscar de la Renta fringing and peacock feathers, she greeted the photographers outside her hotel in a back-to-front Maison Margiela blazer – spoofing her own 1999 Oscars look, minus the white cowboy hat.Last month, Dion’s 16-year residency in Las Vegas came to an end. Having changed the rules of Vegas – Jon Gray, the general manager of the Palms Casino Resort, told the Daily Beast that “Vegas was a place where singers go to die. Céline changed that” – she is now changing the rules of the front row. A recent post on her Instagram showing her wearing an Alexandre Vauthier dress – sumptuous whipped folds of vanilla ice-cream silk, knicker-length hemline, floor-sweeping sleeves – was captioned “Channeling the inner goddess in all of us – Team Céline.” Amen to that. We may not all be in haute couture, but we are all Team Céline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1576779a5589b48c6d31fefb53be3a2ab1179e6/0_107_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e8fc6266179779bf5ad16aaa8c8f940","title":"sarah jessica parker reports on set harassment npr","story":"Sex and the City star comments on NPR about impact of #MeToo and reveals harassment by a ‘big movie star’Sarah Jessica Parker has spoken about “countless” incidents of men behaving inappropriately on film and TV productions, including one with a “big movie star” that was only resolved after her agent threatened she would walk off the set.In an interview on the NPR show Fresh Air, the Sex and the City star commented on the impact of the #MeToo campaign and said: “It really wasn’t … until about six or eight months ago that I started recognising countless experiences of men behaving poorly, inappropriately … I don’t know why I either wasn’t courageous or more destroyed by some of the things that I was privy to, that I was on the receiving end of.”Parker often felt intimidated, to the extent that she did not feel able to confront her harasser. “No matter how evolved or how modern I thought I was ...

But can he survive the extraordinary decline of the ice-cream van?You are only allowed to play the ice-cream jingle for a maximum of 12 seconds, when the van is approaching its destination. But Tony Roach flicks off the Popeye tune after only a moment’s airtime. “That wasn’t 12 seconds!” I wail. Roach blinks and looks at me oddly, then promises to play it for longer next time. There’s something about ice-cream vans that brings out the child in all of us.I’m riding shotgun in a pink-and-cream 2009 Whitby Morrison Millennium, accompanying Roach on the same round of Eastbourne, his hometown, that he has been doing for 40 years. The weather is warm, the sky is cloudless. Humming the Popeye tune under my breath, I help myself to another flake from the box above the fridge. It’s going to be a good day.Known to all as Ice-Cream Tony, 57-year-old Roach learned to scoop practically before he could walk. His father, Paul, was in the trade. “All I can remember is ice-cream vans,” says Roach. “From the age of six, I was going with my dad in the ice-cream van and helping. It’s all I wanted to do.” Paul taught him how to repair the refrigeration units and the engine. Most mechanics won’t touch ice-cream vans because they are complex vehicles, so, like an astronaut going into space, you have to be prepared to fix everything yourself. After his father died, Roach restored his 1972 Bedford CF Morrison van. It was an emotional task. “He was a great geezer. An ice-cream man through and through.”We pull up at our first stop, Roselands infant school, where parents are loitering outside. Roach switches off the engine and we sit there with the hum of the Carpigiani soft-serve machine for company. I feel like a lion watching my prey. The bell rings. Children flood out.Watching Roach spring into action is marvellous. If, as Malcolm Gladwell claimed, it takes 10,000 hours to achieve mastery in any given field, then Roach – who works seven days a week from the February half-term until October, 6am to 11pm – is a master 10 times over. He is the grandmaster of soft-serve Don Whippy King Cone.But fewer people are buying ice-cream than I thought. It’s murder at the infant school, and the primary school further down the road, and the third stop, a local park. In two hours, we sell maybe 20 ice-creams in total. At the park, Roach is anxious to tell me that, the day before, the queue was 20 minutes long.It’s not that the product is bad – it’s delicious. Roach uses a fresh milk mix from Mediterranean Ices, and is snobbish about providers who make their ice-cream from UHT. “I can always taste a UHT mix. You notice it when they’re walking away from the ice-cream van. You see how it runs down the edges? It’s melting. That doesn’t happen with fresh mix.” I look down at the cone I’ve been holding absent-mindedly, and he’s right – no drip.But people don’t have as much money to spend as before. Outside Stafford school, a child whines that his cone isn’t big enough. “That’s all the money we have,” says his mother, exasperated. “I’m not having anything for myself!” Later, at the Kingsmere estate, 40-year-old Christina Ward looks at the menu and says: “It’s well expensive, isn’t it?” Roach’s kindly mien slips for a moment behind his wraparound shades. “It’s only £2,” he retorts. Ward relents and buys three cones.Although Roach’s products are keenly priced – £2 for a small cone with flake, up to £3 for a large – if you have a few kids, that’s not much change from a tenner. Almost everyone buys small cones now, whereas before they would buy big ones, says Roach. “Since Brexit, people have less money, and less confidence in spending money. They haven’t got the money in their pockets they had a few years ago.” (Eastbourne voted to leave the EU.) As sales falter, Roach has ersified away from street trading, towards events, which are more lucrative.Turning ice-cream vans into a novelty for corporate dos and wedding receptions is a social loss after so many years spent chugging around suburban streets, Roach is part of the fabric of his community. He knows Eastbourne’s circadian rhythms: what time the schools get out, when families eat their tea and where children play outside (if they play outside at all – the period after teatime used to be his busiest, but now kids stay in).Often, as punters approach the van, he tells me their orders. “He’s going to ask for three medium cones with a flake,” Roach says of one older gentleman in a check shirt. (He does.) We serve 17-year-old Brendan Brooks, whose mother bought from Roach as a young girl. In Langley, retired train driver John Carney, 66, has been a customer for 20 years. “He brings the kids out, and they can see each other, because nowadays we don’t let children outside, they’re inside being cocooned ... And the mums and dads come out, so it’s a chance for us to have a chat, too.”From his vantage point on Eastbourne’s quiet cul-de-sacs, Roach sees social change up close – such as how people don’t carry cash any more. “Two or three years ago, if someone said I’d be taking cards, I wouldn’t believe it! But now you have to.” He’s an expert on Britain’s changing palates. Recently, people have started asking for vegan ice-cream. Roach doesn’t have any, but he does have dog ice-cream – not because dogs are more deserving than vegans, but because he did a dog show last week. Roach has observed more worrying trends, too, such as the climate emergency. “We’re having different weather than we had 20 years ago,” he says darkly. “The weather’s changing ... we get very hot spells and then very wet spells.” The Goldilocks weather for selling ice-cream, incidentally, is 21C, says Roach: “That’s just nice. I don’t like it too hot ... people can get a bit grumpy when it’s too hot.”But as our summers buzz longer and hotter, there is one constant: we Brits absolutely love soft-serve ice-cream. “People’s tastes change. But they can’t resist a 99.” Mr Whippy is British culture. “Other countries just don’t get it. It’s a British thing. It’ll be raining on a bank holiday, but we’ll still have an ice-cream. It’s one of those things only British people understand.”Soft-serve ice-cream is actually an American import. Mister Softee came to the UK in the 50s, but it wasn’t long before we concocted a homegrown rival, Mr Whippy, which was founded in Birmingham in 1958. Mr Whippy is the ultimate leveller, beloved by celebrities – Roach has served Piers Morgan and Davina McCall – and ordinary folk alike. Tony Blair wrote in his 2010 biography, A Journey, about being forced by spin doctors to buy cones for himself and Gordon Brown during the 2005 election trail. (Blair is not a fan.)Mr Whippy is elemental nostalgia. “Bing-bong, bingety bongety bong,” wrote Simon Schama in a 2007 Vogue essay. “Mr Whippy is calling, and we, short-trousered, snake-belted, grimy-kneed, snot-nosed, want what he’s got. We want a 99, God, how we want it.” You only need to hear the opening bars of Greensleeves and you’re nine years old again, scrambling for change then bolting barefoot out of the door. “Every time you heard that song played, even when you were little, you knew he was there,” says 44-year-old restaurant worker Stephen Humphreys, handing his daughter Aaliyah a cone. He bought from Roach as a child. “Quick, get the money together, leg it there before he goes.”Being an ice-cream man has kept Roach young. He credits his sprightliness to eating ice-cream every day for 40 years. He rarely goes on holiday, but when he does, the first thing he does is have a local ice-cream. (“It’s always rubbish. Not as good as mine.”) In winter, Roach restores vintage vans – he has a fleet of 12. At the beachfront, we bump into his wife, Yvonne – they have been married for 25 years. She confirms that ice-cream is not just a livelihood for Roach – he picked her up for their first date in the van. A self-styled “ice-cream widow”, Yvonne says Roach was meant to retire at 50, but keeps putting it off. “It’s never going to happen, and I’ve accepted it.” Yvonne asks her husband for a cone. “I hope you’ve got some money on you!” he says.During a lull, Roach shows me the trick to making the perfect Mr Whippy: you rotate the cone in a circle, then pull it away from the machine to create the point. (I am lousy.) At the Kingsmere estate, we sell three ice-creams and a slush puppy to 51-year-old reiki master Russell Dobson. “When they hear the noise,” Dobson says, gesturing to his son, “you tell them: ‘There’s none left.’” “You can’t do that!” Roach exclaims. “That’s what everyone tells them,” Dobson says. “Did you not know that?” (Later, at a playground, a girl of about five or six runs up to the van and asks if we’ve sold out. When Roach shakes his head, she looks confused, then enraged.)The day draws on and Roach and I drive through quietening residential streets, past pebbledash houses and trampolines and garden gnomes. There are mums with prams, dads in tracksuits and flip-flops, children in school uniforms on scooters – so many scooters, more scooters than I’ve ever seen before. Women come out of houses in bathrobes with wet hair and buy ice-cream to take indoors.Tony Roach holds Eastbourne together with engine grease and dairy cream. Like his father before him, he is an ice-cream man through and through – but he may well be among the last. Roach is at the heart of a dying trade, and a rapidly melting community. It occurs to me that this may be the fictitious Arcadia that Brexiters want: communities where the ice-cream man knows your name and your order, and your mother’s order before yours, and her grandmother’s order before that, probably. They have been searching for it, but it’s already here. This summer, at least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/449b56436ad921eb74bc3dee032cb66e47b12b0b/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ced3d15345bd2b1dc0c4915dd813ae09","title":"flying feet tattoos and chicken masks copa america 2019 in pictures","story":"Five years after hosting the World Cup, Brazil again was home to a major competition this time the Copa América with 12 teams competing over 26 matches.

Countries must commit to investing more in education now so that we do not break the global promise made to today’s children and youth,” said Clark, who is chair of the Global Education Monitoring Report advisory board.- Incentives for girls to complete primary education before reaching puberty, when marriage and pregnancy can interrupt schooling- There are now more girls than boys going to primary school- Only country surveyed that showed advances in adult literacy rates- On course to triple primary completion rates from 2000 to 2030- Dramatic increase in spend per primary child, from $13child in 2002-2004 to $186child in 2017\u0026nbsp- Increase in aid for education. Canada has funded, for example, more village-based schools to reduce the distance pupils have to travel, which was found to increase attendance of girls in particular- Many teachers left the country or took other work following a 14-year civil war and school closures during the Ebola outbreak- Fewer than half of current primary school teachers are trainedGordon Brown, former prime minister and the UN’s special envoy on global education, said: “Once again new projections by Unesco show that we are failing our youth by not guaranteeing access to quality education … We need to do more to support and encourage countries to commit to education, which is key to healthy societies.”In 2018 Brown launched the $10bn (£8bn) International Finance Facility for Education, backed by the UN and the World Bank. He emphasised the need to continue to develop new streams of financing “to provide the means to invest and reform education systems. There is no time to waste.”Unesco’s snapshot of the global state of education also highlights ongoing inequalities.Many governments are adopting policies to try to meet their commitments, including in early and life-long learning, but funding remains an issue.A report on the second sustainable development goal, Zero Hunger, will be launched on 15 July, and the forum concludes with ministerial meetings from 16-18 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/790dc6cf26b7cb4242bacdb07310df216eb2a5e0/0_119_720_432/master/720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a7d8225049490313c9c199590248e07","title":"how we met i ran up to her car window and she couldnt remember how to open it","story":"Ian Rickett, 31, a farmer, and Elsa Trueman, 27, who works at the National Holocaust Centre and Museum, live in Nottinghamshire. They met at a Young Farmers’ Club meetingElsa and Ian first met at the pre-schoolers’ group their mothers attended, although Elsa, four years younger than Ian, was just a baby. Then they were at the same school, but didn’t know each other. And although Elsa had grown up on a farm just 10 minutes from Ian’s village, where his parents have a smallholding, they never socialised. She had never been particularly interested in joining the Young Farmers’ Club that Ian was involved in.That changed when Elsa came home after university and wanted to make some new local friends. It was November 2017 and she went to her first Young Farmers’ meeting – the group’s AGM, and Ian’s last night as chairman. “I saw her and that was just it, really. I thought: ‘Oh right, hello,’” he says.He saw her leave at the end and ran after her. “She’d just got in her car. I ran up to her window, and she couldn’t remember how to open it. I stood there doing the old ‘wind it down’ thing.”“It didn’t have a winder,” says Elsa.Ian continues: “So she opens the door straight into my face. That was it. We swapped phone numbers that night. I just said: ‘A few of us are going to the pub it would be nice if you joined us, meet a few people.’”Elsa didn’t go, but they spent the week texting each other and a week later, they met for a date. Ian works long hours on a farm so it was late when they got to Rufford Abbey country park, in Nottinghamshire at midnight they were still walking round the lake.Since then, they say, they have been inseparable. “Whenever any of my friends meet Ian they say if they could draw a picture to describe what my perfect partner would be, Ian is exactly that,” says Elsa. “Ian is really kind I don’t think I’ve met anyone as kind as him. He just gives off an aura of happiness.” Ian likes that they “have the same level of humour, the same values”.They are doing up a cottage they managed to buy at auction but the dream is to run a farm together. “I said: ‘I’d like a bit of land, some tractors, some animals, my own business,’” says Ian. “I expected Elsa to say: ‘I’m not having that,’ but she said: ‘I like the sound of that.’ So that’s what we’re aiming for, putting a bit away and saving up.” Elsa says: “My parents have got a farm. I’ve got two sisters, but neither of them are interested in farming, so I think my dad was quite happy when he knew Ian was a farmer.”They got engaged in August last year. Elsa does modelling part-time, often shooting covers for romantic or period novels, which Ian gets roped into doing, too (“All of a sudden I’m dressed as Henry VIII,” he says). Ian got one of the photographers to help with the proposal, setting up a fake shoot at the country park where they had their first date. “On the day, it was raining a bit so we were driving to this shoot, and Ian was getting more and more worked up,” says Elsa. “I was like: ‘It’s fine – the worst that can happen is we’ll cancel the shoot.’”They set a picnic scene below an oak tree, and when Elsa turned around, Ian was holding a ring. “And he gave me a little speech,” she says. Ian continues: “About how much I love her and how much she means to me. She looked me square in the eyes and said: ‘Is this a prop?’”“I thought it wasn’t real,” she says. “I thought: ‘I’m going to say yes and he’s going to laugh at me.’”They are getting married in a few weeks in Ian’s village, followed by a blessing in the church in Elsa’s village down the road, then a reception on the farm. They will probably be travelling by tractor.Want to share your story?

The other makes spectacular shows out of Sellotape. Philip Glass and Phelim McDermott talk about their new work about loss and religion – with puppets‘I’ve done very good collaborations with people I don’t know very well,” says Philip Glass. “Even with people I didn’t like very much.” Sitting in La MaMa, the experimental theatre in New York’s East Village, one of the founders of minimalist music is talking about a body of work that includes three symphonies based on David Bowie’s Berlin albums, two sci-fi operas with Doris Lessing, an orchestrated version of Icct Hedral by Aphex Twin – and that’s only scratching the surface.Now 82, Glass has found another collaborator, one who “has a comfortable relationship with his unconscious”, and who is bringing the composer’s unearthly music to a new generation. Already renowned for his Olivier award-winning adaptation of Shockheaded Peter and such outdoor shows as Sticky (which saw the construction of a 100ft tower using Sellotape), Phelim McDermott has directed three of Glass’s great operas – Satyagraha, about Gandhi The Perfect American, about Walt Disney and Akhnahten, about the pharaoh who briefly brought monotheism to Egypt.This week, the pair will debut a new work at the Manchester international festival. Called Tao of Glass, it explores their creative relationship: the old master and the younger fan. “It’s about my obsession with Philip’s music,” McDermott says, speaking in a cafe in London, near the offices of his Improbable theatre group. “The first show I ever made professionally, when I left Middlesex Poly, used music from Glassworks. I listened to that album obsessively when I was a student.”Tao of Glass owes its origins to the children’s author Maurice Sendak. Glass and McDermott had hoped to create an opera based on In the Night Kitchen, Sendak’s book about a boy almost getting baked in a cake. The pair visited him at his house in rural Connecticut to hatch some plans. “We’ve got to do this show before I die!” Sendak told them – but sadly he did die, shortly afterwards, in 2012.That put an end to their adaptation of In the Night Kitchen, a crushing experience for both McDermott and Glass. “When you’ve lost a piece, it can be devastating, like the loss of a child,” says the composer, a father of four. Tao of Glass both is – and is about – the work McDermott and Glass decided to make instead. It will consist of 10 scenes set to music by Glass, performed by McDermott and several puppets: some created from paper or objects to evoke a dream world others expressing the essence of Glass and his music and a more traditional puppet of a child that represents McDermott as a boy, as his son, and as a character from a dream show that never gets made.Tao of Glass also asks where inspiration comes from. Glass is sure it originates in the subconscious. “When I imagine music when I wake up in the morning, that means I’ve been dreaming about it. And then, with very little effort, I can connect that dream with projects I’ve been working on. But the actual connection happens in the part of your mind that doesn’t relate to the everyday world. Music doesn’t come from this world, it comes from the dream world.”Glass’s dreamlife must be as active as ever. This year alone, he has debuted a symphony, Lodger, based on the 1979 Bowie album, and created the music for Glenda Jackson’s second crack at King Lear on Broadway. Does he compose every day? “Pretty much, because I don’t have enough days, so I can’t afford …” he trails off. “I was just in Indianapolis, doing concerts, but I was writing during the day. I got back to New York at one o’clock on Sunday and by three, I was working, and I’ve been working every day since. That’s not uncommon. People who paint paint all the time. I knew Allen Ginsberg very well and he was writing constantly. Sometimes we were sharing quarters because we were at a retreat, and, in the middle of the night, he would wake up and write poetry.”Ginsberg, he says, would change his poems mid-performance, which would throw Glass off-balance when he was trying to accompany him. “I would say, ‘Allen, I can’t follow you when you do that.’ And he’d say, ‘What did I do?’ I’d say, ‘It’s like running after a rabbit and you’re never sure where the rabbit’s going to jump to next.’ We always had fun together. Phelim is very similar in the sense that he can draw on his unconscious very easily. That’s what you see when you’re looking at his work. But then people might say that about me and that’s probably true.”McDermott says he often gets his best ideas lying in a flotation tank – most notably, the one about getting the English National Opera chorus to juggle throughout much of Akhnaten. “Sometimes,” he laughs, “you get an idea and think, ‘That’s so stupid it will probably be really good.’” The chorus were duly given lessons by master juggler Sean Gandini. “In the end, they said, ‘This is helping us learn where we are in the music.’ So actually they really liked it.” The hypnotic, repetitive and incrementally unfurling nature of Glass’s music – not to mention a libretto largely sung in the languages of ancient Egypt – make it as hard to perform as it is gorgeous.As a young Glass fan, McDermott saw ENO’s European premiere of Akhnaten in London in 1985. After picking up his ticket, he says, he spotted the composer in the street and followed him around Covent Garden until Glass disappeared into a sushi restaurant. “I guess there was a fantasy – if I stopped him, what would I say? A little bit like when I saw Quentin Tarantino at a crime writers’ festival in Nottingham. On some level, Tao of Glass is me finally daring to stop Philip and ask him a question.”McDermott eventually met Glass after Seán Doran, then ENO’s artistic director, suggested he direct Einstein on the Beach, whose visionary original production was created by Glass and director Robert Wilson. “I was like, ‘What? That’s a really stupid idea.’ It’s such an extraordinary piece, it’s like a crazy dream.” Nonetheless, McDermott went for lunch in New York with Glass, who told him: “Your genuine reluctance makes me think you should do it.” Instead, McDermott directed Satyagraha.Opera, says McDermott, suits his seat-of-the-pants approach. “You’ve got a chorus, an orchestra, some singers with extraordinary talent and personalities, and a set that could kill people if it hits them on the head. You rehearse, you’ve got three days with the orchestra, a dress rehearsal and then you do the show. It’s like doing a big outdoor gig. You have to go, ‘Well, the crane comes through here, the audience will hopefully walk through here and the fireworks will go off there.’ You have to create an environment in which all these things come into conversation with each other.”There is a spiritual dimension to Tao of Glass, as the title suggests. Glass once described himself as “a Jewish Taoist Hindu Toltec Buddhist”. McDermott, meanwhile, is interested in Taoism: “It’s basically a belief that nature has a process and a flow that you’re either in alignment with or you’re fighting.” He believes in it “in the sense that making shows, creatively, hasn’t been anything to do with me. Somehow I’ve managed to get out of my own way. In the rehearsals for Tao of Glass we would throw the I Ching every now and again. Generally, the message I get is, ‘Stop trying to be in control.’ Which of course is the hardest thing in the world.”It’s McDermott’s first time at MIF, something especially significant as he’s a Mancunian who grew up watching shows at the Royal Exchange, where Tao of Glass will be staged. “I used to sit and watch Max Wall doing Waiting for Godot – some extraordinary performances. The dream was, ‘I’ll direct things here.’ But it never really happened. So I gave up on that dream and now it’s come back. The Tao decided that it does happen, but not in the way you think. At first I thought it would be In the Night Kitchen but now it’s me. So I’ll be there, and my 15-year-old self will be there as a ghost.”Another ghost will be Glass, who won’t be on stage but present in spirit, especially if McDermott manages to pull off another dream – to get Steinway to produce a piano that can record Glass playing the keys, and then at the touch of a button play compositions back, with the keys moving just as Glass touched them.Meanwhile, McDermott is set to take Akhnaten to the Met in New York in November – and then, he believes, he will finally be ready to tackle Einstein on the Beach. There’s also the big dream: that Glass’s three “portrait operas” (Satyagraha, Akhnaten, Einstein) can be presented for the first time somewhere as a Ring-style marathon. “These operas are terrifying because you go, ‘There’s this scene. What actually happens? Anything?’ And then you do things you could never normally do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a76d80e489963ae45bcb555f88ec2b9a863a7ace/150_355_3108_1865/master/3108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=262f7d605e02781db0703192ab9b5fd8","title":"what really happens to the waste in your recycling bin podcast","story":"Recycling is often cited as one of the easiest ways to make a difference to the environment.

He defended Labour’s position over the past three years, saying it had been right to respect the result of the 2016 referendum.“Labour set out a compromise plan to try to bring the country together based around a customs union, a strong single market relationship and protection of environmental regulations and rights at work. We continue to believe this is a sensible alternative that could bring the country together,” Corbyn said.With Labour under intense pressure from more overtly pro-remain parties, including the Liberal Democrats, the party had already shifted since the European elections towards urging the Conservatives to put their deal to a public vote. But Corbyn had previously stopped short of saying Labour would campaign for remain in the event of a referendum being called.In an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, he said there was no decision yet as to what Labour would argue for in a general election on Brexit. He said: “We will decide very quickly at the start of that campaign exactly what our position will be.”Pressed on whether Labour was now a party of leave or remain, Corbyn said: “We will give people the choice on this. That is something which is surely very important. We respect the result of the referendum. We’ve been through this whole long parliamentary process over the past three years and we’ve made it very clear we will do everything we can to take no deal off the table or stop a damaging deal of the sort Hunt and Johnson are proposing.”Corbyn believes the fact that both sides of the party have signed up to the new policy vindicates his approach of moving gradually, and only after extensive consultation.Labour also hopes that it can now set aside the Brexit row, and gain more of a hearing for other domestic policies.Differences in the shadow cabinet over Brexit policy have repeatedly been played out in public in recent months, with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, joining calls for his party to adopt a remain stance.The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, was dropped from deputising for Corbyn at prime minister’s questions after criticising the party’s position during TV coverage of the European election results. “We were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear,” she said.Corbyn’s deputy, Tom Watson, has publicly urged party members to make their disquiet about Labour’s position known by signing up to a remain “declaration”.But their fellow shadow cabinet members Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery have repeatedly expressed concerns about the idea of supporting remain in a referendum, fearing it will undermine Labour’s support in leave-voting constituencies at the next general election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08dfc9cb2831731acfc4fd66f4067a30ef75ba89/0_142_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db827c4469bc16c50de450982d4cf684","title":"speaker dominic grieve no deal brexit john bercow","story":"John Bercow rules MPs will not discuss amendment to stop parliament being proroguedThe Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has not selected the main amendment designed to scupper attempts by a future government to force a no-deal Brexit by proroguing parliament, frustrating the efforts of backbench MPs led by the Conservative Dominic Grieve.But two other amendments, seeking to extend the rights of abortion and equal marriage to Northern Ireland, have been picked for votes on Tuesday evening and if passed could prove a constitutional headache for the government.The amendments were among more than a dozen tabled to a largely technical bill about Northern Ireland, the body of which is intended to delay elections to the long-suspended devolved assembly and deal with associated budgetary matters.MPs will get a chance to vote on other amendments tabled by Grieve intended to make prorogation more difficult, such as one that would oblige ministers to report every two weeks in October on efforts to restore the Northern Ireland executive.The intention of that would be to require the Commons to be in session to hear the reports, but it is unclear whether a government pushing for no-deal could simply ignore this, even though this could then be challenged in court.Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues Parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen\u0027s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills which have been passed during that session, and summarises what has been achieved.It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.\u0026nbspParliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen\u0027s Speech at the formal State Opening of Parliament.Grieve, supported by opposition parties and a handful of pro-EU Conservatives, laid an amendment that would have stopped parliament being prorogued in the autumn to achieve a no-deal Brexit. Prorogation has been mooted by some Brexiters as a way of stopping the Commons blocking no deal.But Grieve’s was not among those picked. Selecting amendments is entirely at the discretion of the Speaker, and it is possible Bercow ruled against Grieve’s amendment as it was not directly connected to the bill.An amendment tabled by Labour’s Conor McGinn stipulates that same-sex marriage, which is permitted in all parts of the UK apart from Northern Ireland, would automatically become legal there within three months if the devolved government remains stalled. It has been signed by almost 30 cross-party MPs.Another amendment, tabled by Labour’s Stella Creasy, argues that the government is obliged to extend the right of abortion to comply with UN human rights obligations. This has been signed by more than 80 MPs, including seven Conservatives, giving it a good chance of passing.The government officially supports extending both equal marriage and abortion to Northern Ireland but argues that it must be a matter for the devolved executive, which has been suspended amid political deadlock since January 2017 with no immediate hope of restoration.McGinn has sought to get around these objections by stressing that if the executive and assembly were brought back, they could either endorse or reverse the decision on equal marriage.

Having spent more than 30 years as an activist in the ecology and the sustainability movement, the Green MEP for the south-west region feels the UK is finally starting to appreciate the scale of the climate emergency. “People are suddenly waking up to it, which is very exciting for someone like me who’s been banging on about this for years,” she says.Take aviation. “We’re really getting a grip on that now. That was something where I was really out of line with other people. But in the last year, people have stopped thinking that I’m a loony not flying anywhere. They start by being admiring and then they start thinking ‘Oh God, I’m going to have to start doing that’. We’ve reached that point, it’s really encouraging.”However, Scott Cato, who is also the Green party’s spokeswoman for EU relations, the economy and finance, and stopped flying in 2003, is exasperated at the government’s stance on airport expansion. Barely a week after the prime minister declared a climate emergency, the government published detailed plans for a third runway at Heathrow. “It’s really damaging if people just say this stuff and then carry on as usual. They must be committed to doing something, it mustn’t just be hypocritical empty words.”“The positive side is that every time they come forward with a proposal, whether it’s Heathrow, or another road-building scheme, we can say, ‘Well, you said zero carbon by 2050, you said there was a climate emergency’.”She strongly believes that reducing emissions is a crucial way to reduce inequality. “The crucial thing about the transition to a carbon-neutral economy is social justice. If you think about why people voted for Brexit, it’s because they felt they were being left behind. Their resentment is being attached to climate denialism, by very irresponsible politicians who whip up resentment caused by austerity. They connect that and say ‘Now you’re telling me I can’t have my car’. But that’s not what we’re saying at all.Scott Cato wants the UK, along with other industrialised countries, to take greater responsibility internationally. That means “constraining the ability of the wealthiest to escape the consequences of what they’ve done to the planet with their greed. If you’re talking about climate apartheid, you’re talking about people in Bangladesh or the horn of Africa whose lives are being made impossible because of our historic emissions.”So what would she do? “Because we had the industrial revolution which caused the historic emissions that are now making their lives impossible, the least we can do is hand them the clean technologies we’ve now got for free to recompense.”Scott Cato, 56, dates her ecological roots to her time at university in the mid-1980s. “I didn’t know in 1985 that there was such a political thing as a ‘green’,” she says. But a Chilean friend saw that her politics was about natureand her connection to the Earth. “Everywhere in the world there are greens, and what makes them green is the fact that your politics comes from this deep connection to planet Earth. It’s an extraordinary feeling to know you’re part of a global movement, that you’re connected to the planet we all share.”Later, in the 90s, she did an economics PhD (“while struggling to feed three children until working families tax credits came along”, she recalls), and then, in 2012, became the world’s first professor of green economics at the University of Roehampton. This entailed thinking of the economy in terms both of society’s place in the ecosystem, but also social justice, sustainable trade policy and welfare, she explains.In addition to the economic arguments, Scott Cato says there are significant social justice advantages of a universal basic income. “I think it’s right that citizens have a stake in their society and should have security without having to sell their labour. Why should the wealthy have the freedom to develop their potential and the poor just get stuck on to a treadmill? It’s wrong.”A member of the Green party since 1988, Scott Cato’s political rise began in 2011, when she was elected a Green party councillor for Stroud district council. The following year she became group leader, and an electoral agreement led to a shared administration run by Labour, Greens and Liberal Democrats since 2012. “It’s run cooperatively, but not in a formal coalition”.So what does she think councils need to do to tackle the climate emergency? “All public buildings should have solar panels,” she replies. In addition, she wants a national planning law to insist that all new buildings – residential and business – have to be zero-carbon or even net carbon negative by producing their own energy, and for local authorities to do more to enable people to work where they live. “Commuting is an incredible waste of energy,” she says. That means councils also need to do a lot more to promote community-supported agriculture. Why can’t local authorities make more land available for local food growth schemes, she asks. And councils need to reverse cuts to bus services, to reduce the reliance on cars, she adds.“Transport’s appalling in Stroud. Because I don’t have a car, my life ends at 6pm, and on Sunday I just have to enjoy my garden on my own. There are no buses in the evening. That’s absurd. It’s just saying to you ‘Get a car’ all the time.”Scott Cato is an unapologetic evangelist for the south-west and its sustainable credentials. “To me, the south-west is the deep-greeny part of the country,” she says. “Transition towns, that earthy-rooted green stuff has always come from the south-west. Real green politics is about connection to nature and why do some people choose to live in Bristol rather than London? Because they can get out to the countryside, why do they choose to live in Cornwall? Because they like that relationship with the sea.“If you look at the relationship between earnings and education, the south-west is full of very educated people who don’t earn that much. That suggests people who have chosen lifestyle over more cash. That’s a green life choice. If we’re going to move to a green society where we have much more happiness and use much less energy and fewer resources, then we need to bottle whatever it is that makes people in the south-west happier with less money.”Family: Two sons, one daughter.Education: Bath high school St Hugh’s College, Oxford (politics, philosophy, economics) University of Wales, Aberystwyth (economics PhD).Career: 2014-present: member, European parliament’s economic and monetary affairs, and agriculture and rural development, committees 2014-present: Green party member, South West Region, European parliament 2013-14: chair, audit and standards committee, Stroud district council 2012-14: professor, green economics, University of Roehampton 2012-14: leader, Green group, Stroud district council 2011-14: Green party councillor, Stroud district council 2009-12: director, Transition Stroud 2014: director, Stroud Common Wealth 2007-12: director, Cardiff Institute for Cooperative Studies, Cardiff politan University 2006-present: member, Stroud Community Agriculture cooperative 2001-12: senior lecturer and reader in green economics, Cardiff politan University 2000-01: tutor, Aberystwyth University 1992-98: founder and director, Green Audit consultancy 1990-2001: freelance copy editor, Oxford University Press 1987-88: desk editor, Oxford University Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51ab02d6e96e887ce0462350130feefb5f702be6/0_147_3522_2113/master/3522.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f41cc6ef6a43225e80879ef4eac8726d","title":"john daly out of open golf cart portrush","story":"The former champion John Daly has withdrawn from the Open Championship at Royal Portrush next week.Daly said initially that he would try to play “through the pain” of degenerative arthritis in his right knee after his request to use a golf cart was turned down by the R\u0026ampA on Saturday.However, the 53-year-old has since had a change of heart and has been replaced in the field by the American Kevin Streelman, with Rory Sabbatini now first reserve for the final major of the year ahead of Brian Harman and Martin Kaymer.Daly had been allowed to use a cart in the US PGA Championship in May under the Americans With Disabilities Act, although he missed the cut at Bethpage.But although the R\u0026ampA expressed sympathy with Daly over his condition, it said players “walking the course is an integral part of the Championship and is central to the tradition of links golf which is synonymous with the Open”.After receiving the news, Daly wrote on Twitter: “Quite disappointed they do not see it the same way our PGA of America and PGA Tour sees it.

My rain radar says it’ll continue to do so for perhaps another hour, and thus further play is unlikely until about 6pm BST. After that, though, it looks like there should be enough dry weather for a game to be completed. Albeit one that might make a lot of people quite angry.“Surely there’s no greater Commercial Consideration than ensuring India reached the World Cup Final?” says Abhijato Sensarma.It’s nearly not raining! With just a light drizzle now falling, a mop-up operation has begun (though the covers remain very much in place).Rain stopped play at 2.01pm, and only when more than two hours have been lost to rain are overs taken out of the game. As of five minutes ago, that threshold has been reached.Karan Singh Dogra is unhappy. “India bowled well and stopped scores,” he says. “It is not fair that India should score 148 in 20 overs. Same overs same runs should be applied. Play the game with the spirit of game.” Clearly that would be the most sporting outcome, and it strikes me that it would be immeasurably better for India to bat 50 overs tomorrow than 20 overs today. However, there will I’m sure be the dreaded Commercial Considerations to take into account.This just in from Andy Bull, our man at Old Trafford. It looks to me like good news for New Zealand, who stand to benefit from any resumption today:“The ICC are very keen to get this game done today if they can. Play can go on as late as 10pm tonight, because they’ve added a two-hour extension to the playing hours for the semi-finals. They need to start play by 8ish, but he rain is supposed to stop around 6 or 7 so I think we’ll get a game in. If India’s innings is reduced to 20 overs, they’ll need to chase 148. The target’s high, because New Zealand kept so many wickets in hand.”“As a NZ fan, this drawn-out defeat is tortuous - can we not just throw the towel in now? Won’t someone please think of the children?” pleads Giles. No Giles, no they will not. And no you can’t. You’re just going to have to live through it like the rest of us.“Is there potential for this rain to totally ‘SouthAfrica’ India?” wonders Si Begley. “India are set 148 off 20 today, go for it, reach 1407 after 15, heavens open, they have to come back tomorrow to chase 237? Would seem massively unfair. And incredibly funny.”There is no potential for such lunacy, happilysadly. As soon as a ball is bowled after an over reduction, those conditions are set and unchangeable. So if they try to play 20 overs today but play is stopped after two deliveries, they will play only 19.4 overs tomorrow.They can if necessary play until 8pm today, but 10.30am tomorrow is starting to look an increasingly likely resumption time.Weather update: it is pouring in Manchester.“This is insane,” wails Sreekanth Nandakumar. “So India have to score 6 runs or more if the match is reduced to 35 overs or less on a slow pitch? How is it fair?” Certainly the rain has come at a good time for New Zealand, though they only benefit if play resumes today with a reduced over count. Reporters on the scene have turned a bit pessimistic about the prospects of more play today:Here’s a more complete run-down of potential India targets:Assuming New Zealand’s innings ends here, India’s target in 46 overs would be 237. In 20 overs, which is the shortest it could be to qualify as a completed innings, their target would be 148. This is just over twice the total New Zealand had after 20 overs (which was 73-2).World Cup regulations state that “every effort will be made to complete the match on the scheduled day with any necessary reduction in overs taking place and only if the minimum number of overs necessary to constitute a match cannot be bowled on the scheduled day will the match be completed on the reserve day”. From which we learn that the ICC are not big fans of punctuation.Hello everyone! Well, this is just great, is it not? The rain radar I’ve been looking at suggests that the weather is unlikely to significantly improve for at least a couple of hours, with around 6pm being a vaguely realistic amateur not-quite-total guess of a potential restart time. So settle in, we’re here for the long haul.There won’t be any play for a while, so I’m going to take an unscheduled lunch break. Simon Burnton is waiting to watch the weather on your behalf. See you soon.Don’t make any plans for tomorrow. The forecast for the rest of the day is imperfect.“NZ may have the game in the bag,” says Siraj Khan, “if they are able to play their entire 50 overs and hit 240.”That would be a very useful total. I think India will make the new ball count, though, and control the chase after that. If they get off to a slow start – 27 for one off 10, say – it’ll be very tight.There is scope for a reserve day, but the umpires will try to finish the game today if they can. So India could end up chasing a DLS target in a reduced game - 21 from 20 overs, something like that. You can read more about the reserve days here.46.1 overs: New Zealand 211-5 (Taylor 65, Latham 5) A misfield from Chahal gives Latham a bonus run. That’s the last ball of the innings, for now at least. The rain is getting heavier and the umpires have decided to take the players off.46th over: New Zealand 209-5 (Taylor 65, Latham 3) Latham gets two overthrows from the same delivery, one at each end. Virat Kohli’s face is a picture, and that picture will hurt you if you don’t stop looking at it. Seven from Bumrah’s antepenultimate over - five singles plus those two overthrows.45th over: New Zealand 202-5 (Taylor 60, Latham 1) Despite everything, all the dot balls and mistimed strokes , New Zealand are inching towards a reasonable score.Kumar ends a dangerous little partnership by dismissing Colin de Grandhomme. He produced a slower short ball which followed de Grandhomme, who tried to glide it to third man and got a little edge through to MS Dhoni. de Grandhomme made a useful 16 from 10 balls, adding 38 in 3.4 overs with Taylor.Ross Taylor has an LBW decision overturned on review! He missed a premeditated sweep at a full ball from Kumar and was given out by Richard Kettleborough. It looked plumb, and I suspect Taylor reviewed in hope rather than expectation, but replays showed it hit him outside the line.44th over: New Zealand 197-4 (Taylor 56, de Grandhomme 16) Good afternoon Mr Taylor, we’ve been expecting you. After struggling for so long, Ross Taylor comes alive and, with a little help from de Grandhomme, smashes 18 from Chahal’s final over. A vicious slog-sweep for six brings up a laboured, 73-ball fifty, and two balls later he crunches a drive for four. de Grandhomme cuts another boundary to complete a superb over. Chahal ends with figures of 10-0-63-1. “Sorry to be the bearer of bad news,” says John Norris, “but I live 25 miles to the west of Old Trafford and it’s raining steadily here so seems unlikely to miss the cricket today which could have severe implications for NZ after their lethargic run rate...”43rd over: New Zealand 179-4 (Taylor 44, de Grandhomme 12) The groundstaff are poised for action, which suggests rain is imminent. Pandya drops short to de Grandhomme, who steers the ball deftly to third man for four. Nine from the over, and the wounded Pandya finishes with figures of 10-0-55-1.42nd over: New Zealand 170-4 (Taylor 42, de Grandhomme 5) It’ll be interesting to see what the new batsman, the big-hitting Colin de Grandhomme, makes of this pitch. He has a swipe at Chahal, inside-edging past leg stump for two, during a decent over for New Zealand. They’d accept 220 now, and they’d thank Mother Cricket for it.41st over: New Zealand 162-4 (Taylor 40) Pandya must be a doubt for the final, should India get there. He’ll bowl his 10 overs and bat if necessary, but he’s still not right. Andrew Hurley has a simple thought: “I miss Pakistan.” Seriously, though, imagine them today. You’d get two games for the price of one: India v Pakistan, and Pakistan v Pakistan.Pandya strikes! Neesham tried to go over the leg side and mistimed the ball miles in the air towards long on, where Karthik took a comfortable catch. There have been many mistimed strokes in this innings, and every time somebody tries to go up a gear they get out.40th over: New Zealand 155-3 (Taylor 38, Neesham 7) Taylor survives a possible run-our chance, with Kohli’s throw missing the stumps for the second time today. We haven’t seen a replay so I’ve no idea whether he would have been out with a direct hit.Four singles from Bumrah’s over, and here’s more from Butch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e46a06fe5bf4626043de7d50f17373ea96e5207/0_263_5212_3127/master/5212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b63e81b15f91dfe6a20359959dde2985","title":"tour de france 2019 stage four live","story":"Elia Viviani wins the sprint from - I think - Kristoff. 1 km to go: Around one side of a massive roundabout they go, with Jumbo-Visna at the front keeping the pace high for Dylan Groenewegen. 2km to go: The road narrows again, then widens again, then narrows again, the riders getting squeezed accordingly. 4km to go: Team Ineos take over at the front with the riders of Cofidis alongside them. There’s a big roundabout ahoy as they speed along the road, which has widened again. 5km to go: Calmejane still has a lead of a couple of seconds - nope, he’s caught. There’s a fairly sharp right to negotiate and Lotto Soudal are best placed as they swing around it, maintaining a very high pace. 6km to go: The road remains wide and there’s several teams fanned across it as they head towards the pinch point they’ll have to squeeze into with about 1.5km to go. 11km to go: Lilian Calmejane of Team Total Direct Energie attacks off the front of the peloton and puts a few seconds between him and the bunch on a downhill. He opens a gap of about seven seconds on the wide road then takes a sharp left with the bunch in hot pursuit. 11 km to go: Unsurprisingly, Michael Schar has been designated the most aggressive rider of the day. An email: This epic, from Nick. “If Ian’s friends forks failed in the past five years I’m going to guess they were not steel, as most bikes now have aluminium or carbon forks - because they can be made lighter,” he writes. “Ian’s 1990’s Peugeot will probably have steel forks. Although steel forks are heaver, they have as an advantage a very benign failure mode. Under load steel bends a bit and then springs back. If you keep bending it too much it will - eventually - fatigue and crack, but the crack will be gradual and the bike will handle more and more oddly - and chances are you’ll notice it before it finally gives way.“Aluminium and carbon have much more spectacular failure modes in which they both essentially fail spontaneously. I think. So in summary (and I’m neither a lawyer nor a material scientist) a steel fork will probably last as long as you, assuming you don’t do anything daft with it, and even if it starts to fail, it will do so gently.“An aluminium or carbon fork will theoretically last just as long, but if it does fail it will basically just collapse, leading to unpleasantness with which Ian is familiar. Hope your friend is on the mend. I have a 1979 Peugeot in the shed, and if it didn’t have too much rust in the bottom bracket threads for me to get a new one in, I’d ride it without a second thought.”Well, every day’s a school day. My question, Nick, is if you’re neither a lawyer nor a material scientist, what the hell do you do?!?!?!15km to go: The peloton are riding into a headwind and Sunweb rider Nico Roche has a go at one of his team-mates for not doing a long enough turn on the front. 16km to go: Team Sunweb take over at the front of the bunch as Schar is swallowed up and promptly dumped out the back. He’ll win today’s combativity award, you’d imagine. 17km to go: Michael Schar drops Frederick Backaert, who is caught by the bunch. Schar leads the chasing posse by just 12 seconds on the second and final classified climb of the day. Behind him, the members of Team Ineos have massed at the front of the bunch. An email: “I would rely upon metallurgists and engineers to address steel failure or manufacturing malpractice,” writes Dale, in response to my query about Ian Lafford’s mate’s accident (15.57). “All metals can and will fail eventually, but steel is quite elastic and tends to reveal an impending failure well before the event. Since the failure was at the junction of the fork blades and crown, I would guess either (1) previous incident or (2) manufacturing defect. When that is sorted, the lawyer may step in.” 20km to go: Schar and Backaert pass through a designated litter collection zone. A man with a social conscience, Schar empties his jersey pockets of empty wrappers and chucks them to one side. His travelling companion doesn’t bother. An email: “I was just wondering what the riders do with the Yellow Jersey they are given to at the podium,”” writes Keats from New Jersey. “With the yellow jersey’s zipper at the back of the jersey rather than the front, I don’t think the jersey is usable at all.” I’m not sure, Keats. Maybe they use it to wash the car or bike instead of a sponge! However, I would guess, given it’s one of the most iconic garments in all of sport, they probably get around to having it mounted in a frame or presentation case and then proudly display it somewhere. 26km to go: With a flick of his elbow, Schar invites Backaert to do a turn in front and the Belgian reluctantly agrees. 28km to go: Our three man breakaway is now a two-man breakaway. Yoann Olfredo has thrown in the towel ands is about to be caught by the by the bunch following an attack by Schar. Frederik Backaert is still on Schar’s wheel and the latter’s sudden burst of enthusiasm means the gap is now back out to 44 seconds. An email: “Do you ever worry about the safety of your classic 1980s De Rosa?” asks Ian Lafford of Gareth Thomas (15:25). “I’ve been happily riding around on a classic 1990s Peugeot, but have started worrying about metal fatigue having attended the scene of a friend’s crash recently. With no warning, his front fork snapped cleanly off at the bottom of the steerer, planting him face-first into the road and leaving him with pretty horrific injuries. His bike was only five years old, though it may well have done more miles than mine has in 25.” That sounds thoroughly unpleasant. As a matter of curiosity, would anyone who knows more about the legal business than I do happen to know if one can sue the bike manufacturer for trauma, medical expenses, wages lost through time off work and all the rest in the event of an accident like that? 32km to go: Thibaut Pinot punctures and gets a new front wheel in no time at all. A team-mate waits for him up the road and the duo set off in hot pursuit of the peloton. They’ll catch them quickly as the bunch isn’t go0ing particularly fast. 35km to go: The gap is down to 21 seconds. In terms of picking a winner of today’s stage, Dylan Groenewegen is the favourite with the bookies. Elia Viviani is next in the betting, followed by Caleb Ewan, Peter Sagan and Sonny Colbrelli. My money is staying in my pocket, but if I was having a speculative punt I’d put my 50p on Alexander Kristoff at a massive 25-1. You can get Andre Greipel at nearly three times that price. I suppose he’s not getting any younger. 44km to go: The gap drops to 54 seconds with 44 kilometres to go. I need to pull into the side of the road again, before we get to the business end of the race but will be back in a few hot minutes. 51 min: Speaking of pinch points, the road narrows just a couple of feet on either side as the peloton go over a bridge and EF Education First rider Mike Woods hits the deck as the bunch concertinas involuntary. He gets straight back on his back and pedals on. An email: “In response to John Brady in Toronto, it’s just a matter of learning to like the pain!” writes Gareth Thomas. “I used to ride regularly from Canterbury to Lake Garda - over the Alps - every summer. 700 miles in six days 20 hours (at the fastest). “Now at 67, my idea of enjoyment is climbing the local Aitana mountain ridge in the Costa Blanca on a classic 1980s De Rosa and it hurts all the way. Some cyclists enjoy the uphill pain so much they don’t even bother with the downhill freewheel, but get their girlfriend to pick them up in the car at the summit.” Crikey! I really need to get my bike out of the spare room and on to the road. Today’s finish: The road narrows into a pinch-point with about two kilometres to go, then widens again. It’s on a fast downhill, so there’s a big chance of a crash as assorted teams refuse to give way when the road gets more narrow, so desperate will they be to ensure their sprinters - men like Caleb Ewan, Dylan Groenewegen and Elia Viviani – are in the right place at the right time. Obviously they have to catch the breakaway group first, but it’s only a matter of time before that happens. The gap is currently 1min 27sec. 63km to go: “Speaking of Tony Martin, why didn’t he let Thomas De Gendt go in the break yesterday?” asks David. “Tactics, bad blood between teams, or something else? I always like to see Thomas on the front for hours.”That is a question I do not have the answer to, because I was unaware Tony Martin wielded such influence in the peloton and had no idea he prevented the Lotto Soudal man from doing anything. Can anyone else shed any light on the matter? 65km to go: Elia Viviani is best of the rest, followed by Sonny Colbrelli and Peter Sagan. Intermediate sprint: Frederik Backaert is first over the line, followed by Michael Schär. Yoann Offredo is third. Back in the bunch, the main sprinters are preparing to hoover up the rest of the points on offer. 71km to go: The subject of discussion on Eurosport at the moment is the possible transfer of Tom Dumoulin from Team Sunweb to Team Jumbo-Visma for next year. Dumoulin is not at the Tour this year, having failed to recover from a knee injury in time and is rumoured to have fallen out with his team hierarchy over the way his treatment was managed.“The last month has been extremely difficult overall and with the setbacks in the knee recovery,” Dumoulin said last month. “After what happened at the Giro I really wanted to go for it in the Tour, but this week I realised it’s not realistic for my level to be there in time. I’ve tried so hard to get there but I really have to listen to my body and release myself from chasing an unrealistic goal.”79km to go: The riders of Team Ineos, the cyclists formerly known as Team Sky, are lined up near the front of the bunch, about five or six men back. With the wind blowing quite strongly, the main GC contenders are all near the front of the bunch after nearly three-and-a-half hours of racing. 82km to go: Michael Schär (CCC), Yoann Offredo (Wanty–Groupe Gobert) and Frederik Backaert (Wanty–Groupe Gobert) are the men who have been in front since the gun and they lead the peloton by 2min 39sec. The director of the TV coverage is now so bored that he is reduced to setting up shots that might earn him a job in arthouse cinema. The latest is a shot of the reflection of the peloton rolling past in the sunglasses of a somebody standing on the side of the road. I suppose the simple answer, John, is that they do lots of training. In a fit of unbridled enthusiasm, I bought a bike from the good folk at Brixton Cycles, upon my return from covering the first half of the 2015 Tour. Despite my best intentions, I reckon I’ve done less than 75 kilometres in total in combined rides on it in the past four years.  Exciting news: Tim Wellens, who won yesterday’s combativity award and is currently wearing the polka dot jersey, has dropped out of the peloton ... and gone back to his team car to pick up some liquid refreshment for himself and his team-mates. It’s all happening today!!! 93km to go: The leading riders hit an incline and are forced out of the saddle for the first time today as they tackle one of just two classified climbs today. Michael Schar takes the solitary King of the Mountains point on offer. The gap to the bunch is 3min 25sec. 95km to go: Back out in the countryside, the three lads in front cycle past a four spectators on the roadside, three of whom are sitting in a large rubber dinghy that is full of water. They are joined by the fourth, who attracts the attention of a passing cameraman and jumps in creating a big splash. And to think some people disapprove of lunchtime drinking. 100km to go: The gap from the breakaway to the bunch is 3min 12sec and we’re past the halfway point. The three men in front are currently being cheered through the town of Bar-le-Duc, where thousands of spectators have lined the streets. An email: “Had life taken you down a (slightly) different path, what kind of cyclist would you have liked to have been?” asks Craig. “I can see you as a Cavendish-style scrappy sprinter.” I don’t think so, Craig. While the idea of being a big name superstar cyclist appeals, I am very much one of life’s domestiques. Global Cycling Network: Here, for anyone who’s interested, is what goes into those musettes the cyclists grab from their soigneurs and swing over their shoulders.114km to go: The gap from the breakaway to to the bunch is 3min 26sec as the peloton rolls through Revigny-sur-Ornain. The feed zone is on the outskirts of the town and as the three riders in front pass through it, Michael Schär accidentally comes between Frederik Backaert and the soigneur holding out his musette for collection. Backaert leaves empty-handed, but will be sorted out quickly enough by somebody in the team car.

Can there really be a right – or wrong – way to enjoy your favourite malt?It can often seem as if there are only two schools of thought when it comes to how you should enjoy your whisky. Some treat the drink with an almost austere reverence, insisting that it should only be taken neat or with just a touch of water – maybe, at a pinch, with an ice cube or two. Others, which in reality means most people who enjoy a tipple every now and then, are happy to mix it to taste with whatever works for them, use it as a base for a cocktail, or simply sip it from a mighty tumbler towering with ice.But is there a right way to drink whisky? It might be that you can do whatever you want with the house blend down at your local pub, but what about something more refined – in other words, what about a single malt?For the uninitiated, the distinction between a blend and a single malt is a fairly easy one to mark out. A scotch blend is simply a mixture of grain and malt whiskies from two or more distilleries. A single malt, on the other hand, is nothing more and nothing less than a whisky from a single distillery, bottled and sold as a whisky from a single distillery.But, of course, things are always a little more complicated than that. Blends are sometimes thought to be inferior to their single malt cousins, and while this is by no means a settled question, it is true that they don’t quite inspire the same scholarly devotion as single malts. So, while plenty of whisky purists may have no problem with you topping up an inexpensive blend with a yard of Coke, they’re likely to take a less charitable view of you doing the same with their favourite malt.Luckily, there is an answer to all of this.“It really just depends on what you’re looking for,” says Kirstie McCallum, senior blender at Distell International, which owns and produces Tobermory. “For me there’s a real difference between wanting to sit there and appreciate a whisky for all its flavours and complexity, and just actually wanting to sit there and enjoy a drink with friends.“If I want to appreciate all the flavours in a whisky and appreciate that maturation and the work that’s gone into it I love it with just a wee touch of water to open it up,” she says. “Then just sip it, let it rest in your mouth a bit so that you get a proper chance to take in all of the flavours. At the same time, if you’re just sitting around having a drink with your friends, do whatever you want with it.”McCallum’s refreshingly unpretentious take is rooted in her view that whisky – and that includes single malts – is on the whole a social, relaxed drink. That means there is plenty of room at the table both for those who want to contemplate their whisky – either neat or, as she prefers it, with a touch of water – and those who want to let their hair down a bit more.“I think for too long whisky has been seen as kind of standoffish,” she says. “There’s always been this view of whisky that it’s maybe a bit like how people see wine – they worry about not knowing what to ask for or about getting it wrong somehow. But whisky shouldn’t be like that at all, because it’s a drink for everybody.“We make the whisky for people to drink it, and whatever you like adding to it, as long as you enjoy it that’s how you should drink it,” says McCallum. “The great thing is that whisky is just such a versatile drink. You can do cocktails with whisky, you can do long drinks, or you can have a nice single malt with water.”With that in mind, McCallum suggests a number of tantalising options for enjoying Tobermory 12 Year Old. “I think with Tobermory being such a citrusy, caramelly, kind of sweet whisky, it mixes well with something that’s nice and light and fresh,” she says.“It works really well as a long mixed drink with lots of ice. I’d recommend trying it that way with either ginger ale or some fresh apple juice,” she says.On the cocktail front, McCallum says that the citrus and caramel notes of Tobermory 12 Year Old are particularly complemented by berry flavours – so a Scotch bramble, or perhaps a malt old fashioned with a blueberry garnish, could be well worth trying.“For me, whisky is a very personal drink,” she says. “I drink my whisky and it’s about memories of being places and being with friends – it’s not about ‘you can’t do this and you can’t do that’. In the end, it’s about enjoying it on your own terms – do whatever you want with it.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25088c4cea6df5dc18a576f6fe22cd68627feae/219_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d477bb8b30e3a59a22a8fac97be84e7b","title":"david attenborough young people give me hope on environment","story":"Naturalist tells MPs radical action needed to tackle crisis but attitude of young people gives him hopeThe attitude of young people towards tackling the environmental crisis is “a source of great hope”, David Attenborough has told MPs, as he predicted that polluting the planet would soon provoke as much abhorrence as slavery.Giving evidence to the business, energy and industrial strategy committee on how to tackle the climate emergency, the naturalist and TV presenter said radical action was required.Asked by the Tory MP Patrick McLoughlin, a committee member, whether the government’s new commitment of net zero carbon emissions for the UK by 2050 was rapid enough, Attenborough said such targets were not necessarily the best approach.“In a way I would think that is not the way of focusing on the problem,” he said. “We cannot be radical enough in dealing with the issues that face us at the moment. The question is: what is practically possible? How can we take the electorate with us in dealing with these things?”He said: “The most encouraging thing that I see, of course, is that the electors of tomorrow are already making themselves and their voices very, very clear. And that is a source of great comfort in a way, but also the justification, the reality, that these young people are recognising that their world is the future.“I’m OK, and all of us here are OK, because we don’t face the problems that are coming. But the problems in the next 30 years are really major problems that are going to cause social unrest, and great changes in the way that we live, and what we eat. It’s going to happen.”Asked by the Labour MP Vernon Coaker to expand on how public attitudes were shifting, Attenborough replied: “There was a time in the 19th century when it was perfectly acceptable for civilised human beings to think that it was morally acceptable to actually own another human being for a slave. And somehow or other, in the space of 20 or 30 years, the public perception of that totally transformed.”He said: “I suspect that we are right now in the beginning of a big change. Young people in particular are the stimulus that’s bringing it about.“People are understanding that to chuck plastic into the ocean is an insult. To have the nerve to say: ‘This is our rubbish. We’ll give you money and you can spread it on your land instead of ours, in the far east,’ is intolerable. And for some reason or other young people understand that. And that’s a source of great hope to me.”Asked for his most vivid impressions of the impact of humans on the planet, Attenborough recalled returning to the Great Barrier Reef off Australia, where he had first ed in the 1950s.“I will never forget ing on the reef about 10 years ago and suddenly seeing that instead of this multitude of wonderful forms and life, that it was stark white, it had bleached white because of the rising temperatures and the increasing acidity of the sea,” he said. “If you wipe that out you wipe out whole areas of the ocean.”Another example was returning to a glacier in South Georgia after 10 years and finding it was not even visible.Attenborough stressed that the important point was the overall picture: “Sceptics will say: ‘I can take you to another place where glaciers grew,’ or something, or ‘I can take you to a place where the coral reefs are flourishing.’ So it’s difficult to pick one point and one site where you can actually say it’s proof. It isn’t. It’s just an example.”Asked about the impact of his Blue Planet II series on awareness about plastic in oceans, Attenborough said he had spent 20 years trying to raise awareness of the issue.“I’d been putting it in programmes for years, but nobody took much notice of it,” he said. “And in Blue Planet II it was a sequence that lasted two minutes maximum, I should say, and yet for some reason – if I knew what the reason was I’d be a richer man, I dare say – it rang a bell in the public consciousness. I’ve never seen anything like it.”Attenborough said he nonetheless never set out to be a campaigner: “I’m not by nature a propagandist. I started making natural history programmes because I thought there was nothing I would prefer to see more than the beauty of the natural world. And I would love to just go on doing that. That’s what I enjoy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1f995497f824baa71f47180472dd9f0246bd0e8/0_211_2548_1529/master/2548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9f37334355beddba02176377dff68c8","title":"alexander acosta jeffrey epstein plea deal resignation","story":"Fresh calls for Alex Acosta to resign for cutting ‘sweetheart deal’ in 2008 that shielded Epstein from federal sexual abuse chargesAlex Acosta, the US labor secretary, is facing renewed calls for his resignation over the lenient 2008 plea deal he cut with Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier who on Monday was charged with operating a sex trafficking ring involving girls as young as 14.Acosta has come under a blizzard of calls from senior Democrats to step down or face fresh congressional scrutiny over the unusual deal he struck with Epstein when he was Miami’s top federal prosecutor 11 years ago. Epstein, 66, pleaded not guilty on Monday in a New York court to one count of sex trafficking conspiracy and a second of sex trafficking underage females.The unsealed indictment accused Epstein of operating a “network enabling him to sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls”. Epstein was alleged to have employed previous victims to recruit new targets of his crimes.“I am calling on Secretary Acosta to resign,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, said in a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday. “It is now impossible for anyone to have confidence in Secretary Acosta’s ability to lead the Department of Labor.” “If he refuses to resign, President Trump should fire him,” Schumer added.Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, said Donald Trump had known Acosta’s role in the deal when he nominated him as labor secretary.She tweeted: “Secretary Acosta must step down. As US attorney, he engaged in an unconscionable agreement w Jeffrey Epstein kept secret from courageous, young victims preventing them from seeking justice. This was known by Potus when he appointed him to the cabinet.”The Florida congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is one of the lawmakers leading the push for Acosta to quit. In an interview with the  she renewed her call for his resignation, accusing him of having allowed Epstein to evade all accountability for his sex crimes.Wasserman Schultz, who earlier this year joined fellow Democratic lawmakers in pressing for an official government investigation into Acosta’s role in the handling of the Epstein case, pointed out that, as labor secretary, Acosta is responsible for child labor laws and human trafficking.She said: “A big part of his job is protecting workers and children from exploitation, yet he has demonstrated that he has utter disregard for victims and instead his priority is to protect sexual predators.”The congresswoman told the  that if Acosta survived the current storm, pressure was already building within the congressional oversight committee to call Acosta in for questioning. She said: “There is strong interest among my colleagues to pursue this, it is absolutely time for us to take the next steps on holding Acosta accountable.”Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator who was Hillary Clinton’s running mate in the 2016 presidential election, said bluntly on Twitter: “Acosta must go. He handed a sweetheart deal to a serial sexual predator.”Kaine grilled the then federal prosecutor during his Senate confirmation hearing in March 2017. After Acosta was confirmed by 52 Republicans and eight Democrats, Kaine said one of the main reasons he voted against confirmation was the nominee’s record on the Epstein case.As the federal prosecutor leading the case in 2008, Acosta oversaw a plea deal in which Epstein was granted a highly unusual non-prosecution agreement that shielded him from all federal criminal charges relating to his more than 30 incidents of potential abuse of young girls. Under the deal, the FBI investigation that had already culminated in a 53-page draft indictment was shut down in favor of Epstein pleading guilty to two lesser state charges that controversially labelled his victims as prostitutes.Immunity was also granted to Epstein’s “potential co-conspirators”, though it did not identify iniduals. Epstein ended up serving just 13 months in jail with the ability to leave the prison every day to attend his luxury business premises.How Acosta, 50, emerges from the furor is likely to depend heavily on the view taken by Trump and his inner circle of aides. A former White House adviser told Politico that “the next 72 hours are critical”.In February, Trump lauded his cabinet minister as a “fantastic labor secretary”. But so far the president has been ominously silent since Epstein was arrested on Saturday.Trump’s position is complicated by the fact that he is reportedly among a number of Epstein’s rich and powerful friends. Others are said to include Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton.A spokesperson for Clinton said on Monday said: “President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.”The renewed focus on Epstein, and in turn on Acosta, was triggered in part by an in-depth investigation by the Miami Herald last November. The newspaper identified 80 women sexually abused or molested by the billionaire over the five years to 2006.Most of Epstein’s survivors are now in their late 20s and 30s. One of the most contentious aspects of the bargain struck by Acosta was that it was conducted in secret: none of the women were informed of the deal and allowed to express their opinion about it.Under federal law, such plea deals have to be presented to victims in advance to ensure that they have input. In a withering ruling in February, a federal judge, Kenneth Marra, found that federal prosecutors led by Acosta had broken the law by hiding the agreement.Marra concluded that a federal prosecution should have been conducted. “Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others,’’ the judge wrote.None of the women abused by Epstein have commented on Acosta’s position in Trump’s cabinet in the wake of Monday’s indictments. But the statements of two women were read out on the steps of the courthouse by their attorney, Sigrid McCawley of Boies Schiller Flexner, in which they clearly implied that justice had not been served in 2008.“It is time for Jeffrey Epstein and those who participated and enabled his sex crimes to be brought to true justice,” said Virginia Giuffre. Fellow survivor Sarah Ransome said: “The news of my abuser’s arrest today is a step in the right direction to finally hold Epstein accountable for his crimes – it restores my faith that money and power cannot triumph over justice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03718a88ba7d71186b6d19c7b34ee7a7e402b3e8/51_0_1533_920/master/1533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76c53c671f6edceb2c8df9ca8b5e936","title":"glacial melting in antarctica may become irreversible","story":"Thwaites glacier is likely to thaw and trigger 50cm sea level rise, US study suggestsAntarctica faces a tipping point where glacial melting will accelerate and become irreversible even if global heating eases, research suggests.A Nasa-funded study found instability in the Thwaites glacier meant there would probably come a point when it was impossible to stop it flowing into the sea and triggering a 50cm sea level rise. Other Antarctic glaciers were likely to be similarly unstable.Recent research found the rate of ice loss from five Antarctic glaciers had doubled in six years and was five times faster than in the 1990s. Ice loss is spreading from the coast into the continent’s interior, with a reduction of more than 100 metres in thickness at some sites.The Thwaites glacier, part of the West Antarctic ice sheet, is believed to pose the greatest risk for rapid future sea level rise. Research recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal found it was likely to succumb to instability linked to the retreat of its grounding line on the seabed that would lead to it shedding ice faster than previously expected.Alex Robel, an assistant professor at the US Georgia Institute of Technology and the study’s leader, said if instability was triggered, the ice sheet could be lost in the space of 150 years, even if temperatures stopped rising. “It will keep going by itself and that’s the worry,” he said.Modelling simulations suggested extensive ice loss would start in 600 years but the researchers said it could occur sooner depending on the pace of global heating and nature of the instability.Hélène Seroussi, a jet propulsion laboratory scientist at Nasa, said: “It could happen in the next 200 to 600 years. It depends on the bedrock topography under the ice, and we don’t know it in great detail yet.”Antarctica has nearly eight times more land-based ice than Greenland and 50 times more than all mountain glaciers combined. The Thwaites glacier alone contains enough ice to increase global sea levels by about 50cm. Sea level rise linked to warming has already been linked with increased coastal flooding and storm surges.The researchers found a precise estimate of how much ice the glacier would shed in the next 50 to 800 years was not possible due to unpredictable climate fluctuations and data limitations. However, 500 simulations of different scenarios pointed to it losing stability. This increased uncertainty about future sea level rise but made the worst-case scenarios more likely.A complete loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet would be expected to increase global sea levels by about five metres (16ft), causing coastal cities around the world to become submerged.A separate study last week in the same journal found the expanse of sea ice around Antarctica had suffered a “precipitous” fall since 2014. Satellite data showed Antarctica lost as much sea ice in four years as the Arctic lost in 34 years.Unlike the melting of ice sheets on land, sea ice melting does not raise sea levels but the loss of the reflective white ice leads to more of the sun’s heat being absorbed in the ocean, increasing the pace of heating.Antarctic sea ice had been gradually increasing during 40 years of measurement and reached a record maximum in 2014, before falling markedly. The cause of the abrupt turnaround has not been established."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67b532c5fc2cea7e6792f15c60e8c0d77f18ebd/0_65_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1473c08b65a728a0dac3ff0532bbd2e","title":"nicaragua costa rica daniel ortega exiles","story":"Costa Rica has become a precarious refuge for thousands of Nicaraguan exiles. In the streets of San José, they continue to feel President Ortega’s reachThis project was produced by Dawning, an organization devoted to investigative journalism. It is an independent effort, self-funded, non-partisan and non-ideological, in the tradition of journalism in the public interest.Forty years ago, Daniel Ortega and his wife Rosario Murillo hid together in safe houses around Costa Rica’s capital while waiting for the imminent fall of the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza. Today, thousands of their exiled compatriots hide in the same city, San José, awaiting the fall of the presidential couple.Nicaraguan exiles come from every walk of life. All of them have one thing in common: if they returned home, they say they would be arrested, tortured, or killed. They are some of Ortega’s most wanted.Victor Barrantes, Costa Rica’s vice-minister of government and police, says “the government has no concrete evidence that would suggest that Nicaraguan paramilitary or counter-intelligence groups are operating in our country. However, we are investigating, as we do receive complaints.” In this project, based on over 50 interviews over a four-month period in San José and Managua, we hear their voices and see their faces, as they recount their wounds and hopes in the midst of great uncertainty.When the protests began in April 2018, Dr Estrada left his job to serve as a medic in a makeshift clinic in his native Monimbo, an emblematic locale since the Sandinista revolution. “We used restaurant tables, a tent, and some stretchers. In 88 days, we treated about 2,000 people. We hardly slept. But it felt good to serve my town.” On 17 July, 2018, government forces regained control of Monimbo, and Dr Estrada walked for six days towards the Costa Rican border. “I received money to maintain the barricades, and now the government is accusing me of funding terrorism.”Unable to find a job in San José, Dr Estrada lives off donations. “It’s a slow but sure death if I continue here. I don’t want to die in exile without seeing my family again. Ortega is destroying us.”“Vice-president Murillo issued an order offering us $5,000 per kill during the protests. But I refused to participate in that massacre.” The 35-year old officer spoke on condition of anonymity. After refusing orders, he was captured and taken to El Chipote prison in April 2018. “Everyone was naked and crying.” Over 16 days he was raped and mutilated and, suffered electroshocks to his genitals. Three toenails were removed, his jaw dislocated, and two teeth yanked out. “They took me and four others, threw us into Tiscapa lagoon and shot at us. I don’t know where I got the strength from, but I started running.”He was found by students. After recovering in Jinotega, he and his wife crossed the border. He is undergoing psychological treatment.“San José is infested with Nicaraguan intelligence. I don’t want to live in fear, but I can’t sleep at night.”Ericka was the leader of a barricade in her native Masaya. She was captured and taken to El Chipote. “They forced me to take photos in front of a lot of weapons, saying I was a terrorist. They hit me when I protested. They undressed and blindfolded me. I was raped by five policemen. Then they threw me into a pitch-black cell. They forced me to read a false statement on camera incriminating 15 of my neighbors.”A day later, human rights defenders helped release some prisoners, including Ericka. She returned to her barricade, where she provided food and weapons, until Masaya was taken by government forces. “My group was the last. We resisted until midday. While running to hide, I was shot in my buttocks. We killed the person who did it.”Two days later, she crossed the border and was transported to San José in an ambulance. “I live in fear. The paramilitary are here looking for me.”Raul Oporta was an active community leader in Boaco. He founded a new political party called Citizens for Freedom soon before the protests, during which he established himself as a logistical leader. Raul was arrested while sitting on his front porch. He was charged with damages against state property – which he denies – and was put on trial.“The witnesses appointed by the prosecutors and police did not want to show up in court to incriminate me because they knew it was all false”.In December 2018, only one witness testified, a neighbor. “I am convinced he was coerced to lie. With just one witness, I was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. During recess, I fled.” Disguised as a priest, he escaped to Costa Rica on motorcycle. In San José, Raul participates in political meetings of exiles to organize and discuss the future of Nicaragua.Oporta’s restaurant business in Nicaragua, currently managed by his wife, was recently denied the renovation of its alcohol license. The official letter from the Nicaraguan police states that they “will not authorize business permits for people who participated and were investigated for their actions in the failed coup”, and affirms that Raul “wants to use his business as a meeting point with the only goal of continuing his terrorist acts”.The most renowned journalist in Nicaragua, Chamorro went into exile in Costa Rica in January after police raided the offices at Confidencial, of which he is founder and editor. “We filed a lawsuit against the government for robbing us during our broadcasts of the protests. Shortly after, I appeared as one of the first names on a notice of capture. But I’ve been persecuted these last 10 years. There is massive repression of news channels in Nicaragua.”In San José, Chamorro continues working on stories, now broadcast via YouTube. “I am optimistic about the crisis resolving itself through political means. But a quick exit isn’t just going to fall from the sky. We need the international community to reach a negotiation with or without Ortega.”Leticia, one of the most visible faces in the channel, covered the protests since April and, on multiple occasions, was assaulted and had equipment confiscated or broken.While traveling to cover protests in Ticuantepe in June, her station van was intercepted. “They ransacked our vehicle and stole everything. The entire time they held an AK-47 to my head and whispered lewd sexual comments in my ear.”“Ortega has tried to silence us, but we continue reporting from here.”In January 2019, the government asked Canal 12 to stop broadcasting all programs by Carlos Chamorro. That same month, over 30 police officers entered the studio and asked journalists to present their identification.Rafael Solis was considered one of Ortega’s closest allies for decades, but his public renunciation letter described Nicaragua as a “dictatorship”. Solis championed the controversial legal modifications to allow Ortega to run for re- election in 2011.“I made a mistake”, says Solis. “Nicaragua needs a profound judicial reform, or even a new constitution. And we need a truth commission to investigate everything that happened since April 2018.”Solis is hopeful about the opportunities for dialogue. “Violence will not solve this crisis. We need dialogue. But Ortega has to free all political prisoners. We need to be patient.”This is the first time Solis has been photographed in a public space in Costa Rica. “I take precautions here, but I am not afraid. I risked my life against Somoza’s dictatorship. I have faith.”“Many farmers have been killed in the past six years. What happened in April 2018 is not new to us – Ortega’s regime has consistently tried to silence us. He has sold our land to the Chinese.”Nemesio was responsible for the national coordination of the farmers’ barricades.“We faced a lot of crises because we had different views on how to approach the protests. We don’t agree with violence.” In July, with his town under heavy attack, Nemesio fled.“We lost many people that day. I don’t know if they’re alive, dead, or in jail.” Nemesio’s wife and children joined him in Costa Rica, but he only sees them twice a month.“This is not a safe exile for me. I know they’re trying to kill me. In a way, we are interrupting Costa Rica’s democracy, because Nicaragua is sending paramilitaries after us. Part of the Nicaraguan conflict is now here.”In July, she was three weeks pregnant when police attacked the campus of Unan, where she served as logistics manager for all 89 days of protests. “We cooked, showered and slept on campus. At night we played cards and sang songs.” For two months, María hid in three secret safe houses until her capture in late September. She was taken to El Chipote, dressed in blue prison clothes, and presented to the press by the police.“It was a total charade. I suddenly was all over the media as a dangerous delinquent.” In prison, María slept on the floor and was beaten regularly. She was denied medical attention until an ultrasound revealed her child had died. “My child was dead inside me for a week.”She was released but continued being harassed by government forces. Soon after, María arrived in Costa Rica with her mother, exactly three weeks after her 20th birthday.During the first week of protests in April, Jonas, who studied civil engineering, witnessed the deaths of 14 fellow students. “I suddenly saw myself in the middle of a war. I had never seen someone die before. I wasn’t ready.”In early May, he joined the barricades at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN), where he stayed for 77 days. “It was beautiful to see the whole city unite and support one another.” Jonas was arrested and taken to El Chipote prison. “They threw me into a cell. I was tortured every day by four masked policemen. They used electric shocks and a baseball bat. I never received food or water. I lost consciousness several times during the interrogations. On the fifth day, I pretended to faint because I knew my torturers would kill me. Luckily, they sent me to a hospital. I had four fractured ribs.”Jonas escaped the hospital and took refuge in a safe house until he crossed the border, still wearing a bandage around his ribs. “I am free here, but it’s very hard to survive in Costa Rica.”“I have been documenting the human rights violations committed by my government since the 1990s. During the first week of protests, I submitted an official report to the public ministry of Nicaragua, pointing to specific officials responsible for the deaths of 42 young people. We also know the government purposefully obscured its public morgue records during the protests.”Two months later, Leiva received a call from a friend informing him the government had filed papers declaring him a terrorist and ordering his capture.“He told me: ‘Álvaro, you need to run’.” He fled to Costa Rica with his team of human rights defenders. “I picked up dead bodies from both sides. I don’t defend parties, I defend humans. But it’s hard to remain impartial. We won’t have peace without justice.”“The police entered our office at night and stole everything we had. After that, many of our colleagues left the country horrified. But I decided to stay in Managua.”Vilma says that Cenidh is rebuilding. “Terror has not stopped. People are still imprisoned, tortured and disappeared here. Our prisons are torture centers. Our fear is not pathological: it’s real fear. The government is crushing our ability to fight. Meanwhile, our exiles in Costa Rica are facing a humanitarian crisis.”“I am not free yet. Nicaraguan exiles live like prisoners in Costa Rica. We’re trapped in a system of constant persecution. I fear for my life on the street. My mother called me three months ago to threaten me again after years of silence. If I return to Nicaragua, I am sure I would disappear.”After six years in Costa Rica, the government has not yet granted her refugee status. The embassy of Nicaragua refuses to renew her passport. “I am changing homes constantly for my own safety. But without refugee status I cannot travel outside of the country.”Zoilamérica also opened up about her father. “Ortega is dominated by fear. Losing power would mean death for him. That’s why he’s so dangerous. To be judged for his crimes would be his biggest nightmare.”Photographs, interviews, and transcripts by Jorge Cabrera, Juan Carlos Ulate, Ana Acosta, Mees van der Werf, Diego Rivera, Alberto Molina, M Sawyer Ballance, Rafe H Andrews and Raul Roman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0e88e0f5a442635338ad4c11ae4473005e69ad0/0_98_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0eb8ff0432eb985efdd6bb5f97078f1","title":"saudi princess hassa bint salman tried in absentia in france","story":"Princess Hassa accused of getting bodyguard to beat man for taking photo in Paris homeThe sister of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia is going on trial in absentia in Paris accused of conspiring to kidnap and beat a worker who was refurbishing her luxury apartment in Paris.Hassa bint Salman’s French lawyer said she denied the charges of complicity in armed violence, complicity in holding someone against their will and theft against an Egyptian-born man who was carrying out repairs at her family’s Paris residence on the exclusive Avenue Foch in September 2016.France issued an international arrest warrant for the princess in November 2017, and the hearing was expected to go ahead in her absence.Hassa is the sister of Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the Saudi throne. She is often celebrated in the Saudi state-run media for her charity work and campaigning for women’s rights.The 43-year-old is accused of conspiring to get her bodyguard to beat the worker, Ashraf Eid, whom she allegedly suspected of taking a photograph of the room he was decorating. She allegedly accused him of planning to sell the photo.According to the indictment, seen by Reuters, Eid told police Hassa’s bodyguard bound his hands and punched and kicked him after she accused him of filming her on his phone.Eid told police that as he was being beaten, the princess said to him: “You’ll see how you speak to a princess, how you speak to the royal family.”In an account given to Le Point news magazine in France, the worker claimed that the princess shouted: “Kill him, the dog, he doesn’t deserve to live.”The princess’s lawyer, Emmanuel Moyne, said the existence of the international arrest warrant against her ruled out her attendance at Tuesday’s hearing, and an offer to enable investigators to question her by video conference had been refused.Moyne told Reuters the investigation was based on falsehoods and said she had never made the alleged remarks about the worker. “The princess is a caring, humble, approachable and cultured woman,” Moyne said. “Saudi law, and ensuring the princess’s security, prohibits taking any image of the princess.”The bodyguard was placed under formal investigation on suspicion of armed violence, theft and holding someone against their will and was denied bail in October 2016.His lawyer told Agence France-Presse: “We hope that the judges will take into account the numerous contradictions and incoherences of the plaintiff. The medical records contradict the version of events of the plaintiff and show that he lied.”The bodyguard has lodged a separate case for defamation against the worker. The Saudi government communications office has not commented on the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99876100e31e1b9ae5d8f4759f2ea6f23df5075e/0_50_1184_710/master/1184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c09f9f4fb7cd04ffec52f2d03254a1","title":"two planes collide on runway at amsterdam airport causing delays easyjet klm","story":"EasyJet service to London and KLM flight to Madrid collided while reversing from gatesTwo planes have collided at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport, causing hours of delay for hundreds of passengers.An easyJet Airbus A320 bound for London and a KLM Boeing 737-800 heading to Madrid were both reversing away from their gates – a process called pushback – when they collided on Tuesday morning.Photographs taken by travellers on both planes showed that the easyJet aircraft’s wing appeared to become lodged on the stabilisers at the tail end of the other plane.A passenger onboard the easyJet flight told the Press Association he had experienced “a bit of a jolt” after the collision but thought it was “nothing unusual”. Travellers on the plane had to wait for more than an hour on the tarmac while ground staff worked out how to deal with the incident, he said.They then faced a further delay of about four hours, but he added: “I’m just happy everyone is OK.”Passengers on the KLM service to Madrid were more swiftly put on a replacement plane. Both aircraft involved in the collision have been withdrawn from service for inspection.“EasyJet can confirm that two aircraft made contact during pushback from stand, one of which was easyJet flight EJU8868 from Amsterdam to London Gatwick,” the company said in a statement.“Passengers have now disembarked into the terminal where they have been provided with updates and refreshment vouchers. The flight is now due to be operated by a replacement aircraft.“The safety of its passengers and crew is easyJet’s highest priority and an investigation has been launched in line with procedure to understand what happened.”KLM, the Dutch national carrier, tweeted: “This morning a KLM Boeing 737-800 hit another aircraft during the pushback at the gate.

It was the first official UAE confirmation of a withdrawal, which has been reported in recent weeks by witnesses and foreign officials.Yemen\u0026nbsphas been troubled by civil wars for decades, but the current conflict intensified in March 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened on behalf of the internationally recognised government against Houthi rebels aligned with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.The war is widely regarded as having turned a poor country into a humanitarian catastrophe. Riyadh expected its air power, backed by regional coalition including the United Arab Emirates, could defeat the Houthi insurgency in a matter of months.Its roots lie in the Arab spring. Pro-democracy protesters took to the streets in a bid to force the president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to end his 33-year rule. He responded with economic concessions but refused to resign.By March 2011, tensions on the streets of the capital city, Sana’a, resulted in protesters dying at the hands of the military.Following an internationally brokered deal, there was a transfer of power in November to the vice-president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, paving the way for elections in February 2012 – in which he was the only candidate to lead a transitional government. Hadi’s attempts at constitutional and budget reforms were rejected by Houthi rebels from the north.The Houthis belong to a small branch of Shia Muslims known as Zaydis. They captured the capital, forcing Hadi to flee eventually to Riyadh.The UN brokered an agreement in Stockholm in December 2018 to demilitarise the Red Sea city of Hodeidah, and after five months of tortuous talks a small part of the agreement has been implemented on the ground. The Houthis had promised a two-phase redeployment out of the city, and agreed that an alternative force – poorly defined in the Stockholm agreement – would take over security in the areas they vacated. But talks between the Houthis and the UAE-backed government forces stalled over the details.Faced by an impasse, the UN sanctioned a unilateral Houthi withdrawal from the three main ports on Yemen’s Red Sea coast – Hodeidah, Ras Issa and Saleef. The Yemeni government described the withdrawal as a sham, saying the Houthis had merely rebadged their fighters as coastguards. They pressed for the resignation of Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy for Yemen. Not everyone in the Yemen government agreed with this analysis and the foreign minister quit.No progress has been made on the second phase of redeployment, or the exchange of political prisoners. Griffiths is now trying to secure enough progress in Hodeidah to get off this hook and say the time is ripe for wider political talks on a transitional government to be held in Bonn.The officials said the UAE would remain in the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in 2015 to try to restore the Yemeni government ousted from power by the Houthis, a rebel group backed by Iran.Oversight would be passed to Emirati-trained local Yemeni forces and foreign mercenaries, and UAE forces remaining in Yemen would focus on counter-terrorism efforts against al-Qaida and Islamic State rather than the battle against the Houthis. The UAE would also continue to support a secessionist movement in southern Yemen.Analysts have warned it is not yet clear whether local troops and Saudi coalition partners are up to the task of filling the vacuum, sparking fears that the current stalemate in much of the country could be upended.The UAE drawdown also weakens Saudi Arabia’s military capabilities in Yemen, adding to pressure for Riyadh to proactively pursue a political rather than military solution to the war.The withdrawal had been extensively discussed with Riyadh as well as the UN-recognised Yemen government based in Aden, the officials added.The UAE may be braced for accusations that the withdrawal is an admission of defeat, but the officials insisted the redeployment was a considered move reflecting the diplomatic progress being made by the UN in the strategically important Hodeidah.Hodeidah became a major focus of the war last year when the western-backed Saudi-led coalition tried to seize the port, which is the Houthis’ main supply line.In December the UN brokered a complex ceasefire in the city in which both the Yemeni government and Houthi forces were supposed to withdraw, leaving a new security force to take over the port and the city.Only parts of that withdrawal agreement have been implemented. The UAE said it was keen to see the peace process expanded towards a wider peace settlement with deadlines covering the whole country.The officials denied that the move would create a dangerous vacuum around Hodeidah, arguing that there were as many as 19,000 Yemeni troops in the port city area if progress towards a settlement collapsed.In 2018, by contrast, the UAE had argued that the military capture of Hodeidah would force the Houthis to the negotiating table.The international community pressed the UAE and the Saudis to wait outside the city, warning that an assault could lead to a bloodbath and disruption at the port could tip the country into full-blown famine.Emirati officials have also dismissed suggestions that the drawdown reflects a growing rift between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh: their military and political leaders have long differed on preferred strategy in both the bloody impasse in Yemen and dealing with the threat posed to Gulf interests from Tehran.UAE officials refused to go into details of precise troop movements and said some of the withdrawals were tactical, and so could be reversed. Witnesses have said a large-scale drawdown of troops and heavy weaponry is under way in Marib province and the interim capital of Aden as well as Hodeidah.Last week, Reuters reported it had been told by three diplomats that Abu Dhabi preferred to have its forces and equipment on hand should tension between the US and Iran escalate further after attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf and Tehran’s suspected downing of a US drone. Those tanker attacks have been ascribed to Iranian surrogates, but no final attribution has been made by the UAE. On Monday the UAE officials said the timing was not linked to those developments."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3950677.1562618137!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet to be told about dire realities of no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney:  Mr Coveney is set to tell Ministers  a no-deal Brexit  is more likely now than at any time to date. Photograph: Michelle DevanePA Ministers will face “dire” warnings on Tuesday about the realities of a no-deal Brexit when they are expected to discuss the implications for the Border if the UK crashes out of the EU in October. The Cabinet will hear about the “dire consequences for Northern Ireland and the all-Ireland economy” according to sources familiar with the memorandums to be presented to Ministers. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is due to bring three Brexit memos to Cabinet, including a revised contingency action plan which will be published later on Tuesday. The Government is increasingly concerned about how it can reconcile the twin obligations to maintain an open border on the island while at the same time protecting the single market and customs union if the UK leaves without an agreement. Mr Coveney warned: “We can’t allow . . . Northern Ireland effectively to become a back door – if it’s unguarded – into the EU single market and customs union. Because if that happens then the Republic of Ireland will essentially get taken out of the single market by default and we can never allow that to happen.” The Taoiseach said tariffs and customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit would not need Border checks but that checks on food products and animals were a difficulty. “We’ve made no preparations for infrastructure,” he said. Tourism and medicineThe contingency plan, about 100-pages long, is an update of the plan published last December before the previous Brexit deadline of March 29th. It will cover preparations in about 20 areas, including aviation, road haulage, retail, tourism and medicines. There will also be a memo describing preparations at ports and airports. According to sources familiar with its content, the memo will approve the permanent structures at airports and ports, including Dublin and Rosslare Europort. The third memo will outline communications plans required to inform businesses and the public about the implications of a no-deal Brexit – an outcome Mr Coveney will tell Ministers is more likely now than at any time in the past. Officials are concerned that while there was a take-up of Brexit preparations and requirements in advance of the March deadline – which passed when the UK was granted an extension – there has been a fall-off in Brexit preparations by businesses since then. UK break-upOne source said the Government needed to make “an absolute wake-up call” to business, especially small and medium-sized businesses. A campaign to prompt holders of UK driving licences to apply for Irish licences is already under way.Meanwhile, the chair of Westminster’s Northern Ireland Affairs committee has warned unionists that a hard border after Brexit could lead to a united Ireland and the break-up of the United Kingdom. Conservative MP Simon Hoare said it was a huge risk to presuppose that “the cards will all fall in our favour” over Brexit in relation to the Border.“We will play with fire if a policy is pursued which adds an accelerant to a demand for a Border poll. Because I have to say, and it saddens me to say it, I am not convinced that we as unionists would win that poll,” he said“I am also certain that even if we were to prevail and that precious union was to maintain it would open yet again – and one could not refuse the request for a second independence referendum in Scotland, and it is worrying – and I say this as somebody who is saddened to say it, I do not want to wake up and find myself a subject of the United Kingdom of England and Wales.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

There is absolutely a perception among students, echoed by teachers, that getting top grades in languages is difficult and is more difficult than other subjects.”Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, says the status quo is \u0026#34unacceptable\u0026#34He said this is not an unreasonable calculation to make, adding that parents also advise their children against languages on this basis. They are making the same sort of calculation: What is going to enable my child to as successful as possible?What will be the best passport to the next stage?Entries for GCSEs in both French and German have dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent, according to figures compiled by the British Council for its annual language trends report. The report, published earlier this week, showed that in 2014, there were 166,167 entries for French GCSE and 60,362 for German but by 2018, this had dropped to 117,046 and 42,296 respectively.Mr Buchanan said that the status quo is “unacceptable”, adding: “Whether its Ofqual or someone else - unless we do something, languages will die. There won’t be students who want to take them, and over time there won’t be enough teachers to teach them”.This summer is the second year that students have taken revamped GCSE exams in modern foreign languages (MFL).The new courses were part of a package of reforms by Michael Gove, the former education secretary, designed to toughen up syllabuses, make courses more linear, and cut down on the number of students getting A*s.Ofqual, the exam regulator, is currently undertaking a review of the reformed GCSE MFL subjects, which is due to conclude this autumn.It said it is “aware of statistical evidence” that suggests that GCSE MFL subjects may be “more severely graded than many others”.However, the watchdog said that this alone is not necessarily enough to “justify a change to grading standards”.An Ofqual spokesperson said that their research so far suggests that the new GCSEs are “functioning well”, but added that it takes concerns about the perceived difficulty of MFL subjects “seriously” and it “continues to look at this issue in detail”.They added: “We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of grading standards in GCSE French, German and Spanish, looking at statistical evidence, contextual data including trends in the numbers taking these subjects and the quality of students’ work, to see if there is compelling case for an adjustment to grading standards in these subjects.”Tory leadership latest news: Bluster is not a negotiating strategy, says Jeremy Hunt camp in searing attack on Boris JohnsonDonald Trump brands Sir Kim Darroch a \u0026#39very stupid guy\u0026#39 and a \u0026#39pompous fool\u0026#39 as ambassador dropped from meeting with IvankaThree Labour peers quit over party\u0026#39s \u0026#39institutional anti-Semitism\u0026#39 as insiders warn \u0026#39dam is bursting\u0026#39Texan billionaire Ross Perot, who took two runs at US presidency, dies at 89Queen reproves offer of help to plant tree, saying \u0026#39no, no, I\u0026#39m still perfectly capable\u0026#39 £45k a year florist job saves convicted drug dealer from prisonChinese and Indian workers in the UK earn more than white British counterparts, first ethnic pay gap data revealsBackground checks should be required to buy \u0026#39potentially lethal\u0026#39 drones, MPs toldAlternative for Germany faces election \u0026#39disaster\u0026#39 over paperwork errorVIP sex abuse \u0026#39fantasist\u0026#39 put down  deposit for a Ford Mustang day after receiving £22,000 compensation, court hears Gym goer died after 60kg barbell dropped onto his chest during workout, inquest hearsWashington DC hit by flash floods amid record rainfallComment: Brexit is not easy, but our straightforward plans can keep the Irish border free-flowing Comment: Labour was once a tolerant and erse party.

There are germs on the moon, we come back, the command module is full of lunar germs. The command module lands in the Pacific Ocean, and what do they do? Open the hatch. You got to open the hatch! All the damn germs come out!”Buzz Aldrin made a similar point as footage showed the astronauts being disinfected as they were on a raft next to the spacecraft they’d splashed down to Earth on.He said that the rescuers had cleaned him down with a rag – and then thrown that same rag straight into the water.“It takes all those germs to the bottom of the ocean,” he says in the interview, laughing. “I wonder if they’d survive down there?”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now it’s found the answer. Retreat, retrench, stop trying to be Goldman Sachs in a different time zone. Its acceptance of reality is biting hard. One in five jobs are going, with a disproportionate number disappearing from places like London, where the activities popularly known as “casino capitalism” are carried out. Share trading and the like. Deutsche Bank to slash 18,000 jobs with London roles at riskThe bank says it still plans to maintain a “significant presence” in the City. But that’s like Norwich, Aston Villa or Sheffield United saying they plan to have a significant presence in the Premier League. That’s not a knock on the three promoted teams. It’s simply a reflection of the fact that none of them will be challenging the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United or London’s footballing giants for Champions League places.In the same vein, Deutsche will no longer be challenging Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan or Merrill Lynch for top positions in the various investment banking league tables that are produced.In reality, it hasn’t really been on their level for some time in the midst of the semi permanent crisis it has been experiencing over the last few years. But it’s still had the trappings, including 8,000 people working in London. Those trappings are now going and so are lots of the people as part of plans to cut the global workforce by 18,000. Deutsche’s retreat leaves Barclays basically standing alone as the last European institution trying to go toe to toe with Wall Street. There are those who have been talking about this as an opportunity for the blue eagle to fly into the space vacated by its rival. In reality it will be just one of a number of vultures seeking to pick over the corpse. Just because Barclays shares Deutsche’s time zone doesn’t mean it will win the battle for the choicest cuts. And Barclays itself faces questions over the future of its investment bank, which was built up by Bob Diamond. Remember him? It has Ed Bramson, the activist investor, sitting on its shareholder register, agitating for a break up. He hasn’t managed to get much traction with his arguments and his attempt to force his way on to the board this year was a failure.  Created with Sketch.

As well as reducing the prices, it will offer extra discounts to students.The MacBook Air has been updated to bring True Tone technology to its existing retina display, allowing it to adapt to the light around it and make the screen appear more natural. It also had its price dropped to £1,099, and can be bought more cheaply by university students.It also updated the cheapest version of the MacBook Pro, which is 13-inches. That computer has traditionally been distinct from the other MacBook Pro models for not having the Touch Bar display that sits at the top of the keyboard – but it now has that technology, as well as Touch ID, a True Tone display of its own, Apple\u0027s newest security chip and the option to get processors that make the computer more than twice as fast as it was before.Neither of the updates made any references to Apple\u0027s widely criticised keyboard, which is said to be changing with future computers. It is likely that the new models have the controversial butterfly keyboard, though previous updates have made minor updates to try and fix some of users\u0027 problems with its keys.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.126 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

It came into existence in 2006, with the famous polycarbonate model that would go on to become a fan favourite, and it was discontinued in 2012.Apple then revived the name for its tiny computer in 2015, bringing it back with an entirely new look. It was re-introduced as the thinnest and lightest of Apple\u0027s computers, with some arguing the branding was confusing given that the MacBook Air was no longer the smallest in the company\u0027s line-up.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.126 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

But it also included Apple\u0027s new butterfly keyboards, which are now on every MacBook and have received intense criticism from users, with rumours suggesting they could soon be killed off too.The MacBook is far from the first of Apple\u0027s legacy and well-known brands to be discontinued this year. Just last month, it announced that it would be doing away with iTunes, and splitting its functions into a set of new and separate apps focused on music, podcasts and TV.Apple updates MacBook Air and Pro and drops priceAs it got rid of the MacBook, Apple also killed off the old version of the MacBook Air, which had been on sale for years and remained a cheap way of getting an Apple computer but had a variety of old components.Apple appears to now see the MacBook Air as the entry-level computer that will replace the thin and small MacBook. As it announced the death of the MacBook model, it reduced the price of the Air to $1,099, apparently to ensure its place as the cheapest of Apple\u0027s computers.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A number of economists believe the economy contracted in the second quarter.The pound fell to equal $1.25 and 1.11 euro, with both rates below earlier six-month lows. Against the dollar, sterling was within striking distance of an April 2017 low below $1.24. It very briefly hit that low in January this year in chaotic trading during a currency market flash crash.Sterling’s losses have been compounded by a strengthening dollar after receding expectations of an imminent interest rate cut in the US.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersAdam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, noted that betting markets were now pricing in a 95 per cent chance of Boris Johnson becoming prime minister.

Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM, said the currency might fall further “should the prospect of a no-deal Brexit ramp up meaningfully over the coming months.Official data on UK economic output in May, due on Wednesday, will provide more clarity on whether the economy shrank in the second quarter after a series of disappointing business surveys.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here we take look at the Duke of Edinburghs le.Prince Philip, otherwise known as the Duke of Edinburgh, is the husband of Queen Elizabeth II - and is about to celebrate his th birthday.His father was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, while his mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg.Philip was born on June , , in Corfu, Greece, but his family was exiled when he was just a child.Raised in the UK, he was also educated in France and Germany, later joining the Navy and serving in World War II.A keen sports fan, he has been involved in a number of events including developing the equestrian event of carriage driving.He has also been the patron of hundreds of organisations, often attending events with the Queen as part of their royal duties.But it hasnt all been smooth sailing - with Prince Philip known for being one of the most gaffe-prone members of the royal family.In May , it was announced that he would be retiring from public engagements, having attended  days of engagements in .The Duke of Edinburgh formally retired on August , , bowing out with a parade of Royal Marine commandos at Buckingham Palace.He now takes more of a back seat role, although he occasionally appears alongside other royals at public events.On January , , Philip was left conscious but shocked and very, very shaken after his Land Rover flipped during a shocking crash near the Sandringham estate.The fiercely independent royal, , was uninjured after the x he was driving was T-boned and then overturned on the A at Babingley, Norfolk, at pm.But two days later, he received a warning from police after he was snapped driving without a seatbelt.A police spokesman said: We are aware of the photographs.Suitable words of advice have been given to the driver and this is in line with our standard response when being made aware of our receiving such images showing this type of offence.It was revealed on January , , that the seat belt alarms in Prince Philip and the Queens Land Rovers were reportedly deactivated.They were turned off to make it easier to drive without one, it was claimed.A source said Jaguar Land Rover was instructed to disable the seat belt alarm on vehicles supplied to the royals.They went on: “It’s so that the driver doesn’t have the continuous warning beepsthey don’t wear a seatbelt.”Land Rovers for royals have their seatbelt alarms turned off to make it easier to drive without one, it was claimed.Road campaigners said he was “disrespecting” the public and had to wear one — eventhe alarm is turned off.He gave up his licence in April .In April  he was admitted to hospital for a planned hip operation scheduled for the following day.He had missed several public events in the previous weeks, including an Easter church service in Windsor.Ten days after his successful surgery, his daughter Princess Anne visited him in hospital, with the Queen revealing that he was getting on very well as he learned to walk again.Prince Philip joined the Royal Navy in  when he was just .He graduated from the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth before going on to serve in World War II.Appointed a midshipman at the start of , Philip served on the battleship HMS Ramillies, later being posted on HMS Kent and HMS Shropshire.He was later commissioned as a sub-lieutenant before going on to be promoted as a lieutenant in July .Just months later, he became the first lieutenant of HMS Wallace - making him one of the youngest in that position in the Royal Navy at just  years old.He ultimately reached the rank of commander in .Philip also holds a number of honorary ranks including Captain General of the Royal Marines.He was appointed Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom in .Philip Mountbatten married Elizabeth II in .The pair had been writing to each other for years previously, having first met in .The couple became engaged after seeking permission from Elizabeths father King George VI.After a five-month engagement, the pair were married on November , .They have four children - Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - as well as eight grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.  Prince Philip has been a patron of more than  organisations, serving as chairman of the Duke of Edinburghs Awards.Some organisations he has served as patron for include:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And to honour the result of the EU referendum.If you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that.Sadly I have not been able to do so. I tried three times - I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high.May survived a vote of no confidence in December , but repeated thwarted attempts to pass her Brexit deal left her without authority.May will remain as Prime Minister until a new party leader is announced in the week beginning July ."},{"url":null,"title":"gchq secret office shipping container","story":"But what from the outside looks like ordinary shipping container, is actually hiding a dazzling array of secret gadgets for British spies.The Sun Online has had the first look inside UK spy agency GCHQs field office for agents in war zones.It contains enough classied technology to start World War  - and even has a supply of Pot Noodles to keep our spies fed.Clues as to the work that field officers do – and the dangerous places they can be based – are strewn across the desk.Giant servers hum in the corner, and in the door are destructive tools, ready at any moment to destroy all the equipment inside the office in case their base in war zones is breached.Flashing servers sit in a TEMPEST cage, a physical shield which hides GCHQs signals that might reveal confidential data.A satellite dish sits on top of the reinforced container to provide a communications link between bases.And as a reminder of the dangerous territory these field offices can sit in, an escape hatch can be seen in the corner for officers needing to flee at any moment, with body armour stashed in a corner to protect the workers, isolated on frontline bases, during any attacks.A fictional, report funnelled to GCHQ staff sits on the computer, reading: Operation YELLOW BOX is the investigation into a group of extremists planning attacks against UK forces in Afghanistan.According to previous GCHQ reporting, an unidentied male located in the Helmand Province has ties to known extremists. According to collateral TOP SECRET, he has been linked to possible attack planning in Kandahar province.Its an example of the type of information the officers would receive before passing it onto the military to take action.The Governments electronic eavesdropping agency have used these field offices across remote military bases in the early days of missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, providing the military with intelligence as they monitored threats like the Taliban.The information would help stop plots to target British convoys and foil physical or digital threats to the UK.And it was these offices that were part of the biggest overseas deployment since the Second World War as they organised listening posts across southern Afghanistan.The work of the GCHQ in Afghanistan was only revealed in  when they flew out more than  tonnes of equipment - equivalent to  shipping containers worth.The staggering amounts of equipment was six times more kit than the agency deployed during Britain’s post- Iraq campaign.Speaking to the Sun Online, a government communications officer – who can only be known as Fi – revealed how they would work up to  hours in the steel container during top secret missions.She said: “We can be up and running with top secret communications as soon as we arrive in dferent locations.“We provide the right intelligence to the military they need to keep them safe.”The huge containers can even be choppered into site thanks to huge Chinooks.And she said the shipping containers were designed to fit in at any base camp or field office, giving no hint as to the vital work going on inside.Body armour: This body armour is ready to be grabbed at any moment, to be worn in military bases during a time of attackDestructive tools: In case the secure base was breached, GCHQ officers were given training as to how to destroy the contents of the shipping container to ensure it did not fall into the wrong handsDiplomatic bag: These plain bags would be used to carry sensitive information around the campEscape hatch: In case of an emergency, officers would be able to scramble through the emergency exit hatchGt vouchers: These tokens are used in camps like Camp Bastian in Afghanistan as a form of changeOn Her Majesty’s Service envelopes: Information would be posted in these envelopesPink discman: The servers would make constant noise, with officers using music to block out the consistent humKeep Calm and Carry on poster: Homely touches helped to make officers feel more comfortable in the foreign surroundingsCup of Noodles: Working such long hours, sugar and food would always be in constant supply in the officesMaps: Part of the work done by GCHQ officers was to ensure the military knew as much as possible about ongoing missions or what was happening in certain areasDiarrhea tablets: According to communications officer Fi, this was one of the facts of le while based overseasFly paper and jungle formula:  In the baking heat of some bases, keeping the pests at bay with insect repellent was importantWater purication tablets: Sometimes supplies could be in short supply, meaning water puritcation tablets were extremely important for workersTemperature gauge: High temperatures in the field are kept in check in the field office, with sensitive computer equipment needing to be kept between  and CFi, who was deployed to Afghanistan three times for stints of five to seven months and Iraq for  weeks, said she had remained determined to do her work throughout.She said: “I think about why we are out there, we are there to support the military.“On the worst days, you think about what you are doing and that gives you quite a bit of motivation to get out of bed. You’re part of the team.”The GCHQ had been established after the First World War, known as the Government Code and Cypher School until .Responsible for breaking the German Enigma codes, its work has continued to see it gather information and secures the UKs own communications.And the work has changed from cold war-era listening posts to include digital surveillance - monitoring increasingly cyber threats posed by countries like Russia, North Korea and China.Most recently, the GCHQ revealed it had played a major part in a cyber campaign against ISIS and its propaganda.But amongst the frantic security work that goes on inside this unassuming box, touches of home are added.A Keep Calm Carry On poster is tacked on the wall, cups of noodles are piled in the corner and a scarf sits draped over the office chair.Tea and biscuits are also at the ready during the long shts and military visits.Fi said: “Earl grey and shortbread was popular – being able to give people tea and biscuits in the very British way was a way to build relationships.”A picture of a bunny rabbit sits attached to one of the servers – with the animal having been gted to one of the soldiers by a local he was teaching English.The pet, dubbed Honey Bunny, then became a camp favourite.It is these stories, and the fascinating work done by GCHQ, that will be marked in the Science Museum’s new exhibition that opens on July .GCHQ, or the Government Code  Cypher Schoolas it was known at the time, was established on  November  as a peacetime cryptanalytic unit made up from staff from the Admiraltys Room  and the War Offices MI.During WWII, GCHQ staff moved to Bletchley Park where they decrypted German messages, most famously by breaking Enigma-encrypted communications, making a signicant contribution to the Allied victory.The organisation moved to Cheltenham in , and then settled into its current building, famously nicknamed the Doughnut in .They now have sites across the country, including Bude, Scarborough, Harrogate, Lincolnshire, and London, and a new facility in Manchester will be opened later this year.Jeremy Fleming, Director GCHQ said: “This unique collaboration between GCHQ and the Science Museum is a great way to mark our Centenary and give visitors previously-unseen insights into how GCHQ has helped protect the UK over the past  years.“For the first time the public will be given a glimpse into our secret history of amazing intelligence, world-leading innovation, and most of all brilliant people.“And - as the threats to the UK become more erse and more complex - it’s a chance to encourage the next generation of recruits. Because at GCHQ we believe that with the right mix of minds anything is possible.”Hannah Daley, the Science Museum’s exhibition project manager, said she was thrilled that more than one hundred items would be on display for members of the public.She said: “It’s an insight into a secret world we don’t normally get to see, and how they support the military.“There are powerful stories about how they do that work, and le their le in secret.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt pm vision britain","story":"He would use his negotiating experience to extract a better Brexit deal and take us out of the EU.

It’s dead.The sensible compromise to avoid a turbulent No Deal is surely a time limit on the backstop. A short deadline would focus minds here, in Ireland and Brussels on reaching a swt free trade deal negating border checks almost entirely.It also stands a chance of passing in the Commons.Trouble is, it would mean the EU giving up on reversing Brexit or trapping us in its customs union.

Perhaps they feel aggrieved by the bad publicity and have decided to pull up the drawbridge to keep us all out today.It doesn’t work like that.Diana, who knew all about public perception and how to deal with the media, would have advised them to counteract the criticism by making sure that Archie’s christening was an event the whole country could enjoy.There would have been no question of the names of godparents being kept secret, or photos of such a big occasion only being released on Harry and Meghan’s carefully controlled Instagram account.Diana would have known that images of a cute baby and his doting parents, with guests all done up to the nines, would take the heat off the negative stories surrounding the Frogmore building work.I’m sure Meghan has been bruised by some of the, frankly, racist and utterly vile comments on social media, as well as the upsetting and ongoing feud with her family — apart from her mum, Doria.Not even Diana would have been able to silence those hideous trolls, but her wise counsel would have stopped the Markle clan from being a thorn in Meghan’s side.Even before the engagement announcement, Diana would have flown over to the USA and entranced Thomas Markle.I have no doubt Diana would have given him a masterclass in dealing with the media.There would have been no clumsy staged paparazzi shots and Thomas Markle would have proudly walked his daughter down the aisle.Diana, would have been on hand with advice about the announcement of baby Archie’s arrival, which was all a bit messy.She would have been a staunch ally to Meghan and helped her navigate the choppy waters of royal protocol, and been a terric sounding board for any worries the new mum might encounter.Diana would have been a cheerleader for Harry and Meghan’s plans to make a dference both here and in Africa and supported their plans to spend half the year in Botswana with baby Archie, albeit with assurances that “Granny Di” could pop over for regular visits.I understand Harry and Meghan want to protect their little boy and allow him to grow up leading as “normal” a le as possible, but they really can’t have it both ways.Either they are private citizens and pay for their own loft extension, or they are royals and have to share the big events in their lives with the rest of the world. Diana would have helped them achieve that balance.It’s a crying shame she isn’t here, but I truly hope Harry and Meghan have a joyful time today and maybe even change their minds and give us all a peek at the celebrations.FIFTY years ago, Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon and the world was in awe.As a ten-year-old watching this “giant leap for mankind” I genuinely believed that we had taken the first small step into the unknown and were boldly going “where no one had gone before”.I did a primary school project on the first manned voyage to Mars, which we reckoned would take place in  –  nothing seemed impossible.In the years before the Moon landing, we watched Star Trek and thought we’d be living that TV series for real.There was to have been a lunar base, and from there we would explore the solar system and eventually the rest of the universe.Of course none of this came to pass, except in our imaginations and sci-fi films.Scientists had the curiosity and the imagination but, sadly, the general public lost interest.After the space shuttle disasters in  and  that killed  crew members, politicians got cold feet and the manned missions were shelved.This loss of le was tragic but, ever since we started exploring space, astronauts have always paid the ultimate price.Even the Apollo  Moon landing came close to disaster.This week sees the release of Armstrong, an astonishing documentary about the first man on the Moon.Watching the footage, you will gain a new-found respect for this rare breed of human beings.Hopefully it will ignite a new passion among this current generation to once again travel into space.If we don’t seek out “new le and new civilisations”, then what are we actually here for THE biggest kid of all in the le of Coleen Rooney would appear to be her husband.She’s ed home with her four boys and left Wayne in the US with a list of strict instructions most mums would leave for their stroppy teenage sons.Wayne has been warned that there is to be no boozing, no wild parties and he has to phone Coleen every day to check in with her so she can be reassured he really is behaving himself.No wonder the poor lass has to have so many holidays.Looking after FIVE boisterous boys must be utterly exhausting.I AM more than a little bit in love with Suranne Jones as “Gentleman Jack”.This cracking drama based on the real-le th century lesbian Anne Lister is witty, wicked and, at times, impossibly sad.Anne was a bold pioneer trying to find her place in le.At a time when women were kept firmly in their place and either treated like imbeciles or fragile pieces of bone china, she was a sharp businesswoman who owned her own land and took no s**t.When it came to matters of the heart, however, Anne was achingly vulnerable and badly let down by the women she loved.It’s the last episode tomorrow but,you have missed out, you can catch up on BBC iPlayer and a second series has already been commissioned.CAROL Vorderman has the sort of figure that would make Jessica Rabbit turn pea green with envy – proper gorgeous, voluptuous curves.She told me it’s all down to doing thousands of squats, walking for miles in the countryside and the side-effects of the menopause.Under that regime, most of us would end up with rock-hard flat buttocks, sore feet and horric night sweats.GAIL Porter famously once had her derrière beamed on to the Houses of Parliament.It actually made a refreshing change to see a backside on the outside of the building, instead of the usual arses who inhabit the interior.Back then, Gail was at the height of her fame as a TV presenter and lads’ mag favourite.It looked as though she was living the dream, but the poor girl was suffering horribly inside.She’s had well documented mental health issues including being diagnosed as bipolar, and suffering with anorexia and anxiety.At one point, in deep despair, she even tried to take her own le.Possibly due to all the stress, Gail’s hair fell out and never grew back.It’s not been an easy road, but I am delighted this irrepressible and beautul woman has bounced back.She’s now in a good place and keen to help others who have been through similar experiences.Gail has teamed up with The Samaritans, an organisation that has helped her in the past, to ask us all to take part in a marathon.The good news is you can take the whole of July to reach  miles.That’s under a mile a day and you can run, jog or walk.Build up your miles in your nearest park, going to work on foot or just out for a stroll.For more information on the Samarathon, see Samaritans.org. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, really.Christine Lagarde, replacing Mario Draghi as European Central Bank president, was a proud cheerleader for Project Fear in her role as head of the International Monetary Fund, predicting the UK’s collapsewe dared vote for Brexit.And Charles Michel, the lame duck Belgium Prime Minister replacing Donald Tusk as EU Council President, has consistently dismissed Brexit as a contemptible little “soap opera”.Come back, Jean-Claude Drunker — all is forgiven!I have seen these appointments described as a “huge headache” for the next British Prime Minister.On the contrary, having an elite of Brexit-bashing, Brit-loathing Eurocrats spitting their federalist poison at us makes leaving the EU inevitable.Nothing is more likely to finally get us out of the European Union than having a sneering, bossy rabble of democracy-denying nonentities wagging their fingers in our faces.I wouldn’t trust the EU Ayatollahs to run a whelk stall.Charles Michel’s major claim to fame is that he became Belgium’s youngest ever PM in , despite his party coming third in the elections.Christine Lagarde was convicted of criminal negligence in  over a financial scandal in France but spared jail time and allowed to keep her job.She is the first female head of the European Central Bank and also the first who has no background in economics.Despite her eight years as head of the IMF, Lagarde is a lawyer and a politician. So best of luck saving the Euro, Christine.Ursula von der Leyen’s nomination as EU Commission President has provoked outrage in her native Germany, where it is perceived as an undeserved reward for miserable failure.Frau von der Leyen’s six years as defence minister earned her the reputation as “the worst minister in Germany” and being promoted to President of the EU Commission is seen as getting “kicked upstairs” by her friend, Chancellor Angela Merkel.Certainly there is nothing on Ursula’s CV to warrant such a promotion.As defence minister, Frau von der Leyen prioritised creches and flexible working hours for Germany’s armed forces.Funding shortages became so dire on her watch that on a Nato training exercise in Norway, German troops were obliged to use broomsticks painted black instead of guns.I don’t fancy her EU army’s chances against the Russians.But I would bet they have childcare facilities to die for.Unelected by the people, unaccountable to the people and contemptuous of the people, this next generation of Eurocrats remind us why the British have no future inside this arrogant empire.Yes, Brexit has been an agony.But the appointment of the EU’s new Ayatollahs prove that remaining is unthinkable.BRIAN JONES, the original Rolling Stone, died  years ago this week.“No Jones, no Stones,” said Bill Wyman. “He formed the band.

But this was not a battlefield, it was a housing estate. A lot of friends were killed.“When you are on tour in a conflict zone such as Northern Ireland you have to remain switched on the whole time. When you leave the Army there is no off switch.“There is supposed to be a covenant for the Armed Forces whereby the Government provides the support we need.“But lots of soldiers get into a vicious circle due to mental health issues because they don’t receive help.“When you were out on patrol the last thing you’d admit to is being scared, so soldiers don’t always ask for support. We need to make sure the authorities are looking for signs early on.“In many ways I am lucky, because I have my own house, I’m happily married, I have a day job running a post room and a weekend job as a singer.“But  years after I left the Army I started to get symptoms of PTSD, which my we recognised before I noticed anything.“I suffered nightmares, started drinking to excess and started to do things which were out of character, such as challenging people on the Underground and going to dodgy pubs on my own, looking for danger.“I think it was Northern Ireland coming to the front of my head. Eventually I agreed to go and ask for support, and the we found a charity called Combat Stress who were willing to assess me.“I was lucky I caught it early and I haven’t needed to go back for any therapy for five years.“But I know many veterans are not so fortunate to have received that kind of treatment.”SAS hero Bob Curry stormed the Iranian Embassy to rescue hostages – but last year he was refused a council house when he was made homeless.The -year-old, who helped to save  lives during the London siege in , had lost his house in Hereford after his business collapsed and he split up with his partner.He says: “When I lost my home the council wouldn’t even put me on the housing list – they told me I didn’t qualy. They were so arrogant.“In a private meeting one housing officer asked me, ‘Have you been out of the military five years ’ and when I said ‘Yes’, he threw his pencil across the table, held his arms and huffed.“In Hereford, because I had been out of the military for five years, I was no longer considered to be a veteran.“I said to them, ‘All of those men and women standing at the Cenotaph on the th of the th aren’t veterans any more ’ and he replied, ‘Not in Hereford, they’re not’.“Out of the homeless population in Britain,  per cent are veterans, and I believe there should be a dedicated officer for the ex-military in every council. I definitely back The Sun’s Veterans’ Pledge, because promises have not been kept.“Politicians talk about a covenant but when you start dealing with bureaucracy, no one cares. You have got to look after these people, because they looked after the country.“Lots of veterans on the street don’t have any paperwork.

We thought the Military Covenant had been enshrined in law, but it turns out it depends how your local area interprets it.“We also thought that veterans would get preferential referencing for medical services and things like that, but it also turns out that’s not the case. All that’s agreed is that they shouldn’t be disadvantaged.“Well, of course they shouldn’t be disadvantaged, there shouldn’t be any question of that. They should be advantaged. It’s one step forward and two back.”Diane, , adds: “The lawyers who launch witch-hunt investigations against veterans are making money out of other people’s heroism and service to their country. That’s unspeakable.“Ben left the Army this year. The bill for his rehabilitation is about £, a year and he gets £, towards that. That figure is under review but we consider ourselves lucky to have got that.“We had to threaten legal action to get it. Ben has a deep love of the Army and thinks everyone must have his best interests at heart.“Behind the scenes we’ve been fighting the MoD and it’s nearly finished me. We sold a property where we were going to retire to, to take legal action.“The funding is nowhere near enough. It’s a starting point and it gives us a chance to let Ben carry on. Ben’s happy when he’s busy but it takes a hell of a lot of support to make sure he has a le worth living.”But too often, this just isn’t the case.We hear from those we support about unacceptable waiting times for treatment, health services that don’t properly understand their needs and the sometimes devastating impacts on their wellbeing of leaving the military as a result of injury or illness.Most recently, we have been calling for veterans with complex rehabilitation needs to be given better access to the MoD’s state-of- the-art rehabilitation centre, Stanford Hall.An Office of Veterans’ Affairs would ensure all government departments are issuing policies which recognise their responsibility to those who have served, while having a Cabinet-level Minister would ensure the needs of our veterans are heard at the highest level.While the principles of the Armed Forces Covenant were enshrined in law in , there are currently no consequencesthe Covenant is not properly applied.We believe this needs to change, to properly deliver on the promise that no inidual should be disadvantaged as a result of their service in the Armed Forces.Help for Heroes has supported more than , wounded personnel and their families to date, but we know more can be done for them – which is why we believe it is vital for the Tory leadership contenders to be signed up to the Veterans’ Pledge and put the needs of wounded heroes back on the agenda.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I had no idea how sneeringly “modern feudal” the whole circus was about to become.What a dismal little VIP gathering Archie’s christening has turned out to be. A PR disaster.Harry and Meghan insisted on conducting the whole thing in secret, refusing even to reveal who his godparents were.I don’t even care who they are —they are Robbie Williams or that plastic Canadian friend of Meghan’s who looks like a Love Island reject, I’d rather not know.But why make such a snitty point of it unless he’s trolling the very people who admire him It seems so unjoyful — the opposite of what a christening is meant to be.I know what his arguments are. He wants a “normal” le for Archie. He hates the Press and the paparazzi.But the truth is the royals get a huge amount of privacy. They have far more privacy than the average citizen.They are not snapped while picking their noses at a newsagent. They are not filmed going on holiday. No one knows where they go on holiday or even where they are when they are not performing their duties.No one sells stories on their private lives or punts pictures. No one takes pictures or follows them at all, because no newspaper would carry the images.Eventhey are spotted by someone, they have huge security teams, paid for by us, to keep us at bay.The royals do not want privacy, they want a private le in public, and no one has the right to that.In spite of this, Harry appears to have gone what I would describe as the full Hugh Grant. Last week it turned out that the actor has become so obsessed with the idea that the paps were following him he confronted an Italian official who was innocently filming rubbish dumped in the street.Everywhere Harry looks, he sees people who want to take advantage of him, which is not true and leads to this sad irascibility in which he forgets what is kind and decent —  and who is paying the bill.What has become of him  If you scan Meghan and Harry’s Instagram feed, you will see how distant the “people’s prince” has turned out. There is no shortage of cloying information on how much he “cares” about alpacas and Mothering Sunday and advancing his sanctimonious “monthly social awareness approach” on mental health or climate change.

In fact, he dislikes being royal so much, he has waved through this shell of a person called “Prince Harry” operated by an American marketing droid who writes about “sharing” Harry’s “environmental POV”.There are half a million likes for a snap of the prince looking bored.Meghan has similarly vanished.If she had her way, it would not even be a christening, but a naming ceremony with fire pit curators and celebrity mixologists and D-list actresses as earth parents .She is so embarrassing I wonderedit was the godparents who had actually begged for privacy — you can just imagine Beyonce weighing up whether a second-tier royal christening was cool enough for her to openly acknowledge it.And so we have it: A royal christening in a building we paid for, conducted by a bishop whose salary we help foot, featuring royals whose lives we bankroll, in clothes we have paid for, sitting on seats we bought, waited on by staff we fund, with celebs who are not even sure they want to put their name to it.And they think they can say, “Oh, we’re not telling you anything about it” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which unless a unicorn is produced, only Remain best fits the  tests.Critics cried it was still a Labour fudge on the biggest issue facing British politics today, and MPs in Leave seats said they couldnt support it.MP Kevin Barron, who is stepping down whenever the next election is held, said: Whilst I remain an MP I will never support a second referendum in any form, the decision to leave the EU was made in  and we should respect that!Mr Corbyn still insisted that his compromise plan for Brexit - with a customs union and close relationship with the single market - was a good one.We continue to believe this is a sensible alternative that could bring the country together, he wrote in a letter to party members this morning.That could meanLabour win a snap election that they might take us out with a soft Brexit deal instead, further ripping his party in two.The news comes after a crunch meeting of Labours top team to thrash out the policy this morning, which will abandon its traditional voters in the heartlands of Britain who have loyally backed them for years.And it follows a long consultation with union bosses and Labours members too - most of whom want to Remain in the EU.MPs fear that millions of voters will now abandon the party for good and flock to the Brexit Party instead, who have made huge gains since they were set up later this year.Nigel Farages venture have taken chunks of support from both Labour and the Tories as they punish the main parties for refusing to deliver Brexit.Tories came out to slam Labours massive switch and betrayal of the historic  vote.Leadership contender Jeremy Hunt said earlier: Jeremy Corbyn has never believed in Britain. In this country we deliver the will of the people.Simon Clarke MP tweeted: People who voted to leave and then trusted what Labour told you in  about respecting your decision - you have been totally sold out.And David Jones added: If you want Brexit, you have to back Boris.The major sht shows the Labour boss has finally caved to the Remainers in his party, who have been campaigning for another Brexit referendum for months.Top members of his shadow cabinet including John McDonnell, Tom Watson and Emily Thornberry have been on his back to change stance quickly to save the partys skin.Mr McDonnell and Mr Abbott are said to have furiously confronted him in recent weeks to ditch crucial aides who are trying to block the party moving to a Remain stance.Mr Corbyn’s circle of domineering senior advisers – dubbed “the Three Ms” because of their surnames – then talked Mr Corbyn out of it.The trio are communications boss Seumas Milne, chief of staff Karie Murphy and policy guru Andrew Murray.They are currently polling at as low as  per cent in national polls.Mr Corbyn has been under huge pressure to decide on his partys stance before a snap election - which could come within weeks of the new PM coming to power.Dear member, I am proud to lead the Labour Party – the greatest political party and social movement in this country. We all recognise that the issue of Brexit has been isive in our communities and sometimes in our party too. As democrats, Labour accepted the result of the  referendum. In our  manesto, Labour also committed to oppose a No Deal Brexit and the Tories’ Brexit plans – which threatened jobs, living standards, and the open multicultural society that we as internationalists value so much. I want to pay tribute to Keir Starmer and the shadow Brexit team for holding the Government to account during this process. That helped secure a meaningful vote on their deal – which we then defeated three times – including inflicting the largest ever defeat on any Government. And following their refusal to publish their legal advice, this Government became the first to be held in contempt of Parliament. Labour set out a compromise plan to try to bring the country together based around a customs union, a strong single market relationship and protection of environmental regulations and rights at work. We continue to believe this is a sensible alternative that could bring the country together.  But the Prime Minister refused to compromise and was unable to deliver, so we ended cross-party talks. Now both Tory leadership candidates are threatening a No Deal Brexit - or at best a race to the bottom and a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump: that runs down industry, opens up our NHS and other public services to yet more privatisation, and shreds environmental protections, rights at work and consumer standards. I have spent the past few weeks consulting with the shadow cabinet, MPs, affiliated unions and the NEC. I have also had feedback from members via the National Policy Forum consultation on Brexit. Whoever becomes the new Prime Minister should have the confidence to put their deal, or No Deal, back to the people in a public vote. In those circumstances, I want to make it clear that Labour would campaign for Remain against either No Deal or a Tory deal that does not protect the economy and jobs. Labour has a crucial, historic duty to safeguard jobs, rights and living standards. But no Brexit outcome alone can do that. We need a general election. After nine years of austerity, too many people in this country cannot find decent secure well-paid work, and have to rely on public services that have been severely cut back.  Our country is ravaged by inequality and rising poverty, huge regional imbalances of investment, and the government is failing to tackle the climate emergency facing us all.  That is why we need a Labour government to end austerity and rebuild our country for the many not the few. Yours Jeremy Corbyn And the huge news for Labour comes just a day before a damning BBC Panorama programme is expected to reveal the inside story of how the party deals with anti-Semitism claims.The party has said the documentary is biased and features a string of comments from ex-staffers who have an axe to grind.Critics said the party was releasing its huge news to try and bury the bad news from the documentary."},{"url":null,"title":"david attenborough compares youth climate","story":"NewsDavid Attenborough compares youth climate action to the abolition of slaveryThe -year-old presenter said people are quickly realising that \"to chuck plastic into the ocean is an insult\"ShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video david-attenborough-praises-youth-climate-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailYoung peopleaposs views on the climate are changing so fast they can be compared to the abolition of slavery, Sir David Attenborough suggested today.

And somehow or other in the space of I suppose  or  years the public perception of that totally transformed. By the middle of the th Century it was becoming intolerable.

The pink bench, featuring unicorn designs and Aleshaaposs name, is situated at Childrenaposs Corner on Rothesayaposs promenade. But following a meeting of the Bute Community Council last month, chairwoman Marlene Hill said some island residents had requested that the bench be moved. Mary Lochrane slammed those who complained, describing them as sad sick pathetic people. In a post on social media, she said: There are people in Rothesaywho should be totally ashamed to call themselves human beings.  They are now complaining about our wee Princesses Bench and want it moved. Sad sick pathetic people thataposs all you are.

An extract from minutes at the community council meeting held on June  reads: Marlene Hill said she has been asked by a few parentsit is possible that the pink bench could be moved, as it is upsetting small children, because some of them think that someone will come into their house and murder them.    Marlene Hill said the pink bench is very prominent, and perhaps it might be better somewhere slightly out of town, facing towards the sea  The placing of flowers on benches was mentioned in general. Since then, Toni McLachlan, the girlfriend of Aleshaaposs dad Robert, vowed to chain herself to the schoolgirlaposs memorial bench before letting it be moved.

Victoria Underwood first noticed something was wrong when her son, Barron, began sleeping for longer and longer periods during the day and would suffer from night terrors and hallucinations at night. The antiques dealer took the nine-year-old to a paediatrician, who told her that it was probably due to growing pains caused by restless leg syndrome. The boy was then referred to a neurologist who suggested Barron had not been taught to self-sooth as a baby and has since been unable to get himself back to sleep. Over the next few months he continued to sleep all day every day, even falling into deep slumbers while at school.    Victoria - who grew up in Bridgend, Wales, but now lives in Tennessee, USA - decided to do some research of her own, which led her to narcolepsy - a rare long-term brain condition that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times. When the -year-old mum took Barron to be tested for the condition he fell asleep within  seconds during each of five test naps. Doctors admitted that due to his age and severity of his condition, he is unique to their practice and they had never seen a case like his before. Following his diagnosis Barron took medication which alleviated his symptoms. His teachers have helped out too by educating his classmates about narcolepsy so the young man feels less insecure.    The onset of his narcolepsy was so unexpected and sudden and seemingly without any kind of trigger that it was a weird thing to try diagnose, Victoria said. He was seven, I believe, and had spent the night at a NYE lock-in at a local high school on New Yearaposs Day he came home and slept all day and we thought he was just worn out from being up all night but as the days went on the sleeping continued. It was literally like he was fine one day and not the next but he didnapost have any kind of trauma that we think couldaposve triggered the symptoms. When we started realising something was wrong, he seemed to be sleeping anywhere from twelve to eighteen hours every day.    His need to sleep caused issues for the family, who had to avoid days out so he could get enough rest. It ruined our plans as a family because we have another son and we would want to go do things as a family, but he would just be so grumpy and tired that he would flat out refuse to leave the house, the mum continued. Itaposs been a rough journey for over a year, mostly because doctors wouldnapost listen to me when I said that I thought he had narcolepsy. His paediatrician told me that it was probably growing pains, but the leg pain continued for longer than I thought it should have. We were then sent to a neurologist who told my husband and I that basically we had done everything wrong when he was a baby and that he never learned to self-soothe and didnapost know how to get himself back to sleep, to which I thanked him and never went back.    So, for a few months we just lived with him sleeping all day and we just got used to the fact that as a family, we werenapost going to be able to go out on the boat or go out for the day because Barron would need to sleep. Victoria admits that his condition has affected the whole family and that Barron has gained more than st, increasing his weight from st Ibs to st Ib. We started going to a sleep centre who told us, after two sleep studies, that he has sleep apnoea and needed a CPAP mask which we got, but it didnapost seem to make any dference, she said. They kept trying to tell me it was sleep apnoea until I got mad and told them that I wanted the narcolepsy test done pronto. We went for the narcolepsy test and he fell asleep, into REM sleep, in under ninety seconds in all of his five naps which showed apossevere narcolepsyapos.    When we went for the results the doctor admitted that due to his age and severity that he is unique to their practice. I got the feeling that they didnapost really know how to handle him and thataposs why they kept just telling me it was apnoea. That plus itaposs fairly rare for little ones to be diagnosed with it. He was napping multiple times during the day and during a handful of his classes. His little friends started to notice that he was always asleep and not getting in trouble. They didnapost understand why they would get in trouble for doing it and say things like aposwhy am I in trouble  Bear sleeps all the time.apos The teachers at Barronaposs school read a book about a bear which sleeps a lot, helping the children to get a handle on what le as a narcoleptic is like.    The kids now understand what Bear goes through every day and they will even remind him at lunch to go take his medicine, Victoria continued.

Stephen Nicholson, of no fixed address, is accused of repeatedly stabbing -year-old Lucy in the neck and upper body at Southampton Sports Centre before leaving her to die in July last year. He is also accused of having sex with a dferent underage girl who spoke at Winchester Crown Court today.

After growing up together in Preston, Lancashire, the two women spoke every day on the phone and shared all the details of their lives with each other. Donna said: “Vicky was older than me, and she looked after me and mothered me. I really looked up to her. If she liked a band, I liked them too. If she dyed her hair, I’d do mine the same. I idolised her. “As we got older, we’d go out together and we became such good friends.    “Vicky had a very troubled up-bringing and she had her problems. But she had a heart of gold.” When Vicky began a relationship with Andrew Colin Reade following the tragic death of her first husband, Donna instantly knew there was something very troubling about him. And when Vicky confided in her that Reade was treating her badly, Donna, knowing her cousin was vulnerable after being recently widowed, told her she was there to help. Finally Vicky had enough and told Donna she was leaving him. Desperate to support her best friend, Donna told Vicky she and her three children to move in with her, feeling relieved that her cousin would finally be happier. But despite their plans, for two weeks Donna could not get hold of her cousin and she started to worry. She could not imagine the horror that was to come. Reade later admitted to concealing the body of his partner, -year-old Vicky, who had not been seen alive since October .  Her body was hidden inside an airing cupboard for  months as Reade claimed to friends she had left him and moved out. He was arrested on suspicion of murder but claimed he found her dead in bed next to her. Reade was jailed for four years and four months in June  after he admitted preventing a lawful burial and perverting justice. Neighbours told an inquest that they recalled a strange odour inside the one-bedroom flat and revealed how Reade tried to cover it up with air-freshener when they were invited round. A Domestic Homicide Review published at the end of June revealed failings by the police and other agencies who ought to have been looking her. Now Vicky’s cousin, Donna Gregory, who was best pals with the tragic mum for many years, has spoken of her heartbreak. Donna, , says: “I was the last known person to speak to Vicky before her death. I carried her coffin at her funeral but we were told there was very little left of her. It was sickening. “She had such an undignied, horrible death. The very least she deserved was a proper burial. It infuriates me that Reed has got off so lightly. “I blame myself, because she was supposed to come and live with me she was days away from a new start. Maybe I could have saved her.  “And maybe the authorities could have saved her tooanything good can come of her death it should be that lessons are learned and other women are better protected.”  Vicky had three children while Donna had fivebut in , Vicky’s husband, Steve Cherry, died from an epileptic fit and she was devastated. Donna said: “She really struggled after Steve died, and she went through a tough time. She self-medicated with drugs.” The following year, Vicky began a relationship with Andrew Reed. The couple met at a New Year’s Eve party. Donna says: “I met Andrew just once, at our grandmother’s funeral, and I disliked him immediately. He and Vicky appeared very close but I later realised it was because he was so possessive and he wouldn’t let her out of his sight. “She confided in me that they were arguing a lot and I was worried about her. She said he wasn’t treating her very well. She was quite vulnerable and I wish now, looking back, I had done more to try to talk her into leaving him, there and then.” One week before she went missing, in October , Vicky called Donna and askedshe could go and live with her.  Little did she know it was the last time she would ever speak to Vicky. She was the last known person to have any contact with her. Donna says: Vicky told me she’d had enough of Andrew. We made plans for her to come and live with me. I was looking forward to it, and I knew she’d be much happiershe was single again.  I called and texted her constantly and she just didn’t reply. In the end, I was actually annoyed with her. I thought she had decided to stay with Andrew and she just didn’t want to tell me. I sent her a message to say: ‘I presume you’ve changed your mind and you’re sticking with him. You could at least have let me knowapos. I was really angry. I called Vicky’s mum, Jan, and she hadn’t hear from her either. But we knew Vicky had a chaotic lestyle and we just expected her to turn up at some point. But Vicky seemed to have disappeared. Donna said: “I began to worry I asked around and nobody knew where she was. I called the police but they didn’t seem to take it seriously they went to the house but couldn’t find her.” Police launched an appeal but the case seemed to make no progress. Donna said: “Vicky had vanished into thin air. We couldn’t work it out. I was so worried about her as time went on, I knew she had to be dead. It was the only explanation.”  In January , Vicky’s body was found in a cupboard at her home and Reade was arrested on suspicion of murder. Donna said: I was preparing myself that she was dead. But I could never have been prepared for what had happened to her. The police had found her body, stuffed in a cupboard, underneath old bike parts.  In June that same year, Andrew Colin Reade, , pleaded guilty to concealing Vicky’s body for  months and preventing her burial. The cause of death could not be ascertained because she had so badly decomposed. But a pathologist concluded she may have died as a result of strangulation as injuries to her neck were detected. Reade claimed he had panicked after he woke to find his girlfriend dead after they had taken a cocktail of illicit drugs. He had wrapped the body in a duvet and plastic sheeting and hidden it in a cupboard. Reade admitted intending to pervert the course of justice by giving misleading and inaccurate information about the whereabouts of Victoria to police officers, pharmacists, and family members. He had cashed in employment benefits totalling up to £, sent to Vicky in the three months after her death.  Reade was jailed for four years and four months at Bolton Crown Court. He refused to attend the inquest into her death in November that year and an open verdict was recorded. A report, published at the end of June, revealed that police and other agencies involved with Vicky and Andrew Reade did not consider the possibility of domestic abuse and did not communicate well enough with each other. Four months after the discovery of Vicky’s body Bolton’s Be Safe Strategic Partnership decided to conduct a review into how organisations dealt with the couple in order to establish any lessons which can be learnt for the future. It found that Reade’s previous history as a domestic abuser was not sufficiently recognised or information shared between agencies such as the former Bolton Integrated Drug and Alcohol Service , GPs, Bolton at Home, the National Probation Service and the Community Rehabilitation Company.

For months the village near Stockton has been plagued by a horrendous fine wood chip-like covering of dust - leaving residents feeling forgotten and angry. Residents say the dust settles on tree branches and window sills across the village, and leaves a thick layer on cars by the end of the day and even blowing in through vehicle air filters.Samples of the dust have been taken by Stockton Council, with nearby energy plant owner Stobart and the Health and Safety Executive also involved, Teeside Live reports.Stobart Energy said following council investigations, the dust is not believed to have come from its site, however the company is continuing to support the school in their investigations. But High Clarence Primary School head Jean Orridge says enough is enough. She claims pupilsapos health is at risk and sheaposs prepared to take drastic actionthe issue isnapost resolved as soon as possible.    She said: Itaposs like a fine wood dust, when the moisture gets on it, it goes into a pulp. Itaposs in school, on the trees, buildings, itaposs everywhere. It can be quite thick on the cars by the end of the day. Residents say itaposs on their window sills, a fine coating. The children are suffering. Skin complaints, eye irritations, respiratory coughs seem to be more apparent. Iaposm no analyst, lots of people have taken little bags away. And we still have no answer. Until we determine which company it is, we wonapost know what action can be taken. This is not fair on either the school, the children and the community and has gone on long enough. The school, which dates back to , has an air handling unit which brings fresh air into the building. This is not happening, Jean added, as we are drawing dust into school. Billingham town councillor, Jenner Shotton, said her throat felt grainy and eyes were dry after spending an hour there herself. I have seen it settled on school playgrounds and railings, cars, inside shops and streets, she added. Dogs are going to the vets with eye irritation, the manager of the chip shop is near to breaking point, and people are feeling forgotten and angry. A spokesperson for Stockton Council said: “Following concerns raised by the school we are carrying out some monitoring from the school site. The first samples have been sent off for analysis while the monitoring continues.”  Stobart Energy maintains it has spent more than £.m on emissions management and monitoring for its biomass plant, which opened in September . Misting cannons are used to provide a blanket of moisture on residual dust, and regular inspections, road sweeping and monitoring of wind direction is also carried out. A Stobart Energy spokesman added: Stobart Energy has pro-actively engaged with Stockton Council to investigate the source of the dust being found at the school. Following that investigation, Stockton Council did not believe that dust is originating from our site and is continuing to investigate the cause. However, we take our role as a key stakeholder in the area extremely seriously and will continue to support the school in their investigations. Since establishing our site, we have maintained regular dialogue with our local stakeholders, and intend to meet with the school tomorrow.” "},{"url":null,"title":"paul gascoigne backflips over quad","story":"NewsPaul Gascoigne backflips over quad bike after hitting boulder in Benidorm crashEngland football legend Paul Gazza Gascoigne, , hit a boulder and was sent flying off the bikeShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video paul-gascoigne-filmed-singing-sectarian-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPaul Gascoigne has been involved in a quad bike crash while on holiday in Benidorm.

It comes as Gazza has been soaking up the Spanish sun on the trip organised by his manager Shane Whitfield. He has been sharing a number of holidays snaps of his adventures, including swimming naked, riding a jet-ski and playing golf.

The keen sportsman invested in contact lenses to help improve his vision while playing football. But while he was taking a shower after a gym session a parasite burrowed into his eyeball. Nick contracted Acanthamoeba keratitis , a rare parasitical infection in his right cornea and over the last  months has had two operations and now nees a corneal transplant.  Nick, a local newspaper journalist, said: If Iaposd have known how dangerous it was to wear contacts in the shower, I would never have got them in the first place.    After getting the infection, I went from hitting the gym every other day and playing football three times a week, to being housebound for six months and losing the will to live. I got contacts as I didnapost like how I looked in glasses and it nearly cost me my right eye. Nick, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, had worn glasses since he was four but in  he wanted to improve his sight while playing sport and got contact lenses.  Fitness mad and a keen football player, Nick, who is single, said: In my mid-twenties I really started to throw myself into exercise and at the time I thought my glasses were a massive hindrance. When I finally got over my fear of putting contacts in, I thought they were the best thing ever. The -year-old only wore contacts five days a week and switched to glasses at least twice a week. But he thought nothing of getting up and popping his contacts in before heading to the gym, having a quick shower while still wearing them and then going to work. Nick said: I thought nothing of it at the time. I was never told not to wear contact lenses in the shower, thereaposs no warning on the packaging and my opticians never mentioned a risk.  He only realised something was wrong in January  when he noticed a scratch on his right eye. Despite being unable to see clearly, Nick assumed his had scratched his eye while putting his lenses in - but over the next few days his condition deteriorated. He said: For a few days I used over the counter eye drops and turned all my phone and computer display settings down to the lowest brightness, which seemed to do the trick. ut when things didnapost get any better, he visited his optician. he was diagnosed with an eye ulcer told to go to the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital immediately. There, after being seen by eye specialists, he had five scrapings from his right eye sent away to be tested. Nick said: The doctors said they couldnapost be sure what was happening until they had the test results back, but that they thought it might be Acanthamoeba keratitis . It is an infection of the cornea - the clear window at the front of the eye - caused by a microscopic organism called Acanthamoeba, which is found in water.Nick said: Iaposd never heard of the infection before, but as soon as I got home I turned to Dr Google and was suddenly left thinking I was going to have my right eyeball removed.A week later, doctors told Nick he had tested positive for AK, and he feared his football days were over. Nick said: I told the doctor that Iaposd read a few horror stories about it and askedI would need to have my eye removed.  He just looked at me and said, aposThat could well be a possibility.apos Thataposs when I realised it was serious. After using disinfectant eye drops for three weeks Nick seemed to be getting better but in March  he suddenly found himself completely blind in his right eye. He said: I was driving to work and my vision completely went in my right eye. I donapost know how I managed not to crash, but it didnapost take me long to realise I needed to get back to the hospital. Referred to the Birmingham and Midland Eye Centre, doctors prescribed higher strength eye drops that needed to be applied hourly - even at night. After weeks of sleepless nights and unable to work, Nick was left housebound and depressed, while doctors tried to decide the best course of action. He said: I love my job but I physically couldnapost be outside the house. The pain in my eye was too much and the only time I would leave was to visit the hospital. I felt at my absolute lowest and the one thing that would cheer me up - playing football - was no longer an option. Six months after his initial diagnosis, doctors decided the only option left was to perform a corneal cross linking. Usually used to treat keratoconus - an eye disorder causing thinning of the cornea - it involves using ultraviolet light and vitamin B drops to stfen the cornea. Employed together, the treatments bond fibres in the cornea more tightly.  While the procedure - performed in July last year - cleared the infection, Nick remained blind in his right eye. He said: Obviously, I didnapost want to be blind in my right eye but at least, knowing the infection had gone I could start to get my le back on track. I could finallyto work and start to hit the gym. But Nick still needed further treatment and in September , he had an amniotic membrane transplant to his right cornea at the Birmingham and West Midland Eye Centre. The procedure involves grafting tissue from the amniotic membrane - the innermost layer of the placenta - on to the eye to protect the cornea. It has anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring effects, as well as containing growth factors that promote wound healing on the surface of the eye. While the treatment was a success by Christmas , following the second operation, Nickaposs mood plummeted. He said: The reality of the situation had well and truly hit me, Iaposd let myself go since all of this happened and I was left with a gory-looking eye I had to cover with an eye patch - looking like something out of The Exorcist. After being referred to a counsellor by the GP, Nick has slowly come to terms with his condition. Working with the charity Fight for Sight to raise awareness about the danger of using contact lenses while showering or swimming has also helped. He said: I can honestly sayIaposd had the slightest idea that this was even a remote possibility I would never have worn contacts in the first place. Itaposs crucial that people out there know this is a reality and it can happen because of something as simple as getting in the shower. Now just six weeks away from a corneal transplant - an operation that replaces a damaged cornea with healthy donor tissue from someone who has died - Nick is counting down the days until the procedure on August  at Birmingham and Midland Eye Centre. He said: Iaposve lost  months of my le because of something as simple as showering with contacts in. If I get my sight back Iaposll never wear contacts again. Instead, like Edgar Davids - the former Dutch professional footballer - Iaposll wear some prescription goggles to do sport instead.

Weaposd never get so much as a glimpse of a christening photo again. But on this day in , the notorious Michael Fagan, painter and decorator, petty criminal and all round mischief maker from north east London, found himself inside Buckingham Palace, tip-toeing past doors signed aposCharlesapos and aposDianaapos, and sauntering among a two-week-old Prince Williamaposs baby pressies, including teddies and cups, laid out in all their tissue-papered glory. And that was just for starters.    Incredibly, so the story that never grows old, goes, he then famously walked straight into the Queenaposs bedroom, drew back the curtains of her four-poster, and was confronted by Liz herself...in a Liberty-print nightie down to her knees. You read the details today, and it feels made up. Maybe some of it has been embellished... But yes, this really, truly happened.    I was scareder than Iaposd ever been in my le, Fagan – perhaps Fagin might be more apt – said, years later. Then she speaks and itaposs like the finest glass you can imagine breaking: aposWawrt are you doing here !apos He described: It was a double bed but a single room, definitely – she was sleeping in there on her own. Her nightie was one of those Liberty prints and it was down to her knees. Reports at the time said the Queen had a long conversation with Fagan to stall him while security was summoned.  But he remembered it dferently. Nah!” he insisted. “She went past me and ran out of the room her little bare feet running across the floor. Astonishingly, this wasnapost even the first time he had broken in unperturbed.    A month earlier, he found himself in a bad way and at a loose end. His we, Christine, had just left him, and the thought came to him that it might be a way to have some fun. Casually, he climbed in over a ft barbed wire edged wall, and through the window of a shocked maidaposs bedroom – she, of course, ran straight to security. But when they found nobody in her room they thought sheaposd imagined it, and Fagan carried on for most of the night perusing the palace as whim. He found a bottle of “cheap Calornian wine” in Charlesapos room, reportedly, and drank it sitting, feet up, in front of her Majaposs priceless artworks. Then, desperate for the loo, he found himself in a fix.  “I couldnapost find a door which said aposWCapos. All I found were some bins with aposcorgi foodapos written on them,” he recalls. I was breaking my neck to go to the toilet. What do I do  Pee on the carpet  So I had to pee on the corgi food.” He recalls: It was harder to get out than get in. I eventually found a door and walked out into the back gardens, climbed over the wall and walked down the Mall, looking back and thinking aposoohapos. “I hadnapost thought about going in there until that last second when it came into my head to do it, so I was shocked. The second time however, he was caught – by Lizzie herself.   But from Faganaposs recollections the security response doesnapost seem too full on. Apparently, eventually, an unarmed footman showed up – and offered him a drink. The footman came and said, aposCor, f**king hell mate, you look like you need a drinkapos,” he recalled. “He took me to the Queenaposs pantry, across the landing, where I presume she cooks her baked beans and toast and whatever – and takes a bottle of Famous Grouse from the shelf and pours me a glass of whisky. With or without embellishments, itaposs a cracking tale – perhaps only disappointing in the seeming mundanity of palace le. It was very ordinary. I donapost think they spent too much on decoration. Maybe it was due a redec  Fagan described, adding it was dusty with squeaky floorboards. He said the Queenaposs bedroom was just “all right”. “It was quite plain, just the usual blankets and duvets. It was smaller than I thought it would be,” he shrugged.    The descriptions echo Mirror Reporter Ryan Parryaposs own findings in , when he managed to pose as a palace footman and was able to confirm the Royals did indeed enjoy cereal for breakfast stored in tupperware. One would hope – the Queen surely does – such an intrusion would never be allowed to happen again. But although not to such an intimate degree, perhaps,  intrusions are still pretty much a yearly event at Buck Palace. Last year, a homeless man who breached the perimeter at Buckingham Palace and went undetected for more than four hours prompted concerns over the security of the royal family. And the year beforehand, police also arrested a man who tried to climb over the wall.

Popular opinion suggests red wine should always be served at room temperature but wine experts argue certain ieties such as Pinot Noir are BETTER cold - particularly during the summer months. Thirty-six per cent of those polled will need some convincing however - as they think it’s ‘completely wrong’ to drink refrigerated red wine. Philip Sykes, principal of The British School of Etiquette, believes the research commissioned by Cono Sur Bicicleta shows it’s time to educate the public. He said: “Many people think that chilling red wine is a faux pas but this is definitely not the case, it just depends on the type of wine.    “Lighter reds such as a Pinot Noir you would usually chill to between  and  degrees. “In Mediterranean countries, it has long been customary to drink the lighter reds slightly chilled and we in the UK are moving in the same direction. “On a balmy summer’s day there is nothing better than placing a bottle of Pinot Noir in the fridge and enjoying a nice chilled glass of red wine. “It’s not only perfectly acceptable but will also bring out the flavours beautully.” The research of , wine drinkers found half prefer red wine above any other. But just eight per cent will pour a glass or two of red during the summer months – instead turning to white or rosé. Further to this, almost half have never tried red wine chilled and  per cent think doing so would be against wine etiquette. Although  per cent admit they find the do’s and don’ts surrounding the tipple to be confusing. In fact, just  per cent consider themselves to be ‘wine connoisseurs’.    So much so, half don’t bother with etiquette such as leaving wine to breathe before drinking it. The study carried out through OnePoll also revealed  per cent of those who have tried a chilled red found it refreshing. Master of Wine Alistair Cooper said: “Enjoying certain red wines chilled shouldn’t seem like a strange idea. “If you think of the fruit characters you often encounter with lighter, fruitier styles of red wines, like Pinot Noir - strawberries, raspberries and cherries. “They are all fruits that you’d enjoy on a summer’s day straight out of the fridge and the same goes for the wine. “Chilling the wine down really helps those fabulous fruit character to sing and shine.”*The label on Cono Sur Bicicleta Pinot Noir changes colour when the bottle has been chilled to the ideal temperature."},{"url":null,"title":"shop gives out very embarrassing","story":"NewsShop gives out very embarrassing plastic bags to shame customers who use themA supermarket has come up with a creative way to discourage their customers from using single-use plasticsShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  JUL NewsA supermarket is giving out rather embarrassing carrier bags \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email In a bid to crack down on plastic waste, one supermarket has started aposshamingapos their customers into bringing their own bags.

Sheri Grant, , from New South Wales, Australia, said she had always felt insecure about her body since she was a young girl. Ms Grant was naturally more petite than most of her friends due to her small frame, and was often told to eat more to gain weight. After giving birth to her first son, William in , the mother-of-three had a new found realisation and began to appreciate her body more.    Soon after, she gave birth to her two sons Casey, , and Kyle, .The mother launched an Instagram account @sherieheather, posting raw, unedited and unfiltered images of her postpartum body in a bid to inspire other mothers to embrace their imperfections.The pictures show Ms Grant posing with her young sons and pinching on her loose skin in a proud display showing her self-love and gratitude. She said: For a very long time growing up I disliked my body, as a little girl I never truly felt I fit in anywhere, I always felt like I had to be something I wasnapost andI didnapost I would be put down or ashamed of for not following the social expectations there were.    \u2028Being told to eat more, that I look sick, and who can forget getting called aposmosquito bitesapos - they are only a few remarks and comments I got growing up and I got them a lot, I had adults commenting on my body when I was  years old. \u2028Remember the saying sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me, well words do hurt and they hurt everyone, I just felt so lost in a messy world of hate. \u2028Becoming a mother has shown me great strengths and s my body has gone through to create three beautul children. Watching my body change dramatically showed me love and acceptance for my body.  Bearing my own children shone a bright light on the parts of me I didnapost want to look at or learn about, I had always felt trapped in my own skin until I had my third baby boy, Kye, I felt having him had helped unlock a part of me I never knew was there not to mention my amazing supportive partner who truly picks me up when Iaposm feeling really down. \u2028I started looking at every imperfection in a dferent way, I felt somewhat powerful I birthed into this new person, a person with more acceptance, love and appreciation. \u2028I wanted to be the woman I needed as a girl, I could not believe it took me to have children to truly love my body but it has. I really wanted to help people help the world and we need to start somewhere so then I started sharing my love to empower and inspire the women and people around me by sharing my le through Instagram.  I have always wanted to help people, seeing so many women not happy with their bodies especially new mums, it sparked a loving interest to share my real raw le with them and show them no one person or body is perfect but imperfectly beautul. As well as a lot of my friends saying I have been an inspiration to them.\u2028There are so many expectations in todayaposs society just like when I was a child and most of what we see isnapost real, either photoshopped, edited or medically enhanced, paid enhancements etc.We get shown the perfect images but not so much raw and I think it is mentally confusing for so many people to think they need to look like a certain expectation or body type.  I want people to know that they are beautul in and out no matter anyoneaposs opinions or thoughts on them, for far too long we have had one body type directed at us straight from magazines and people wanting to make money. We need more real le bodies showing our younger generations that their bodies are uniquely beautul no matter what society feeds them, hence why I am sharing my journey.

Svetlana Savchenkova, from Volgograd, southwest Russia, noticed the abnormal facial hair before she was pregnant but it worsened after she gave birth to her son, who is now seven years old. She had sought help from doctors but none of the medication improved her serious hirsutism condition - which stems from excess male hormones from an underlying endocrine imbalance. The -year-old claims doctors told her that there was nothing they could do and sheaposd aposhave to live with itapos.  Svetlana was so ashamed of her appearance that she would wear a face mask at home and stopped her son from touching her bearded face. She said: I canapost work or communicate with people normally, even my child. I donapost allow him to touch my face. Obviously, relations with my husband got much worse. He doesnapost kiss me now because it is disgusting. Every year it is getting worse. Iaposm afraid that our family will fall apart.  Encouraged by her husband, Svetlana bravely went on a TV medical show called aposIaposm Ashamed of My Bodyapos as a final bid to get rid of masculine-type hair which was making her le a misery. On the show, Svetlana was put under the care of a multi-disciplinary medical team and received laser therapy and treatment for polycystic oy sydrome. She was also put on sex steroids over the period of a year and followed advice on losing more than  lbs in weight. She claimed that the treatment has had a dramatic impact.  Svetlana said: I feel so happy now. I donapost need to wake up before the rest of my family to shave my face. Iaposm not afraid of losing my husband anymore because of my hairy face. I walk outdoors with my chin up after a dozen years of hiding my face. Gynaecologist Tatyana Rumyantseva who led the medical team treating her said: I’m so glad to see you without a mask.

From there I caught a ferry from Harwich to Rotterdam and made my way to Stuttgart via Den Bosch and Venlo, which are also in Holland, and on to Koblenz, Mainz and Mannheim in Germany before ending up in Stuttgart.“Once there, I saw round the Stuttgart factory and museum before coming home by train.”Arthur decided to undertake his gruelling journey for Harlow’s Helping Hand as a former colleague had been helped by the fund.He added: “Along the way people asked me why I was cycling such a distance so I told them about Harlow and they kindly donated money. Raising money for charity is one of the things my company does as a way of giving something back to the community.“This isn’t the first long distance bike ride I have completed.“I have previously cycled from Land’s End to John O’Groats with the money I raised going to a charity in Edinburgh named The Yard which raises cash for adventure playgrounds for disabled children.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1f2c032317a7.06468979-453x564.jpg ","title":"benjamin siegrist looking to make history as he aims for top flight place","story":"Benjamin Siegrist was flattered to be linked with a move to the English Championship over the summer.But other than to the Premiership with Dundee United, the Swiss goalkeeper isn’t planning of going anywhere for quite some time.Siegrist’s performances in the second half of last season, culminating in a string of five-star displays during the promotion play-offs, saw him watched by Nottingham Forest.That was nice to hear as he enjoyed a few weeks off last month but, as he focuses on the coming season with the Tangerines, fans will be delighted to learn it’s not turned his head.“It was nice but it just proved the point to me I know what I can do and I know where the standards lie,” he said.“I am more than happy here. I know what I have here and I work well with the staff.“I know how big a club this is and I am really happy to be here.“And what is important for me is I want to be one of those players who go in the history books of this club and say he was one who got promotion for the team.“I want to improve and learn every week. As a team I think we got better last season as the games continued and I think I got better as a goalkeeper.“We want to keep doing that this year and,we do, we will get back to where we want to be.“Everybody knows where this club belongs and everybody wants to be part of achieving that ultimate goal of getting promoted.“That’s a big point of incentive and motivation for all the players.”Siegrist admits a bonus for him as he ed to work last week was teaming up again in training with fellow-goalie Deniz Mehmet.He was at United until January and has ed with a view to signing up again.“We crossed paths before when we were younger, at international tournaments with Switzerland and Turkey.“Coming from clubs down south we also faced each other. We are competing for the same place but there is always the goalkeepers’ union that means we stick together and it is nice to be working every day with someone you like.”Very much one for looking forward, Siegrist refuses to dwell too long on the disappointing end to last term that saw United again miss out on promotion in the play-offs.And when he does look back, he takes the positives.“I think what happened last year is part of our motivation for this year but I don’t want to speak too much about it because we start from zero again for a new season.“You do every year. In terms of experience it is good that we have had big games, big occasions together and that will help us.“It is like money in the bank but this season is about doing it consistently and picking up points over the whole of the year.”Tonight sees the start of a busy weekend when the entire squad will be involved in a friendly at Brechin before heading for Dumbarton tomorrow to do it all again.Two games in less than  hours may seem unusual but, for Siegrist, it will be the perfect way to prepare for the start of the competitive action in the Betfred Cup at Hearts next week.“So far as fitness goes we are good and game time is the most valuable time you have as a player,” he added.“You can train all week butyou don’t have a game at the end of it you are not bringing everything you’ve worked on together.“It is good to have as many games as we can so we are looking forward to these two games.“There is a lot more to football than passing and running, so game time is the most valuable part of pre-season.”"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-how-many-of-these-old-photos-of-glasgow-do-you-remember","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-angus-woman-zoe-archibald-gets-stuck-in-toy-car","story":"THIS is the hilarious moment a Scotswoman got stuck in a childrens toy car -

I am ready to go.”Dons boss Derek McInnes aims to sign a midfielder before tomorrow’s pm deadline to register a “wildcard” for the Europa League first qualying round.Rather than be concerned about the addition of another, more experienced player, in his position Campbell is relishing the challenge.With another midfield arriving imminently, Campbell accepts the onus is on him to force his way into McInnes’s plans – and stay there.He said: “I look forward to new players coming in to test myself against seasoned pros.“I feel like this is a big year for myself.“Last season, I had a taste of what It takes to become a first team regular.“There is a lack of central midfielders at the moment, so it is down to me to earn my place in the squad and that is certainly what I look to do. It is completely down to me, as the manager will play who he feels is the best for that position.“It is down to me to work hard and improve my game as much as I can to be ready to play in that spot and take those opportunities when they come.”Being pitched into major games has never fazed the Aberdonian, who has a proven track record of rising to the big occasion.McInnes showed faith in the teenager by making him the youngest player to feature for Aberdeen, making his debut in the - season at  years and  days old.Campbell was also thrown on with  minutes left against Celtic at Parkhead in the final game of the - season. It was a must-win gamethe Dons were to beat Rangers to runners-up spot and finish second for a fourth successive season and Campbell played a ket role in a - victory.Last season, his first start for the Dons came in the Scottish Cup quarter final replay against Rangers at Ibrox.Again he showed maturity and composure way beyond his years as he excelled in a - victory.He said: “I feel there is no pressure when I am on the ball and playing, even when it is the biggest stages. I just relish it and enjoy playing for the team I love.“I don’t feel like there is too much pressure on myself.“I know what I can do on the ball and I feel that any game I go into I can control a game of football.”McInnes has shown he is not adverse to pitching teenagers into the heart of midfield for European debuts.Last season, he handed teenager Ferguson his first team debut in the Europa League first leg against Premier League Burnley at Pittodrie.Ferguson got the nod to start ahead of experienced summer signings Gleeson and Chris Forrester.The catalyst for a magnicent season, Ferguson scored a memorable over-head kick in the -loss to Burnley at Turf Moor.He went on to start every game he was available for. Having been on the bench against Burnley, Campbell wants Euro game time and aims to see off RoPS in the hope it can be the first step of a Euro adventure that could land a big team.Campbell said: “I was on the bench last year against Burnley, which was a fantastic tie in terms of the name, the team we played and the way we performed.“It was a brilliant experience to see the Premier League players at that level and we coped more than fine. So, hopefully, we can make a run at it and play bigger teams along the line.”Aberdeen concluded their pre-season preparations with a - draw with Inverness Caley Thistle.As was the case in the previous two friendlies against Connah’s Quay Nomadsand Peterhead , Campbell anchored the midfield with fellow teen Ferguson.He said: “The game against Inverness was a tough match.“It was probably the toughest test we have had going into the Europa League game.“I felt that we had control of the game for the first  to  minutes.“Then, for the last  minutes, it became a bit more even.“Inverness got an equaliser from a set-piece, at which we were disappointed.“Now the Europa League starts on Thursday and that is our focus.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/5d1f879f965d92.07437323.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet monty charlie and jemma marlee are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Little Monty is still a youngster at just  months old, and is full of mischief and can be a little feisty at times.She has been around children previously, but will need to be supervised with youngsters as sometimes that feisty side can come from nowhere.She is not suitable to be homed with other cats or dogs.Monty is desperate to get out and about to explore, so a new home with access outdoors is a must.This cheeky chap is a happy little boy who is full of beans.Charlie, who is eight, will bark at other dogs that he meets and there is no history on him mixing with other dogs.He is not used to cats, but has been around children aged over eight.Charlie has a grade  heart murmur – this is not causing him any problems at present, but it will need to be monitored in the future.Could Charlie be the pal for you This beautul pair are looking for a home to share together as they do love each other’s company.Marlee, who is an eight-year-old, long-haired tabby, is an attention-seeker and is always the first to come and see you.Jemma, a two-year-old tortoiseshell, is more reserved and waits for you to come to her but when you do she wants you to make a fuss of her all day.Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"the easy club is taking the show on the road","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Easy Club is taking to the streets of Mid Argyll this summer to spread its musical message of ersity and inclusion –  although they will have a Plan B in place should the weather disagree.Club members will play by the Baptist Church, Lochgilphead, from pm to pm on Saturday June , then Ardrishaig by the Kelpies in Pier Square, from pm to pm on Saturday July .The club will also hit the Stag Hotel in Lochgilphead, either just before or just after early one evening.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in

planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us!

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child. I know some children from P in St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who know the answer to this."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-turn-prestonpans-town-hall-into-a-digital-paradise","story":"Prestonpans Community Council is bidding to take control of the High Street venue and turn it into an audio-visual and digital haven.A sub-committee of the community council that was formed when the option for a Community Asset Transferof the Town Hall to the group was first offered has come up with a lsquodigital destinationrsquo concept ndash and garnered positive feedback from the community council.The community council is the only group to have put in a note of interest for the Town Hall, and the sub-committee ndash featuring DJ Johnston Smith, Calum Miller and Professor Roger Bromley ndash has now made public its vision for the building.Their initial idea is to create an audio-visual centre within the Town Hall for gamers and competitions, as well as running educational classes on technology and creating a ldquodigital destination for all with k audio-visual displays, fibreoptic network, high-speed computers, floor space and a cafe.In the subcommittee strategy, the members state: ldquoThe activities which once occupied our Town Hall are not filling it today we need to think creatively to identy new audiences.ldquoAll of the traditional activities can now be accommodated where in our town.ldquoOur Town Hall needs to offer something unique to the community: our challenge is to use our assets to create richer social interactions for all.ldquoWe live in a world where the social networks that helped us advance are increasingly replaced by the digital iety.

Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

Now its never. A flat no. Forget it. Youll have had your referendum.Both Boris and Hunt made clear at the Perth Hustings that there will be no independence referendum, eventhe SNP win outright in . Thats a sobering message for the independence movement, and for Nicola Sturgeon. She still regards the Section  route to a legally-binding referendum as the only plausible one. That is now road-blocked.There has been a dramatic hardening of rhetoric against Scotland during this campaign. Theresa May came to Stirling to proclaim that Nicola Sturgeon ldquocannot be trusted. That the Scottish government is incapable of negotiating ldquoin good faith. Why, Sturgeon had the temerity to portray the UK governments takeover of powers repatriated from Brussels as a ldquopower grab. You just cant deal with these people, May concluded.We all know what Boris Johnson thinks about Scotland. A nation of ldquofreeloaders. He described Scotland having free care and free tuition as ldquopretty monstrous. Jeremy Hunt has tended to be more emollient, but on Friday his gloves came off too. He condemned the Scottish Government as: ldquothe most bullying, isive, duplicitous, anti-business government Scotland has ever seen.Given that the Scottish National Party dominates the opinion polls, and has more seats in both parliaments than all the Unionist parties put together, this could be taken as an oblique criticism of the Scottish voter. I mean, are Scots so stupid that they dont realise they are being run by bullying charlatans  Its almost asthey cant be trusted to know their best interests, deluded as they are by the hypnotic rhetoric of separatism.This was all rather redolent of how British imperialists, like Churchill, used to talk about nationalist leaders in the old British colonies. They were all wily demagogues, up to no good. Cant trust them as far as you can throw them. The subtext was: the only language they understand is firmness. Just tell them what the score is and let them get on with it.This is very much the line taken in the Dailylast week by the Thatcherite former Scottish Secretary, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. He says that the real threat to the Union comes from ldquogiving in to Nationalists demands. The Tories best bet is to tell them politely but firmly that they can stick their independence up their Great Glen ndash or words to that effect.All this is, of course, exactly what the SNP want to hear. There is nothing better for drumming up support for the Nationalist cause than hearing a phalanx of crusty Tory grandees telling Scotland to like the Union or lump it. Support for independence is creeping up ndash slowly but steadily ndash and is now % in the latest polls, and %Boris Johnson wins.True, demand for an early referendum on Scottish independence is certainly muted. But after Mr Johnson enters Number Ten ndash a racing certainty according to the latest YouGov poll ndash and a no deal Brexit looms, things could move fast. The SNP expect support for Yes, which has been stuck for five years, to jump dramatically. Possibly approaching that % which Nicola Sturgeon allowed the media to speculate back in  was the threshold for calling a repeat referendum.But its going to be messy. There is already disquiet in the party and in the wider Yes movement at the SNP leaders apparent lack of enthusiasm for leading the independence revolution. But after this Tory leadership campaign, she can be in no doubt that there has been a sea-change in attitudes to Scotland from the governing party. No more Mr Nice Guy. Scots will have to learn to love Brexit Britain or take the high road out of the Union.Yet, its a little odd that Scotland should have become such a touchstone issue in the Tory leadership race. There are hardly any Tory members in Scotland, after all, and it is they wholl be doing the voting in the campaign, which is now reaching peak empty promise as the ballot papers go out. But both contenders seem to have chosen to make the Union and Scotlands place in it central to their respective campaigns.They each claim, rather improbably, to have an almost religious attachment to the Union. Its blood-in-my-veins stuff for Hunt. The ldquomost successful Union in history according to Boris Johnson, clearly believing that the United States somehow fails to qualy as a union.Perhaps this relates to something deep in the Conservative psyche: that Great Britain needs to retain its subject nationalities to prove that it is still a going concern. Certainly, the loss of Scotland - taking with it a third of the UK landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all of its nuclear weapons - would be a devastating blow to Brexit Britain. The UKs prestige, already diminished as a result of the three years of chaos and indecision, would take an even greater knock. It could lose its place on the UN Security Council, become an empty chair at G Summits...So, there was a bit of carrot to go along with the stick. Boris Johnson has declared himself ldquoMinister for the Union with the implication that devolution is now as important to the Prime Ministers role as First Lord of the Treasury . He is going to take Scotland well in hand, and ensure that all policies in future are stress tested for compatibility with all four nations.Jeremy Hunt too came bearing gts. Scotland is to become a ldquogreen Silicon Valley, a post-Brexit digital entrepocirct. He presumably avoided saying ldquoSilicon Glen because that would have reminded Scottish voters of what happened the last time Scotlands future was predicated on new technology, back in the days when the Tory George Younger ran the Scottish Office.At its height, in the early s, Scotlands technology industry made one third of all the computers manufactured in Europe. Not any more. They went where as the UK de-industrialised under Margaret Thatcher. Mr Hunt also hyped his proposal to slash corporation tax to .% - something Alex Salmond used to argue for. However, this is a policy for the UK as a whole, not Scotland, so there is no obvious comparative advantage, still less any promised to devolve business taxes.But the headline message from both Tory candidates in the Perth hustings was withering contempt for the independence movement. This will no doubt please Conservative members in the southern shires, who have already largely given up on Scotland and regard the Union with pointed indference. As YouGov discovered recently, the vast majority would willingly let Scotland goit meant saving Brexit.They may get their way sooner than they think."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-skiffies-invention-leads-record-world-championships-numbers","story":"The skfie was created in  by Fe kit boat manufacturer, Alec Jordan after winning the backing of the Scottish Fisheries Museum in Anstruther and the internationally renowned designer Iain Oughtred, based on Skye, who was asked to come help with a plan for cheap ft boats that could be raced.Inspired by the traditional Fair Isle skf, their beauty was they came as flat pack kits to be built in community huts, initially cut from sheets of plywood, and initially sold for less than pound.While Mr Jordan initially was only expecting to sell a few dozen kits over \"a few long years\", he was amazed to find that the invention has taken off.Great day at the  SkfieWorlds Championships in Stranraer with a record  community crews from  clubs competing from across Scotland and even from Tasmania and Netherlands @StranraerSkf pic wuqyJITLwIn ten years it is estimated Scottish communities have built , there are  in England,  in the US,  in Australia and  in New Zealand.

Though there is no doubt that Brexit has witnessed the most acute constitutional crisis in modern times, Mr Shafis frustrated call for Ms Sturgeon and the Scottish Government to ldquoface down the British state risks the abandonment of democratic practices which would utterly discredit Scotland on the international stage. His article is a clarion call for civil disorder and, as a former member of the Socialist Workers Party, clearly, but erroneously, based on Marxist ideals.Independence must be achieved, in the immediate or long-term future, within the parameters of what is democratically possible in Britain. A Boris Johnson premiership may well be completely repugnant to many Scots but that does not mean they will take to the streets and man the barricades until autonomy is granted. The Catalonian movement for independence has suffered a severe setback precisely by adopting the tactics suggested here by Mr Shafi.There is no better leader in Britain at present than Nicola Sturgeon. She remains committed to a civic nationalism, based on social democratic principles. Ms Sturgeon knows that some in the independence movement are becoming impatient and vocal, yet she steadfastly maintains that her stoical approach to independence is the correct one, protecting Scotlands interests whenever she can and promoting Scotland on the international stage, regardless of funding or support from Westminster.A gradualist outlook remains within the gt of the current Scottish Government. There is still a likelihood that a General Election can happen this year in the event of Brexit claiming more political casualties. The chances of the SNP becoming power brokers in a future British government are greater than they have been for a generation. Mr Shafi may learn that playing by Westminsters rules may not entirely be to the disadvantage of those who crave an independent Scottish state.Owen Kelly, Stirling.WHAT more is to be said about Brexit, a curse visited upon this land by the Conservative Party  A curse which has moreover paralysed the leadership of the official Opposition.But no one as appalled as I am at the prospect of the disaster about to befall us can stay silent. I can think of one counter-force which will drive the undesirable values personied by Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and sundry others back over the Border, that force being independence: an independence forced upon the citizens of Scotland by the imposition of the aforementioned values which have overtaken the UKrsquos democracy and seriously damaged its political systems. I say this despite not being a nationalist, such being one who believes independence is a desirable end in itself, no matter the consequences.And so an argument for independence must be qualied by the honest and realistic use of the phrase ldquofor better or for worse, backed up by a commitment to protect the poor, the disabled and otherwise marginalised from the inevitable financial turbulence which a newly independent Scotland would inevitably have to weather. Nevertheless nothing, surely, can be worse than the forces on the point of being leashed upon us by the current manestation of hard-right English nationalism.However perhaps a rabbit can yet be pulled out of the hat and the UK saved from Brexit. So, in the meantime, I shall march in hope against the twin anathemas which are a xenophobic Faragism and the determination of the hardcore neo-Thatcherites who see in Brexit an opportunity to destroy and Americanise the Welfare State.John Milne, Uddingston.AT the Perth hustings, Scottish Conservatives were told by their leadership candidates that the Union comes before Brexit. Personally, I am sceptical about this, but I am sure Scottish Conservatives will be reassuredBoris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt were to restate that stance at a major hustings in England, preferably in the glare of the press and television cameras.I dare them.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.BEFORE the SNP gives any further thought of trying to break up the UK perhaps it should give some regard to where goods and services exported from Scotland actually go. The main volume, amounting to more than pound billion in value, goes to England, and other parts of the UK. It does seem inappropriate to have any wish to fall out with those who are your best customers.Nicola Sturgeon would certainly appear very keen for an independent Scotland to become a member of the EU, yet Scotlands exports to Europe amount to only about poundbn. And could an independent Scotland actually afford the exorbitant fees to be a member of that grandiose club or in effect have any real say in its policies or agreements Scotlands export trade to the rest of the world for goods and services amounts to slightly over poundbn, much of which trade is currently negotiated through departments of the UK Government.But then, of course, Nicola Sturgeon has always been inclined to gripe about almost anything British.The SNP administration may well believe that one major source of income for an independent Scotland would be the whisky industry. The key player in this sector is obviously Diageo plc, with  distilleries, worldwide sales, but alas its registered office is in London. The distilleries belonging to this and other groups may be located in Scotland but in many cases these could be described as merely \"hollowed out\" contractors, with the financial controls located in other parts of the world. Along with many well-known brands has gone the ownership of their established whisky businesses. The corporation tax trail for any future Scottish exchequer could be fraught with dficulties.I believe that the only realistic solution is to carry on with the status quo, expand the UKs export trade, and faze out Nicola Sturgeon and her SNP cronies.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmEmergency services were on standby at Kirkwall Airport this morning after a Loganair plane turned back after suffering from engine problems.

This will disrupt flights at the busiest time of the year.“It is the ongoing work to rule, however, that is causing most problems for travellers. The disruption is unpredictable and dficult to avoid. Last week, for example, the refusal to agree an extension to the opening hours at Kirkwall airport saw passengers stranded in Aberdeen, including patients and a mother ing with her new-born baby.“It underlines the impact this industrial action is having and who is paying the price.

It is disheartening to have received a counter-offer from Prospect that is beyond our affordability.“Over the past eight months, we have discussed ious options with the union and have been clear throughout that any proposal must be affordable and within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. Prospect are aware of HIAL’s budgetary restrictions and our latest offer constituted compromise to accommodate trade union demands within the bounds of the pay policy.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute and our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five-year period remains on the table. The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our communities and the airlines operating from our airports.

A week does not seem to pass without someone appealing for a gentler, kinder style of politics. Well,my own experience this week is anything to go by it will be a long time coming. Indeed it is probably a forlorn hope. I am just back from attending the first meeting of the ninth session of the European Parliament held in Strasbourg. It was an eventful experience and one that, unlike my colleagues, I am able to contrast and compare against the eight years I served in the Scottish Parliament. While the parliaments are dferent in a iety of waysthere was enough in my first week to give me a taste of what to expect. Sadly I can testy the nature of political discourse has deteriorated signicantly. Thus far it is not the behaviour of the parliamentarians that is especially dferent, but the relationship between politicians and the public that has changed. Politicians the world over and from all political colours can be pompous, ignorant, isive and rude – and courteous, inspiring, witty and magnanimous – or a combination of both – but that has always been the case. What I found this week was that in my  years away from professional politics as an elected servant of the people, the mood of the public appears to have changed dramatically for the worse.• : Outrage after new MEP Anne Widdecombe compares Brexit to emancipation of slavesIn my past le as a Tory MSP, I witnessed all sorts of stunts by opponents and colleagues, and took part intentionally or inadvertently in a few myself, but I cannot recall anything other than a handful of letters of complaint, never mind abusive language, in that time. Now there is an instant reaction that, courtesy of the internet, reaches elected members in a wide iety of forms – from text messages, emails,tweets and presumably Facebook posts . Some of it is vile, and the quantity surprised even an old dog like me.One particular example was the opening of the European Parliament itself, where the -plus members were told to stand for its “national anthem” before proceedings officially began. The Brexit Party MEPs had been sitting down at that point but had agreed amongst ourselves thatasked to stand we would do so with our backs to the dais.For us it was a quiet and dignied way of showing our rejection of the idea of a European superstate with its own flag, embassies, diplomatic corps, army – and an anthem that had already been rejected by prime minister TonyBlair and in referendums on the proposed EU constitution by the French and Dutch.As a statement, it did not require brightly coloured T-shirts with offensive slogans rejecting the UK’s democratic choice, or placards for MEPs to hold up in chamber– or causing a commotion or storming out in protest. It was just a silent rejection of an example of empire-building that has caused Europeans of all nations, but especially the British, to say we’ve had enough. After this short moment we then turned, sat down and participated in the remaining proceedings.Within minutes the messages were pinging into our phones, the emails were arriving and the media, receiving and witnessing the same, only wanted to talk about that one “disrespectful” event. For all but a few exceptions the Liberal Democrats’ “Bollocks to Brexit” t-shirts were ignored unless we made a point of asking why. • : MPs step up plans to block no-deal Brexit amid leadership contestEmails calling me a iety of epithets that would peel the nish of my mother’s front door soon reached my inbox. A suspicious swarm of similarly worded emails then flew in – berating me in emotional terms that would make those of a gentler disposition wish to seek solitude in a dark room.Former BBC politics journalist Gavin Esler tweeted we “shamelessly copied” the Nazi Party in s Germany who turned their backs on a Jewish speaker in the Reichstag – insinuating we share some political DNA them. This was somewhat ironic given the anthem, Beethoven’s Ode to Joy was one of Hitler’s favourites and played to him on his birthday. More importantly Esler’s reaction completely ignored the lineage that turning one’s back is a form of political protest and signalled the double standards of so many of those criticising it on this occasion.As City lawyer Alex Deane pointed out, British POWs turned their backs on Japan’s Emperor Akihito in  as he passed down the Mall with Her Majesty the Queen. In  and  members of the public – co-ordinated by campaign groups including Hope Not Hate and Prayers for Peace – turned their backs on English Democratic League rallies held in Bradford city centre. In  some members of the public turned their backs on the funeral cortege of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher as it passed on its way to St Paul’s Cathedral. Likewise, later that same year hundreds of NYPD officers turned their backs on a speech by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio at a funeral of two officers killed on duty. More recently women turned their backs on Canadian premier Justin Trudeau protesting against his “fake feminism” and the same protest has been used against President Trump. Were those people borrowing their form of protest from the Nazis, did those protests receive condemnation from our liberal intelligentsia or be ridiculed by BBC staff, past and present, as my colleagues and I were  As the week moved on so did the media attention – but not the faux-outrage of social media victims. Quite correctly the media wanted to know what we thought of the EU’s backroom dealing to agree the candidates for ious positions including the parliament’s own president, president of the European Commission, the president of the Council of Ministers and president of the European Central Bank. While we pointed to the democratic shortcomings of that process, that is just one symptom of the EUs centralised and secretive government, the communications parading the personal upset over our back-turning just kept coming – without any reference to the EU elite’s disrespect to their own people.A gentler, kinder style of politics  If it ever existed I don’t think it’s ing soon. Social media’s anonymity has undoubtedly allowed greater guerrilla tactics and binary referenda have ided the country like never before. Politics has toto meat and two veg issues again.

Last week, one law firm successfully obtained interim orders from Glasgow Sherf court to temporarily stop the eviction of five asylum seekers.: Hundreds of asylum seekers face new threat of eviction in GlasgowFurther interim interdicts preventing a lock change on behalf of some iniduals were granted today. It is believed there will be further court actions taken in the following weeks.Serco revealed in June it would change the locks on around  homes in the city as its contract with the UK Government to provide free accommodation to those claiming asylum comes to an end later this year.The corporate giant first announced the programme of works last summer but it was delayed after it faced a backlash from politicians and charities as well as a legal challenge from two asylum seekers.Serco said it was informed in January by the Home Office that it had been unsuccessful in its bid to supply accommodation for asylum seekers in Scoltand from  onwards.Fiona McPhail, principal solicitor at Shelter Scotland, said: “Scotland has a proud tradition of protecting the rights of tenants and occupiers. “It’s widely accepted by our courts that eviction is the most severe form of interference with the right to respect for the home and that where public authorities intend to evict someone they must do so lawfully. For these reasons, we recognise the importance of involving the courts, sherf officers and other safeguards which reduce the risk of people being unnecessarily thrown out onto the streets. “We are convinced that lock-change evictions due to be carried out by Serco are illegal and should not be going ahead.“We will continue to fight for the housing rights of all people, including asylum seekers. We call upon Serco to halt lock change evictions until the law is claried in ongoing litigation.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon got it wrong over citizens assembly announcement","story":"Nicola Sturgeon made a \"mistake\" over the way she announced plans for a new Citizens Assembly to look into Scotlands future, according to the new chair of the body.Former Labour MEP David Martin said it should not have been announced as part of a \"three course of action\" package in Parliament by the First Minister.

Unlike most places, in Edinburgh the main shopping street only had buildings on one side.In  the Princes Street Panel was formed to address the issue. Three leading architects spent  years scratching their heads and came up with the most radical plan imaginable. They proposed demolishing every Victorian building and replacing them with a row \u2028of brutalist modern structures with an elevated upper floor providing extra retail space.The old ornate Boots building was the first to go and be replaced by the drab modern premises of today and after a couple of other demolitions the plan was halted and the street has remained largely as we see it today. But for how much longer Princes Street now faces the biggest challenge in the  years since those demolition days. You don’t have to be a retail genius to see the problem. Rising rents and rates have coincided with the growth of online retail. Many shoppers now prefer clicks to bricks and that switch is obvious from the state of Princes Street today. The city can fight to keep retail on Princes Street, but that probably means a battle to the bottom. But there is a glimmer of hope for Scotland’s best-known street and it comes in the shape of the forthcoming £m Johnnie Walker Whisky Experience in the old House of Fraser building at the West End.Without it, Princes Street may well have been doomed, but with it comes a possible fresh start. The grandeur of the magnicent south-facing vista from Princes Street suggests an alternative future. With a fresh, more flexible approach to planning ...

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims.

Herbinson had survived the slaughter of the first day on the Somme where he had performed gallantly under fire and subsequently moved with the remainder of the thDivision to the British sector in Belgium. The th RIR Association were on their annual pilgrimage to the WW battlefields, taking part in the July  ceremonies on the Somme before visiting other sites. Editor’s note: Robert Herbinson was born at Clonavon, Ballymena and is buried at Ration Farm Cemetery Annexe, Ploegsteert, Belgium and commemorated in Wellington Street Presbyterian Church. Ballymena Observer, September ,  - Miss Herbinson,  Hill Street, Ballymena, has been informed that her brother, Sergeant R. Herbison th Royal Irish Rleswas killed in action on Sunday, August th. Sergeant Herbinson was, prior to joining the colours, an employee in the Phoenix Weaving Factory, Ballymena.He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and of Ballykeel LOL . His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"limited sharing of brexit information shows uk total indifference to northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was only released to the broadcaster on an appeal to the Information Commissioner. It was initially withheld, officials said because it was felt disclosure would \"weaken or inhibit\" their negotiating position and given Brexit was still \"live issue\" it needed to be considered internally \"freely and frankly\".The Brexit Gateway Review was compiled by experts in the Department of Finance and assessed the Brexit preparations carried out by the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development- a key department in terms of cross-border trading in agriculture.It recommended a need for \"clear tactical and operational focus\" to prepare for the UKs departure from the EU from day one as well as a need to identy potential gaps that needed to be addressed. It suggested communication between the department in Northern Ireland and officials in London was not adequate. \"Northern Ireland officials have limited visibility of Brexit information even in areas that are critical to Northern Ireland interests,\" the review said.It went on to say as the original March Brexit deadline approached communication improved.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said the revelations showed \"the total lack of concern in London regarding the impact on people here\".“Despite the fact that the north will be hardest hit by this disastrous policy, we continue to see London’s total indference and disregard for the consequences of Brexit in Ireland.“We are being driven toward a disastrous no deal Brexit. In that eventuality the British Government needs to act in line with the Good Friday Agreement and announce a referendum to give people the option of remaining in the EU through Irish reunication.”A DAERA spokesman said it had an \"excellent working relationship\" with its colleagues in London."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38291208.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/speed.jpg","title":"112 motorists caught speeding every day in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Speeding kills speeding drivers shouldnt be on the road.\"SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly, a member of the Policing Board, said: \"There is a massive problem with speeding in Northern Ireland, particularly on rural roads. \"Almost all fatalities or serious injuries in car crashes today are down to human error. \"Speeding enforcement is poor, education about speeding is poor and there should be severe punishments handed out to repeat offenders.\"A spokesperson for road safety charity Brake said: \"Selfish, speeding drivers put not only themselves, but all other road users, at serious risk, and it is concerning to see an increase in the number of drivers caught speeding in Northern Ireland.\" There were  injury collisions recorded at safety camera sites in  -  of these were accidents that led to fatal or serious injury.The PSNI said excessive speed is consistently one of the principal causes of most serious road traffic collisions.Chief Inspector Diane Pennington said: \"Tragically,  people have already lost their lives on our roads this year. Everyone should stop and think about this figure for a moment. \"Every time you hear about a fatal or serious collision on the news, there is a family, a circle of friends, a community plunged into mourning. \"There are many other people across the country who are having to learn how to cope with le-changing injuries after being involved in serious collisions.\"This is why it is critically important to remind all drivers that there are consequences to breaking the speed limit and driving in a manner that does not consider the safety of all road users. \"Police will continue to enforce the law and are determined to make Northern Irelands roads safer.\"If everyone slowed down, did not drive after drinking or taking drugs, wore a seatbelt and drove with greater care and attention then together we can save lives on our roads.\""},{"url":null,"title":"irish government urged to prepare for border poll","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

prepared to have one, and this could happen very, very quicklyMary Lou McDonaldSpeaking on RTE’s Sean O’Rourke show, Ms McDonald said: “At this juncture, the Government is correct to put renewed focus on the possibility of a disorderly crash.“We need to prepare diplomatically and politically.“If Britain chooses by accident to crash out of the EU in a disorderly fashion then that decision cannot mean we take big steps backwards.”She added that in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU, public opinion has “made clear” they wish to see the issue of the border addressed.“I believe we can best prepare ourselves by doing that in a thoughtful, methodical and prepared way,” the Sinn Fein president added.“This is why preparation is of the essence becausethat is to happen, the Irish Government needs to be in a state of preparedness and I think that the time is now for the Government to create that space, that context, that framework for an all-island inclusive conversation on Ireland post-Brexit and on the issue of the border.“I am talking about a referendum as and when we are prepared to have one and this could happen very, very quickly.“It’s like any of the great seismic political changes that have happened in modern times – when they happen, they happen very quickly.“It can be in a matter of weeks, in some cases days.”In reference to the party’s long-standing abstentionist policy in Westminster, Ms McDonald said: “It is not within the gt of Sinn Fein to stop Brexit.”Fianna Fail’s Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said Sinn Fein’s position on Brexit has been “tempered” and accused the party of using it to advance its political agenda of a border poll.“She said we must be preparing now and I think that is utterly reckless,” Ms Chambers added.“Talking about a border poll when Brexit is just  days away only further destabilises the situation we already have, and certainlywe have a Brexit crash, the last thing our Government should be doing is preparing for a border poll.“It needs to help our small to medium enterprises, our hauliers, because a lot of businesses will be looking to Government for signicant support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"new ira may use brexit to recruit more members says psni chief","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

We would be taking a step into the unknown.\"He added: \"Its not in the UKs interest to have no-deal, its not in the EUs interest to have a no-deal.

One of them is country, one of the others is LGBTI rights,\" she said at the time.“I asked for a categoric assurance thatany deal or scoping deal was done with the DUP there would be absolutely no rescission of LGBTI rights in the rest of the UK, in Great Britain, and that we would use any influence that we had to advance LGBTI rights in Northern Ireland“Its an issue very close to my heart and one that I wanted categoric assurances from the prime minister on, and I received .”Now it has emerged that, via an FOI request by Channel  news, just £ has been spent by the Government on advancing LGBT rights - on rainbow lanyards.Kathleen Bradley, a close friend of Lyra McKee and her partner Sara, said the sum made her feel “worthless” and urged Ms Davidson to intervene.“With Ruth being in the position she is.. and being herself from the community, I would really urge Ruth to go back to the Prime Minister.. and to say, look, this isn’t something that can be ignored,” she told Channel .Sinead Quinn, another friend of Lyra’s, said she hoped marriage equality in Northern Ireland would form part of Lyra’s legacy.She said: “The people in Northern Ireland – % you’re talking who would welcome marriage equality.\"We need to get as many of the % to take to the streets to write letters to do whatever they can within their capabilities to ensure that marriage equality comes. And it would be lovely to have that as part of Lyra’s legacy.”Ruth Davidson said the £ figure was \"not fair\" and she would go back Theresa May to continue to lobby the issue. data-dfpadtargeting\"\"

Some say with beef farming being blamed for climate change, it’s hypocritical to transport beef from across the world with four times the climate footprint. pic LkKzyRnMC— aoe-grace moore.July , The deal could see an extra , tonnes of beef, , tonnes of poultry and  tonnes of pork imported from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, a development that Irish farmers say could decimate the industry.The Irish farming lobby argue that the beef produced in Ireland is of the highest standard, and the import of south American meat will introduce unfair competition with producers who do not abide by similar standards, due to far less demanding health, traceability and environmental requirements.Shane Galvin from Limerick, who has worked on his family beef farm since the age of four, says the trip to Dublin was vital to drive home the message that the deal must be stopped.“We have to make them understand how important this is to rural Ireland,” he said.“The EU are trying to flex their muscles againstTrump in case of any kind of trade war, but it’s a reckless deal when you compare it with the fact that we don’t know what will happen with Brexit.“Three hundred thousand tonnes of Irish beef goes to the UK,it’s a hard Brexit – where is that beef going to go Along with the livestock sectors in France @Interbev_fr. Spain @asoprovac, Italy @ASSOCARNI  Poland, we are opposing the #Mercosur trade deal. Here is our joint statement 👉https:t.co gaDbNPhfg pic iEQgEAA— Irish Farmers AssocJuly , “Now they’re talking about bringing in more cheap beef and poultry, it’ll all have a massive knock- on effect.“Outside of this,it’s a hard Brexit, the number of beef farmers will have to halve or quarter.“When the cheaper meat comes in, it’ll drive the price of Irish meat down, we’re already in a loss making situation.“In the west coast, beef farming is the only viable farming,they go, the place goes wild, farms aren’t tended, tourism is affected because no one wants to look at that, and it all spirals from there.”Another key issue for the IFA is the environmental impact.Beef farming has come under sustained criticism as governments across Europe tackle their own environmental targets, over concern about the impact it has on climate change.The EU Commission Joint Research Centre found that Irish beef is four times more carbon efficient than Brazilian meat, a fact that the IFA says highlights the hypocrisy of the deal.The Government cannot allow this deal to pass @IFAmedia tells elected reps....#Mercosur pic cwWpCclm— Irish Farmers AssocJuly , Supporters of the deal argue that rather than undermining sustainability, the deal presents an opportunity for Europe to export high social and environmental standards to the South American bloc.EU agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan said last week that critics are exploiting environmental concerns to block free trade.Speaking after the deal announcement, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Michael Creed conceded that he was very concerned at the potential impact of some elements.“I am very disappointed that this agreement includes a signicant tarf rate quota for South American beef, at a time when the beef sector in Europe is facing signicant uncertainty because of Brexit,” he said.“I am deeply concerned at the potential impact on the Irish beef sector.”Despite the Commission’s agreement, Joe Healy from the IFA said the ball was not yet over the line.“We want to put the pressure on politicians here to exert that pressure on MEPs and pressure further down the line on our Taoiseach to veto this deal,” he said.“There’s dferent opinions as to whether Ireland has a veto or not, butwe have that veto, we need to use it to stop this deal progressing.”When askedhe felt the Taoiseach cared about farmers, Mr Healy replied: “Time will tell, MrVaradkar has much to do in terms of not selling rural Ireland out to get this Mercosur deal over the line, and also in relation to Brexit, he needs to ensure farmers are safeguarded from all the negotiations over Brexit.”"},{"url":null,"title":"suspected human leg bone found on irish beach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

in on Tuesday, two days after conservative party leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis won early elections on pledges to make the country more business-friendly, cut taxes and negotiate an easing of draconian budget conditions agreed as part of the country’s rescue programme..pushThe new Cabinet relies heavily on experienced politicians who have served in previous governments, but also includes non-politician technocrats considered experts in their fields.The crucial post of finance minister went to Christos Staikouras, an economist and engineer who comes with the experience of having served as deputy minister during the financial crisis under a previous government.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Greece’s prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis “Our central aim is to create the conditions for a high and sustainable development with healthy public finances and a stable banking sector,” Mr Staikouras said during the handover of the ministry from his predecessor, Euclid Tsakalotos.“We will go ahead with relieving the tax burden on households and businesses,” Mr Staikouras said.“We will promote production, productivity, competitiveness, quality, adaptability and an outward looking approach of our economy.”The new government’s promise for lowering taxes, and calls to ease the strict budget targets, was bluntly rejected by Greece’s creditors during the bailout year, even before the country had formed its new government.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Nikos Dendias has been named as foreign minister Finance ministers from the  European Union countries that use the euro currency met in Brussels on Monday evening and insisted key budget targets must be adhered to.“Commitments are commitments, andwe break them, credibility is the first thing to fall apart. “That brings about a lack of confidence and investment,” Mario Centeno, president of the so-called Eurogroup, said after the meeting.Greece depended for years on rescue loans from other European Union countries and the International Monetary Fund infor deep reforms to the country’s economy that included steep tax hikes and major spending cuts.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Greece’s new Cabinet takes an oath during the swearing in ceremony at the Presidential palaceThe price was heavy as unemployment and poverty levels soared in the country.Greece’s third and final international bailout ended last year and while the country does not rely on direct funds to meet its debt repayments, the previous government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras agreed to meet a series of budget targets over the coming years, even decades.As part of those agreements, Greece has pledged to achieve government budget surpluses, before debt costs, of .% of GDP for the coming years.Critics say that requirement has shackled government spending and stled the country’s recovery.As a result of those agreements, Greece remains under strict surveillance from its euro partners.Mr Staikouras said that unlike frequent practices at ministry handovers during a change of government, he would not say everything his predecessor had done was wrong.“We will maintain any positive things that were done and we will build on them,” he said.“But we will correct mistakes and deal with any oversights.”Other key positions in the new Cabinet also went to seasoned political veterans.The foreign ministry was given to Nikos Dendias, who held previous Cabinet positions in the ministries of development, defence and public order, while a former public order minister under a previous socialist government, Michalis Chrisohoidis, takes the reins of the ministry once again as one of Mr Mitsotakis’ non-parliamentary appointees."},{"url":null,"title":"indonesia sends back waste containers to western

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again.

Our community was able to enjoy the excellent spectacle of the pipe bands, the skill of the drum majors and the highland dancers and overall the competition created a brilliant atmosphere that all the family could enjoy.”The organisers have expressed their appreciation and thanks to Ballymena Academy for the use of its grounds.Ulster-born Labour MP Kate Hoey announces retirement from politics after  years as Vauxhall MP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -  photographs as mourners bid final farewell to victims campaignerMan dies in tragic incident on major N.I. roadPeople injured and hospitalised after three vehicle collisionIN PICTURES:  photos from the  Ulster University graduationsN.I.

The second thing has been watching people grow in their faith and use their gts for the Lord as well as seeing how amazing they become under God’s transformation”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p Phyllis is keen to acknowledge the role that her husband, David has played in her le and work.She said: “He was already a member of the congregation although it took me a while to find him! I must say the best thing that ever happened in my le was marrying David. He has become a real partner not only as my husband but in the ministry as well and I really couldn’t have done this job without his support over the years.”Phyllis admitted that she will miss the ‘fantastic’ staff team at West Church.She said: “I will miss the day to day things of ministry, particularly visiting people at home and in hospital. Those relationships are very special and precious. People make le what it is so often through the relationships you build with them. It is a privilege to be part of people’s lives and to have them trust you enough to share their inner-most thoughts and confidences.“I would love to thank all of the congregation who have made me part of the family at West. They have given me such joy and a peace in my work every day as I spend time with them.”The retiring Deaconess had particularly warm words for Rev. Daniel Kane, who has led the Ministry Team at West Church for  years.She said: “Daniel has been the best boss any Deaconess could ever have. He is a great man of vision but more than anything he enables staff to grow in their faith and to use the God-given gts with which they have been supplied. He sets you free to do ministry.”Catholic leader blasts abortion proposals by MPs Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -  photographs as mourners bid final farewell to victims campaignerMan dies in tragic incident on major N.I. roadPeople injured and hospitalised after three vehicle collisionIN PICTURES:  photos from the  Ulster University graduationsN.I.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives. I look forward to what we can achieve in the future.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.

North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening.
