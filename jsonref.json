Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u0027s COO and first female board member, said allowing new mothers to work part-time would put too much of a strain on the rest of the team          Khuner\u0027s story brought in a range of supportive comments on her personal Facebook too          Users shared how they thought she was brave for revealing her story and quitting her jobKhuner wrote that she told him: \u0027I want to know: Would you give us part-time, work-from-home, and extended leave options right now, not later would you lead this company and the US in supporting working parents would you give us the chance to show you how kick-ass and loyal we can be with fewer hours at the desk, if you weren\u0027t afraid?\u0027Zuckerberg maintained that employees would have to wait for a change in the way they approach family-work balance but Khuner mentioned Facebook supports parents in other ways.A $4,000 handout goes to new moms and dads, childcare expenses are partially reimbursed, and there are many lactation rooms for breastfeeding mothers.But it\u0027s not a substitute for precious time spent with children she concluded. It\u0027s something Zuckerberg should agree with. He regularly shows off his family on his own Facebook profile, documenting his paternity leaves with daughters August and Maxima in 2016 and 2017.He also shares snaps of himself never failing to miss birthdays and various specious occasions with his little girls and wife Priscilla.  Khuner thinks flexibility will lead to companies like Facebook saving money in the long run by retaining staff and having employees who are willing to put more into the jobs that are giving back to them.There might even be a chance of her making a return in the future.She finished the article: \u0027I told Facebook when they make that change, they know where to find me.\u0027 Why It\u0027s So Hard to Be a Working Mom.

Jeff Flake, whose vote could make or break Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s Supreme Court nomination, is indicating he would vote no on the nominee unless he hears from Christine Blasey Ford          Brett Kavanaugh needs to be voted out of the Judiciary Committee before his nomination can move to the Senate floorKavanaugh needs to get through the Senate Judiciary Committee before Republican leaders can schedule a floor vote to finalize his confirmation.If Flake votes no in committee, given the Democratic opposition, it would be a tie-vote and that means Kavanaugh would not have the committee\u0027s recommendation to be confirmed.His nomination could still be brought to a vote to the Senate floor but, given the Republicans 51-seat majority, if Flake votes no again, the GOP cannot lose a single other senator if all Democrats vote no. In 1991, Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas passed out of the Judiciary Committee on a tie 7-7 vote. He was confirmed by the entire Senate 52-48.Kavanaugh\u0027s committee vote is scheduled for Thursday although Democrats are trying to delay it. Flake is retiring from the Senate after this year - a decision he made after repeated hammering from Trump. He has been a harsh critic of the president both during the presidential campaign and since Trump took office.Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary panel, is working to schedule followup phone calls between Kavanaugh, Ford, and committee staff on both sides of the aisle. \u0027The Chairman and ranking member routinely hold bipartisan staff calls with nominees when updates are made to nominees\u0027 background files. Given the late addendum to the background file and revelations of Dr. Ford\u0027s identity, Chairman Grassley is working to set up such followup calls with Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford ahead of Thursday\u0027s scheduled vote,\u0027 he said in a statement Sunday evening.  Flake isn\u0027t the only Republican who wants to hear from Ford, whose bomb shell interview in The Washington Post on Sunday rocked the foundations of Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination.   Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he was willing to have Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee but he wants it done before Thursday\u0027s scheduled vote.\u0027If (Christine Blasley) Ford wishes to provide information to the committee, I would gladly listen to what she has to say and compare that against all other information we have received about Judge Kavanaugh,\u0027 Graham said in a statement on Sunday.\u0027If the committee is to hear from Ms. Ford, it should be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled,\u0027 he added. Additionally, two of the other key Republican votes in the Senate are women - Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins - neither of whom face voters this year and both of whom said they are with holding judgement of Kavanaugh until after his confirmation hearing is concluded. Collins told CNN Sunday evening that she\u0027s \u0027very surprised\u0027 about the Kavanaugh allegation and \u0027it\u0027s an issue that I brought up with him last Friday and he denied\u0027 it. She said she will be \u0027talking with my colleagues\u0027 about whether Thursday\u0027s committee vote should go forward.    Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called for Kavanaugh\u0027s Thursday\u0027s vote to be delayed          Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, left, has also called for a delay          Brett Kavanaugh is President Trump\u0027s second nominee to the Supreme CourtThe White House was hoping to pick up some Democratic votes - particularly Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota - all of whom voted for Trump\u0027s first nominee Neil Gorsuch and who face voters this fall in their home states, which the president carried in the 2016 election. All have said they are undecided.Also undecided are Democratic Senators Jon Tester of Montana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, both of whom are in tough re-election contests in states Trump carried in 2016. Democrats are calling for Thursday\u0027s vote to be delayed until sexual assault allegations against him can be investigated.Their revitalized push againstTrump\u0027s nominee comes after his accuser publicly identified herself as Christine Blasey Ford, a university professor in California, and offered a chilling account of a high school incident where she alleged Kavanaugh attacked her. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the FBI should reconsider its decision and investigate before his nomination comes to a vote before the committee.\u0027From the outset, I have believed these allegations were extremely serious and bear heavily on Judge Kavanaugh\u0027s character. However, as we have seen over the past few days, hey also come at a price for the victim. I hope the attacks and shaming of her will stop and this will be treated with seriousness it deserves,\u0027 she said in a statement on Sunday.She concluded: \u0027It is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation. This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nomination.\u0027 Additionally, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has called on Grassley to postpone Thursday\u0027s vote until the allegations are investigated.\u0027Senator Grassley must postpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated. For too long, when woman have made serious allegations of abuse, they have been ignored.

Senator Feinstein should publicly release the letter she received back in July so that everyone can know what she\u0027s known for weeks.\u0027The committee voted last week - before talk of an allegation against Kavanaugh became public - to vote on whether to move his nomination forward on Thursday.If Kavanaugh makes it out of committee, Republicans are aiming for a full Senate confirmation  before the Supreme Court term begins Oct. 1.          Christine Blasey Ford is going public with her allegation against Brett Kavanaugh          Christine Blasey Ford said she was worried Brett Kavanaugh might kill her during a drunken high school assault back in the 1980sBut one by one Democrats called for a delay after Ford went public with her story, saying she thought Kavanaugh might kill her during an alleged drunken high school attack.\u0027I thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u0027 said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California, to The Washington Post. \u0027He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u0027Ford described in detail how, when she was at a teenage party in the 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend followed her upstairs when she went to the bathroom and pushed her into a bedroom. She detailed how Kavanaugh alleged held her down, tried to rip off her swimsuit, and groped her.She said she escaped when his friend, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them.Kavanaugh has vigorously denied the allegations.              Sen. Kamala Harris is one of six Democrats on the committee calling for the Kavanaugh vote o be delayed          Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he\u0027s open to having Christine Ford testifyDemocrats on Sunday praised Ford for coming forward while Republicans rushed to Kavanaugh\u0027s defense.Republicans  are expected to question Ford\u0027s memories and why Democrats sat on the accusations, sources in the White House told Politico.Additionally Trump is expected to go after Ford, those sources said.  A lawyer close to the White House told the news website Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination will not be withdrawn.\u0027No way, not even a hint of it,\u0027 the lawyer said. \u0027If anything, it\u0027s the opposite. If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. We can all be accused of something.\u0027Other Republicans point out Kavanaugh has passed numerous FBI background checks when he was White House staff secretary for George W. Bush and as a federal judge, a position that saw him confirmed by the Senate.Democrats on the Judiciary Committee offered a consistent voice on delaying the vote.Seven of the committee Democrats thus far have called for the vote to be delayed. \u0027At a bare minimum, this week\u0027s scheduled committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh\u0027s lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court must be postponed until this matter is fully and thoroughly investigated,\u0027 said Sen. Cory Booker, who\u0027s mentioned as a possible White House 2020 candidate. \u0027The Senate Judiciary Committee must now give these allegations the serious weight they deserve. They must be fully and fairly investigated. Unquestionably, the Kavanaugh confirmation vote must be delayed,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. \u0027This was a very brave step to come forward. It is more important than ever to hit the pause button on Kavanaugh\u0027s confirmation vote until we can fully investigate these serious and disturbing allegations. We cannot rush to move forward under this cloud,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. \u0027Christine Blasey Ford courageously stepped forward to tell her story — it is a credible and serious allegation. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility to scrutinize SCOTUS nominees. A vote on Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination must be delayed until there is a thorough investigation,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, who is mentioned as a possible 2020 presidential contender.\u0027It took a lot of courage for Christine Blasey Ford to come forward to share her story of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh. Her story is very credible \u0026amp I believe her,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Mazie  Hirono. \u0027This development is yet another reason not to rush Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination.\u0027  Christine Blasey (now Ford) and Brett Kavanaugh in their respective high school year books          Flake is casting doubt on Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination \u0027I admire the courage Ms. Ford has shown in coming forward with her story. This requires a pause, at a minimum, in the unseemly, special-interest-funded rush to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Court,\u0027 said Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse.In late July, Ford sent a letter to Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo, her California congresswoman, about the high school incident. Eshoo passed the letter to Feinstein. Feinstein passed the letter to the FBI - with Ford\u0027s name redacted. The agency  declined to investigate but sent it to the White House, who passed it on to all members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u0027Upon receipt of the information on the night of September 12, we included it as part of Judge Kavanaugh\u0027s background file, as per the standard process,\u0027 the FBI said.    Kavanaugh¿s accuser steps forward, putting onus on GOP - POLITICO"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/16/23/5040F0C000000578-6174303-image-a-12_1537135477740.jpg","title":"Theresa shouts answers chase drinks tea new documentary","story":"    A new documentary will reveal how Theresa May and her husband Philip like to watch teatime game show The Chase when they can          The BBC Panorama programme, to be screened tonight, shows the couple catching up over a cup of tea in front of the television          The couple, who celebrated their 38th wedding anniversary earlier this month, met whilst studying at Oxford UniversityDespite working on papers from her red box, Mrs May, 61, chips in with answers to some of the questions on the ITV quiz show.The footage was filmed at the Prime Minister’s country residence Chequers on Friday afternoon.Mr May, 60, who had just returned from a business trip to America, is understood to be a fan of quiz shows and also enjoys BBC Two’s Eggheads.Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan is only a temporary solution and a...May warned to get her \u0027act together\u0027 and deliver sanctions...Share this articleThe couple, who celebrated their 38th wedding anniversary earlier this month, met whilst studying at Oxford University.Mrs May has previously credited her husband with helping her through the tragedy of both her parents passing away when she was aged 25, the year after they had married.Speaking on Desert Island Discs in 2014, she said: ‘I had huge support from my husband, and that was very important for me.

She gave it unhesitatingly.Even as Powell and the PM spoke, the double agent himself was being smuggled, thousands of miles away, across the Russian border into Finland and safety in the boot of a Ford saloon car.His name was Oleg Gordievsky, widely acknowledged to be the most valuable secret service mole at the heart of the KGB during the latter decades of the Cold War.He was 46 then, and 79 now.          Oleg Gordievsky receives the Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and Saint George from Queen Elizabeth II for his services to UK security (pictured in 2007)He continues to defy Moscow but has escaped the fate of subsequent turncoat and defector Sergei Skripal, a victim of the Salisbury Novichok poison attack.So why are you reading about Gordievsky today?Because a new book revives claims that Michael Foot was in the pay of the Soviet Union when he was leader of the Labour Party in the late Eighties.Such is the world of espionage that these claims are impossible to verify but in his book, The Spy And The Traitor, the respected intelligence historian Ben Macintyre reveals that MI6 found them credible and that Secret Intelligence Service chiefs were prepared to tell the Queen if Foot ever became prime minister.          Gordievsky graciously accepted the award from the Queen, wearing top hat and tails. He receives a £20,000-a-year pension from MI6The source of the allegations was Gordievsky.Foot, he said, had met his KGB handlers over lunch at the Gay Hussar, a Hungarian restaurant in London’s Soho, and received the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money for being ‘a confidential contact’.The accusations were first published in the Sunday Times two decades ago. Foot fiercely challenged the story and won a famous libel victory against the newspaper. He continued to deny the accusations until his death at the age of 96 eight years ago.Whatever the truth about Agent Boot — the KGB’s pseudonym for Foot, apparently, a play on his name — the controversy has turned the spotlight on the enigmatic figure of Gordievsky.          Gordievsky first came to the attention of the West in the Sixties when based in Copenhagen, running Soviet spies in Denmark and was thought to be vulnerable to blackmail after being spotted buying homosexual pornography in the city’s red light districtIn 2007, he was made a Companion to the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) ‘for services to the security of the UK’. Fittingly, this is the same honour given to James Bond. Gordievsky graciously accepted the award from the Queen, wearing top hat and tails. He receives a £20,000-a-year pension from MI6.Ever since his defection, Gordievsky has lived comfortably in the Surrey suburbs, for most of that time with his long-term British-born companion Maureen. Salmon canapes and red Bulgarian wine are said to regularly grace their dining table.So how did he escape from the Moscow shadows to become the greatest asset our secret services have ever turned?Gordievsky first came to the attention of the West in the Sixties when based in Copenhagen, running Soviet spies in Denmark and was thought to be vulnerable to blackmail after being spotted buying homosexual pornography in the city’s red light district.In fact, as Macintyre explains in his book, he had been intrigued by gay practices and had taken the magazines home to show his then wife Yelena and place them on the mantelpiece as ‘an open exhibition of freedom unavailable in Soviet Russia’.Gordievsky did make a pass at Western intelligence, however, after becoming disenchanted with the Soviet system and its brutal repression of the 1968 Prague Spring, when tanks were sent into Czechoslovakia to crush the growing reform movement.His feelings were picked up by MI6 when a defector informed it that Gordievsky had shown ‘clear signs of political disillusionment’.A surreptitious approach was duly made when he was playing a morning game of badminton with a female member of the Young Danish Communists.It was, to quote Macintyre, the beginning of the ‘career’ of ‘Britain’s greatest ever spy’.In 1982, more than a decade after being recruited on the badminton court, Oleg Gordievsky was posted to the Russian Embassy in London where he would be made the ‘resident’ — the head of the KGB in Britain. His swift advancement was helped by the fact that MI6 arranged for his immediate superiors to be kicked put of Britain.It meant that Gordievsky provided a valuable insight into Soviet thinking at a crucial stage of the Cold War.Three years after settling in London, though, Gordievsky was suddenly summoned back to Moscow where he was subjected to a lengthy interrogation that involved the administration of a truth drug someone — in the CIA, it was suspected — had betrayed him.Gordievsky may not have cracked, but he knew the game was up. It was time to activate Operation Pimlico, the daring escape plan already formulated by MI6 in the event of such an eventuality.But how to get him out of Russia when he was under such scrutiny? The chain of events that were set in motion proves the old adage, that truth is indeed sometimes stranger — and in this case, at least, infinitely more fascinating — than fiction.In his flat on 103 Leninsky Prospect in Moscow, Gordievsky retrieved a hardback copy of Shakespeare’s sonnets, and soaked the flyleaf so he could peel it off. Inside, he found a sheet containing his escape instructions, which he committed to memory.So he found himself standing on a Moscow street corner, as per the instructions, at 7pm on July 16, 1985, clutching a Safeway carrier bag. Safeway bags bore a large letter ‘S’, an immediately recognisable logo that would stand out in the drab surroundings of the Soviet capital.This was the signal — to British agents working in an office across the street — that his cover had been blown, and that he needed to be pulled out of the Motherland immediately.Exactly 24 minutes later, a man walked passed him carrying a Harrods bag eating a chocolate bar Gordievsky had been told in advance that it might be a Kit Kat or a Mars bar. In fact, it was a Mars bar. The man was an MI6 officer.‘As he passed within four or five yards, he stared straight at me,’ Gordievsky recalled in his memoirs. ‘I gazed into his eyes shouting silently, “Yes, its me! I need urgent help”.’Gordievsky had already said goodbye to his wife and two daughters, whom he would not see until the end of the Soviet regime.He took a train north to Leningrad, Russia’s second city, from where he made his way to the town of Zelenogorsk, up the coast from the Baltic Sea.Next, he caught a bus heading for the Russian-Finnish border (the nearest East-West frontier to Moscow) where the border guards were accustomed to seeing diplomatic vehicles pass through checkpoints.Gordievsky hid in bushes until the car, with two MI6 operatives inside, arrived to pick him up.One of the officers opened the bonnet of the Ford, which was Gordievsky’s signal to emerge from the undergrowth. After scrambling into the boot, he was wrapped in a space blanket to deflect the infrared cameras and heat detectors believed to be deployed at Soviet borders, and given a tranquiliser pill.If the plan failed, Gordievsky knew that he would taken back to Moscow and shot.But it was a success.Some time after Gordievsky was driven across the Finnish border, the head of MI6 made an urgent appointment to see Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher’s private secretary, at No 10, and explained that Operation Pimlico was under way, and that the personal authorisation of the Prime Minister herself was urgently required.‘We have to honour our promises to our agent,’ she would tell Powell, not realising that Gordievsky was already on his way back to Britain in the boot of a car.For his part, Gordievsky has since said he has no regrets about betraying the KGB and says there is nothing he misses about Russia. ‘Everything here is ine’ compared to Russia, he declared in a subsequent interview.Gordievsky has little contact with his daughters, Mariya, 38, and Anna, 37, or his former wife Yelena. They joined him in Britain in 1991 after extensive lobbying of former leader Mikhail Gorbachev by Margaret Thatcher, but after being apart for six years, the marriage ended.How valuable an asset was Gordievsky? There was no new Cambridge spy ring, no network of KGB agents that had ‘wormed their way into the establishment in order to destroy it from within’. The most explosive ‘revelation’ was that Moscow was ‘prepared to use dirty tricks and hidden interference’ to swing an election in favour of Michael Foot — an ‘intriguing harbinger of modern times’, according to Macintyre.More importantly, perhaps, he opened up the inner workings of the KGB at a key moment in history. When he came to Britain Gordievsky was secretly briefing both sides, under the guidance of MI6. He told the Russians what to say to the British — and warned the British what the Soviet delegation would say to them, triggering the end of the Cold War.Since settling here, he has worked as a security adviser and has often appeared on TV as an expert on Russian espionage.He has been a consultant editor for the journal of National Security and co-hosted the Channel 4 show Wanted in the Nineties, in which contestants had to complete a list of challenges without being detected by a ring of spymasters.Gordievsky remains a passionate Anglophile, subscribing to The Spectator and penning articles for the Literary Review. Paintings hanging on the walls of his home in Surrey reflect his love of avant-garde art. One of his great pleasures, he says, is feeding the foxes who visit his garden.There has been only one sinister episode during this gilded life in the stockbroker belt.In 2008, he spent 34 hours unconscious in hospital after falling ill at his home. He was initially paralysed and still has no feeling in his fingers. He claimed he was the victim of a Kremlin-inspired assassination plot.‘I’ve known for some time that I am on the assassination list drawn up by elements in Moscow,’ he said at the time. ‘It was obvious to me that I had been poisoned.’He said he was poisoned with thallium, a highly toxic metal used in insecticides which was favoured by the KGB in assassinations during the Cold War.Of course, this poisoning claim sounds eerily like what happened earlier this year in Salisbury.Indeed, it seems that stories about Kremlin assassins, Soviet defectors and British Left-wing politicians who are deemed Moscow’s useful idiots will continue to run and run. But surely none can surpass that of the superspy who came in from the cold. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/16/15/503288C600000578-0-image-m-56_1537108716557.jpg","title":"Politicians wear glasses likely voted power study suggests","story":"    When 203 people were shown 16 pictures of politicians, they said they were most likely to vote for those with spectacles like, Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured)When 203 people were shown 16 pictures of politicians, they said they were most likely to vote for those with spectacles. Those in glasses were seen as clever and were liked more regardless of their party, further research found.Vince Cable denies \u0027running out of road\u0027 as Liberal Democrat...\u0027It\u0027s so undemocratic\u0027: Sadiq Khan is lashed by the Tories...Share this articleA study led by the University of Cologne concluded that eyewear offers \u0027an easy, effective and robust way for politicians to change their facial features and increase the probability of electoral success in the West (as long as competence is important)\u0027. The psychologists said politicians try to avoid wearing glasses in public because of possible associations with \u0027vision deficiency, old age and weakness\u0027.Donald Trump taunted rival Jeb Bush during the 2016 US presidential campaign about getting contact lenses \u0027to look cool\u0027.

Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u0027s COO and first female board member, said allowing new mothers to work part-time would put too much of a strain on the rest of the team          Khuner\u0027s story brought in a range of supportive comments on her personal Facebook too          Users shared how they thought she was brave for revealing her story and quitting her jobKhuner wrote that she told him: \u0027I want to know: Would you give us part-time, work-from-home, and extended leave options right now, not later would you lead this company and the US in supporting working parents would you give us the chance to show you how kick-ass and loyal we can be with fewer hours at the desk, if you weren\u0027t afraid?\u0027Zuckerberg maintained that employees would have to wait for a change in the way they approach family-work balance but Khuner mentioned Facebook supports parents in other ways.A $4,000 handout goes to new moms and dads, childcare expenses are partially reimbursed, and there are many lactation rooms for breastfeeding mothers.But it\u0027s not a substitute for precious time spent with children she concluded. It\u0027s something Zuckerberg should agree with. He regularly shows off his family on his own Facebook profile, documenting his paternity leaves with daughters August and Maxima in 2016 and 2017.He also shares snaps of himself never failing to miss birthdays and various specious occasions with his little girls and wife Priscilla.  Khuner thinks flexibility will lead to companies like Facebook saving money in the long run by retaining staff and having employees who are willing to put more into the jobs that are giving back to them.There might even be a chance of her making a return in the future.She finished the article: \u0027I told Facebook when they make that change, they know where to find me.\u0027 Why It\u0027s So Hard to Be a Working Mom.

She gave it unhesitatingly.Even as Powell and the PM spoke, the double agent himself was being smuggled, thousands of miles away, across the Russian border into Finland and safety in the boot of a Ford saloon car.His name was Oleg Gordievsky, widely acknowledged to be the most valuable secret service mole at the heart of the KGB during the latter decades of the Cold War.He was 46 then, and 79 now.          Oleg Gordievsky receives the Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and Saint George from Queen Elizabeth II for his services to UK security (pictured in 2007)He continues to defy Moscow but has escaped the fate of subsequent turncoat and defector Sergei Skripal, a victim of the Salisbury Novichok poison attack.So why are you reading about Gordievsky today?Because a new book revives claims that Michael Foot was in the pay of the Soviet Union when he was leader of the Labour Party in the late Eighties.Such is the world of espionage that these claims are impossible to verify but in his book, The Spy And The Traitor, the respected intelligence historian Ben Macintyre reveals that MI6 found them credible and that Secret Intelligence Service chiefs were prepared to tell the Queen if Foot ever became prime minister.          Gordievsky graciously accepted the award from the Queen, wearing top hat and tails. He receives a £20,000-a-year pension from MI6The source of the allegations was Gordievsky.Foot, he said, had met his KGB handlers over lunch at the Gay Hussar, a Hungarian restaurant in London’s Soho, and received the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money for being ‘a confidential contact’.The accusations were first published in the Sunday Times two decades ago. Foot fiercely challenged the story and won a famous libel victory against the newspaper. He continued to deny the accusations until his death at the age of 96 eight years ago.Whatever the truth about Agent Boot — the KGB’s pseudonym for Foot, apparently, a play on his name — the controversy has turned the spotlight on the enigmatic figure of Gordievsky.          Gordievsky first came to the attention of the West in the Sixties when based in Copenhagen, running Soviet spies in Denmark and was thought to be vulnerable to blackmail after being spotted buying homosexual pornography in the city’s red light districtIn 2007, he was made a Companion to the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) ‘for services to the security of the UK’. Fittingly, this is the same honour given to James Bond. Gordievsky graciously accepted the award from the Queen, wearing top hat and tails. He receives a £20,000-a-year pension from MI6.Ever since his defection, Gordievsky has lived comfortably in the Surrey suburbs, for most of that time with his long-term British-born companion Maureen. Salmon canapes and red Bulgarian wine are said to regularly grace their dining table.So how did he escape from the Moscow shadows to become the greatest asset our secret services have ever turned?Gordievsky first came to the attention of the West in the Sixties when based in Copenhagen, running Soviet spies in Denmark and was thought to be vulnerable to blackmail after being spotted buying homosexual pornography in the city’s red light district.In fact, as Macintyre explains in his book, he had been intrigued by gay practices and had taken the magazines home to show his then wife Yelena and place them on the mantelpiece as ‘an open exhibition of freedom unavailable in Soviet Russia’.Gordievsky did make a pass at Western intelligence, however, after becoming disenchanted with the Soviet system and its brutal repression of the 1968 Prague Spring, when tanks were sent into Czechoslovakia to crush the growing reform movement.His feelings were picked up by MI6 when a defector informed it that Gordievsky had shown ‘clear signs of political disillusionment’.A surreptitious approach was duly made when he was playing a morning game of badminton with a female member of the Young Danish Communists.It was, to quote Macintyre, the beginning of the ‘career’ of ‘Britain’s greatest ever spy’.In 1982, more than a decade after being recruited on the badminton court, Oleg Gordievsky was posted to the Russian Embassy in London where he would be made the ‘resident’ — the head of the KGB in Britain. His swift advancement was helped by the fact that MI6 arranged for his immediate superiors to be kicked put of Britain.It meant that Gordievsky provided a valuable insight into Soviet thinking at a crucial stage of the Cold War.Three years after settling in London, though, Gordievsky was suddenly summoned back to Moscow where he was subjected to a lengthy interrogation that involved the administration of a truth drug someone — in the CIA, it was suspected — had betrayed him.Gordievsky may not have cracked, but he knew the game was up. It was time to activate Operation Pimlico, the daring escape plan already formulated by MI6 in the event of such an eventuality.But how to get him out of Russia when he was under such scrutiny? The chain of events that were set in motion proves the old adage, that truth is indeed sometimes stranger — and in this case, at least, infinitely more fascinating — than fiction.In his flat on 103 Leninsky Prospect in Moscow, Gordievsky retrieved a hardback copy of Shakespeare’s sonnets, and soaked the flyleaf so he could peel it off. Inside, he found a sheet containing his escape instructions, which he committed to memory.So he found himself standing on a Moscow street corner, as per the instructions, at 7pm on July 16, 1985, clutching a Safeway carrier bag. Safeway bags bore a large letter ‘S’, an immediately recognisable logo that would stand out in the drab surroundings of the Soviet capital.This was the signal — to British agents working in an office across the street — that his cover had been blown, and that he needed to be pulled out of the Motherland immediately.Exactly 24 minutes later, a man walked passed him carrying a Harrods bag eating a chocolate bar Gordievsky had been told in advance that it might be a Kit Kat or a Mars bar. In fact, it was a Mars bar. The man was an MI6 officer.‘As he passed within four or five yards, he stared straight at me,’ Gordievsky recalled in his memoirs. ‘I gazed into his eyes shouting silently, “Yes, its me! I need urgent help”.’Gordievsky had already said goodbye to his wife and two daughters, whom he would not see until the end of the Soviet regime.He took a train north to Leningrad, Russia’s second city, from where he made his way to the town of Zelenogorsk, up the coast from the Baltic Sea.Next, he caught a bus heading for the Russian-Finnish border (the nearest East-West frontier to Moscow) where the border guards were accustomed to seeing diplomatic vehicles pass through checkpoints.Gordievsky hid in bushes until the car, with two MI6 operatives inside, arrived to pick him up.One of the officers opened the bonnet of the Ford, which was Gordievsky’s signal to emerge from the undergrowth. After scrambling into the boot, he was wrapped in a space blanket to deflect the infrared cameras and heat detectors believed to be deployed at Soviet borders, and given a tranquiliser pill.If the plan failed, Gordievsky knew that he would taken back to Moscow and shot.But it was a success.Some time after Gordievsky was driven across the Finnish border, the head of MI6 made an urgent appointment to see Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher’s private secretary, at No 10, and explained that Operation Pimlico was under way, and that the personal authorisation of the Prime Minister herself was urgently required.‘We have to honour our promises to our agent,’ she would tell Powell, not realising that Gordievsky was already on his way back to Britain in the boot of a car.For his part, Gordievsky has since said he has no regrets about betraying the KGB and says there is nothing he misses about Russia. ‘Everything here is ine’ compared to Russia, he declared in a subsequent interview.Gordievsky has little contact with his daughters, Mariya, 38, and Anna, 37, or his former wife Yelena. They joined him in Britain in 1991 after extensive lobbying of former leader Mikhail Gorbachev by Margaret Thatcher, but after being apart for six years, the marriage ended.How valuable an asset was Gordievsky? There was no new Cambridge spy ring, no network of KGB agents that had ‘wormed their way into the establishment in order to destroy it from within’. The most explosive ‘revelation’ was that Moscow was ‘prepared to use dirty tricks and hidden interference’ to swing an election in favour of Michael Foot — an ‘intriguing harbinger of modern times’, according to Macintyre.More importantly, perhaps, he opened up the inner workings of the KGB at a key moment in history. When he came to Britain Gordievsky was secretly briefing both sides, under the guidance of MI6. He told the Russians what to say to the British — and warned the British what the Soviet delegation would say to them, triggering the end of the Cold War.Since settling here, he has worked as a security adviser and has often appeared on TV as an expert on Russian espionage.He has been a consultant editor for the journal of National Security and co-hosted the Channel 4 show Wanted in the Nineties, in which contestants had to complete a list of challenges without being detected by a ring of spymasters.Gordievsky remains a passionate Anglophile, subscribing to The Spectator and penning articles for the Literary Review. Paintings hanging on the walls of his home in Surrey reflect his love of avant-garde art. One of his great pleasures, he says, is feeding the foxes who visit his garden.There has been only one sinister episode during this gilded life in the stockbroker belt.In 2008, he spent 34 hours unconscious in hospital after falling ill at his home. He was initially paralysed and still has no feeling in his fingers. He claimed he was the victim of a Kremlin-inspired assassination plot.‘I’ve known for some time that I am on the assassination list drawn up by elements in Moscow,’ he said at the time. ‘It was obvious to me that I had been poisoned.’He said he was poisoned with thallium, a highly toxic metal used in insecticides which was favoured by the KGB in assassinations during the Cold War.Of course, this poisoning claim sounds eerily like what happened earlier this year in Salisbury.Indeed, it seems that stories about Kremlin assassins, Soviet defectors and British Left-wing politicians who are deemed Moscow’s useful idiots will continue to run and run. But surely none can surpass that of the superspy who came in from the cold. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/16/15/503288C600000578-0-image-m-56_1537108716557.jpg","title":"Politicians wear glasses likely voted power study suggests","story":"    When 203 people were shown 16 pictures of politicians, they said they were most likely to vote for those with spectacles like, Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured)When 203 people were shown 16 pictures of politicians, they said they were most likely to vote for those with spectacles. Those in glasses were seen as clever and were liked more regardless of their party, further research found.Vince Cable denies \u0027running out of road\u0027 as Liberal Democrat...\u0027It\u0027s so undemocratic\u0027: Sadiq Khan is lashed by the Tories...Share this articleA study led by the University of Cologne concluded that eyewear offers \u0027an easy, effective and robust way for politicians to change their facial features and increase the probability of electoral success in the West (as long as competence is important)\u0027. The psychologists said politicians try to avoid wearing glasses in public because of possible associations with \u0027vision deficiency, old age and weakness\u0027.Donald Trump taunted rival Jeb Bush during the 2016 US presidential campaign about getting contact lenses \u0027to look cool\u0027.

The authors, writing in the journal Social Psychology, say glasses have commonly been worn by those performing intellectual or highly-skilled work, so they are associated with \u0027success, dependability and industry and intelligence\u0027.Theresa May, who wears glasses in the Commons, is unusual among Prime Ministers in doing so.

The anonymous retired agent claimed Russian military intelligence uses \u0027liquidators\u0027 to kill enemies - but doubts that the men named as Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov (right) are plausible as killersMoscow has already come up with dozens of versions, the British have alleged.But unusually the former GRU staffer conceded that the Russians use death squads, and might have done so in the Skripal case.\u0027Of course, such people exist, not only in the Russian secret service but in any other too,\u0027 he said.He also claimed that the pair seen on CCTV may have been replaced by actors for the stilted RT broadcast last week when they went public to deny any involvement.\u0027The main question about Petrov-Boshirov is not if they are killers or gay tourists,\u0027 he said. The main one is if they are really Petrov and Boshirov.\u0027It might well have been like this: the British secret service located two people and considered them to be liquidators.\u0027And the Russian authorities quickly found two similar looking guys and appointed them Petrov and Boshirov.\u0027Unimpressed with their performance he said: \u0027Somebody just did not spend much time searching - and first two suitable guys from the service were taken. They are soldiers and could not disobey the order.\u0027The pair in Salisbury should have been taught to watch out for CCTV cameras and mask their traces, he said.\u0027The problem is that in England, as far as I know, the density of such cameras is very high.\u0027So at the stage of preparation the task had to be different – not to avoid the cameras but to mask well. How to hide traces?\u0027Well, the first thing is not to make any traces – not to live together (in the same hotel), not to arrive and leave together, not to approach the Skripals\u0027 house together.\u0027Savaging their espionage tradecraft in Salisbury, he said: \u0027If these two guys (Petrov and Boshirov) really are intelligence officers, if they were truly involved in this attempt to liquidate the Skripals, then it means that (our) whole authority has collapsed. And this is truly horrible.\u0027The only other option was that they were part of a \u0027mafia\u0027 operation to kill ex-GRU agent Skripal because he had been involved in criminal work, possibly in Spain, he said. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/08/5040F28D00000578-6175215-Mrs_May_has_previously_credited_her_husband_with_helping_her_thr-a-16_1537168270529.jpg","title":"Rally drivers high speed race comes abrupt end bonnet suddenly flies open","story":"    Rally car drivers Art McCarrick and John McCay from Ireland are shocked when a bumper flies up and blocks their viewThey soon reach a straight stretch and the driver immediately accelerates.But suddenly the bonnet flies up and smacks against the windscreen, completely blocking his view of the road.I found the perfect way to beat traffic jams - dodge \u0027em!...Share this articleOne of the rally racers screams \u0027Oh!

They suggested Katerina Anghelaki-Rooke, whose collection in English, The Scattered Papers of Penelope, “is a team work … a poetry collection filled with Katerina’s talent and made with a lot of meraki”.The Scattered Papers of Penelope is a fascinating and well-organised “New and Selected”. As the title suggests, one of its strategies is to imagine the woman poet as a modern Penelope, liberating her from confinement to the original Homeric narrative but retaining some of its symbolic opportunities: “I wasn’t weaving, I wasn’t knitting  I was writing something  erasing and being erased  under the weight of the word.” (Penelope Says, translation by Karen Van Dyck). There are inidual poems, prose poems and short sequences, translated by various hands, including the editor’s and the poet’s own. The poster didn’t specify a favourite poem so I have chosen one of mine, The Barber Shop, which I think fulfils the first commandment of a poem in translation: to open new horizons in the reader’s familiar language.The poem begins with a startling image evoking a presumably male muse. The heterosexuality shouldn’t be allowed to disconnect Anghelaki-Rooke from Sappho and her tradition. Technical complexity is less amenable to translation, but the passion and observation of the earlier poet are qualities abundantly present in Anghelaki-Rooke. The Barber Shop exemplifies the immediacy of her love poems and their erotically driven stories.Once we’ve put together the metaphorical pieces of the opening image, we find a startlingly new, masculine flower, almost exotic, but apt and beautiful. (The “white rose” represents the towel, the face of the man being barbered is like the shining beetle, “clinging to the petals” of the surrounding cloth). It will be developed and enriched in later lines, gradually inclining more towards realism. Meanwhile, metaphor-making continues, and the narrative enters time. Past and present tenses mix, perhaps to show how memory blurs perception of the temporal: “Clippings scattered on the floor  were the days when I loved you so much  while the garrulous  sculptor of heads cuts away  what time had made superfluous.”The directness and simplicity of the diction, eg the intensifier in “loved you so much”, allows a “spoken” emotional authority to ground the classical allusions and inventive metaphor-making. The poem is of course retrospective, not a love letter but a voicing of unassuaged regret. The addressee is encountered, tragically, at the beginning of an inevitable loss, the visionary moment after which “nothingness …  came crawling into the scented room”. An impassioned personal voice is essential, and the translators capture it.In the future predicted by the speaker, the “garrulous sculptor of heads” (a splendid image of the barber!) becomes a kind of male Atropos, severing the metaphorical thread of the speaker’s life. As the Wikipedia entry reminds us, in Plato’s Republic “the three Moirai sing in unison with the music of the Seirenes. Lachesis sings the things that were, Clotho the things that are, and Atropos the things that are to be”. It seems that the song of the Fates has been quietly chanted throughout this poem.Anghelaki-Rooke was born in Athens in 1939, and is an internationally acclaimed poet and translator. Introducing her work in the current collection, the editor stresses that many of her more recent poems focus on “gender and language”, and concludes her selection with a poem from 2002, Translating Life’s End Into Love. It’s featured on this page, in a different English translation, but one that is vivid and compact. Some of the poet’s own thoughts on her art can be read here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5fe6777d141c811f451993a890588dea0b4d9e3/0_2_3201_1921/master/3201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd6f3ce60f7f83f35e89ef1ba8d7f3c9","title":"david sedaris its fascinating the things you see when youre out on foot","story":"Exclusive essay for  Cities:  David Sedaris has walked through cities all over the world and the worst, by far, is BangkokLike most people, I’ve been walking since I was a year old. I started doing it seriously when I was 13 or so, and as a result my calf muscles are massive, like hams. My family’s house was at the furthest edge of Raleigh, North Carolina – in the last suburb there was – so in the beginning, I’d walk in the country. Then, like an overturned bucket of molasses, the town grew. One development followed another, and I found myself wandering through neighborhoods so new they smelled of plywood, which actually smells of formaldehyde. Driving didn’t appeal to me for some reason. Working didn’t either, but my parents forced me to earn my own money when I turned 16. I found a job in a cafeteria – washing dishes – and would most often walk there and back. “That far!” my friends would say. It surprised me to learn that none of them would think of covering that distance on foot.I’ve always had an active fantasy life, so that’s what I devoted my walking hours to: daydreaming. The life I imagined for myself trudging through Raleigh, soaked through with filthy dishwater, was exactly the life I wound up with. “I’m going to write books and live overseas with a ridiculously good-looking, artistic boyfriend. Then I’ll buy a beach house everyone can use and …”I don’t know what it is with Americans yelling out their car windows at cyclists and people on foot, especially in the country. It’s happened to me only once in the UK – out of all the miles I’ve covered. I was collecting rubbish along the side of the road outside the village of Storrington when a guy – red-faced with rage – stuck his head out the window of his white van. “Bin man!” he yelled.In America it’s always faggot for some reason, which is odd, as shopping seems much gayer to me than walking along the road and I’m never singled out in stores, not even in ones that sell capes. Of course the allure of such name calling is anonymity – the quick escape. The last time it happened I was in Dayton, Ohio, with my friend Adam who is not gay and, to my mind, would never be mistaken for gay. “Faggot love,” caroled a girl riding in a passing car with friends. She was halfway out the window, in a tank top, her long, straw-colored hair blowing in the breeze. I often think of her, and wonder where she is now, which federal prison or rehab center. Rotting away, poor thing.It’s fascinating, the things you see when you’re out on foot. I was in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, once, walking through a suburban neighborhood, when I came upon a slice of pizza lying face down in someone’s driveway. “What on earth?” I said to myself, as I stood staring down at it. I’ve discovered far more disgusting things – human turds come to mind, coddled in a rain-soaked pair of Y-fronts and being feasted upon by slugs – but nothing has ever moved me quite like that slice of pizza. It’s what comes to mind now whenever I think of Wisconsin. Not cheese or Joseph McCarthy. Not even the visits I made with my first real boyfriend and the crazy sex we had in motels there, both of us so young.Just that slice of pizza.When I think of Normandy, where I spent a dozen summers, and where I walked for miles every afternoon, I think of vicious dogs. That was the problem with the country side near La Bagotière, the hamlet where our house was. By law your animals had to be either penned or tethered, but in what I came to think of as a very French way, no one ever thought the rules should apply to him. “Don’t worry,” farmers would call at the sight of me in the middle of the road, slowly backing away from their snarling mastiff or German shepherd. “He doesn’t bite.”Alghero, in Sardinia, was bad that way as well. That was a good thing about walking in Reykjavik. Dogs were technically banned there until 2006. You could apply for an exception, but I’m guessing it was a pain as I only saw one during my entire five-day visit, and he looked like he’d give his front paws for an asshole other than his own to sniff.I don’t recall dogs in Dubai either. I was there with my old friend Dawn, a fellow Fitbit wearer. We both put in a good 15 to 20 miles a day, but changed our schedules due to the heat and did most of our walking at night. The place we stayed at was not grand in any way – nothing like the shimmering towers that city is known for. My room’s one window was nine feet off the ground. Also odd was that my door was secured from the outside – with a padlock – but not from within. It was sort of like jail. The neighborhood we stayed in was lively at night, but sober lively, the kind where men hung out at groups at 3am, talking quietly and drinking apricot juice. Most were workers from India or Pakistan or the Philippines, husbands separated from their families and living eight to a padlocked room. On several occasions during our stay, we walked to a 24-hour Indian supermarket. On the second floor, in a sad little clothing section, we came upon a bedazzled sweatshirt with the word “Activity” written on it. No particular team, let alone sport. This was as hypnotizing to me as that slice of pizza in Wisconsin.In Abu Dhabi we walked a promenade along the riverfront, marveling yet again at the sight of all these unintoxicated people. Midnight, and there was none of the aggressive drunken energy you’d find in the UK. No one shouting or kicking over trash cans. No one saying: “What are you looking at?”Also refreshing, and really sweet, were the great numbers of young children out with their parents at midnight.When do they sleep? we wondered.When do they? the kids likely wondered back, as Dawn and I were out until all hours. “Just one more mile,” she would say. “Did I say one? I meant two.”I’ve walked through cities all over the world, and the worst, by far, is Bangkok. It might be different if you’re a man with his wife or sister, but when you’re alone, you get taken for a sex tourist, and are hounded every moment of the day and night. “Psst, you looking for girls? Young girls? I got girls.”You’re followed and hectored and yanked at. Ho Chi Minh City is bad for that as well, though at least the women offered there are fully grown. The problem with the Vietnamese pimps is that you can’t easily cross the street to escape them. The traffic in that country doesn’t stop for anything. People tell you to proceed as you normally would, that the cars and scooters will go around you – and they do, but I was never convinced I wasn’t going to get struck down. And so I’d walk around and around the block my hotel was on, and get asked every 10 seconds if I was looking for a woman.That happened in Hong Kong as well. My boyfriend Hugh and I were wandering about after dinner, and again and again I was propositioned. That had happened on a few occasions when I lived in Chicago, back when I was in my 20s and I recall being flattered. It’s not that I wanted to be a straight man, but there was a definite freedom in being able to pass as one. Now, though, in my mid-50s, I found it, if not insulting, then at least depressing. First off, why was it always me being propositioned, and never Hugh? Unlike him, I supposed, I looked single. Not the sort who’d chosen bachelorhood, but the sort it had been imposed upon, the type for whom having sex meant paying for sex. Either that or I looked like the guy who’d go on a business trip, get together with a prostitute I met on the street, and then return to my family. “How was Hong Kong?” my wife or daughter might ask.“Oh,” I’d moan, duplicitous to the core, “the same.”The fifth time I was propositioned, I told the woman who’d offered herself that I was gay.“What business is that of hers?” Hugh asked.“I didn’t want her to think that my saying no had anything to do with her personally,” I told him. “I don’t want her to think she’s not pretty enough.”‘You’re ridiculous,” he said.As cities around the world close central streets to cars to mark World Car-Free Day,  Cities is looking at the joys and trials of urban walking.The US humourist and writer David Sedaris tells us about walking in cities from Raleigh to Reykjavik. Will Self explains what he learns from perambulations in London, there’s Fran Lebowitz in New York, Helen Garner in Melbourne, “natural navigator” Tristan Gooley in Portsmouth, and writers on Delhi and Newcastle, Cairo and Wellington.Laura Laker casts a critical eye on the performance of Vision Zero, the global city scheme to eliminate traffic deaths. London has signed up – will it enjoy the success of New York, or the delays of LA? The recent blocking of Sadiq Khan’s plans to pedestrianise Oxford Street does not bode well.Correspondent Stephen Burgen samples the newfound silence in the Spanish car-free city of Pontevedra, and Matthew Keegan discovers what prompted Hong Kong to reopen a popular pedestrian street to vehicles.Renate van der Zee looks at the rise, fall and rebirth of the Lijnbaan in Rotterdam – Europe’s first pedestrianised street – while Rachel Aldred at the University of Westminster crunches the numbers to identify the most dangerous London boroughs for people on foot.Oliver Wainwright explores the City of London’s forgotten Pedways – and asks whether these 1960s walkways can make a comeback.We consider the phenomenon of “desire lines”, examine the art of following a stranger in the hope of seeing a city in a new light, and much more.The next prostitute wondered if I wanted a beautiful lady, and the one after that asked where I was going. I told her, and she offered to walk me back to my hotel and stay with me for as long as I wanted. “That’s OK,” I told her. “I’m a homosexual.” I don’t think her English was too good, as this only caused her to ask again. “A fag?” I said. “A faggot?”“I have places to walk to. Lots of places, so I need to be outside.”I turned to Hugh for help and saw him rounding the corner at high speed. With my map in his hand. And my phrase book in his back pocket.“Miles to walk,” I continued as the woman took my hand. “Miles and miles and miles.”We’re eager to hear your thoughts and experiences of walking in cities.

Michael Gove is right. The reckless, crash-bang-wallop of the hard-Brexit fantasists has had its day. They have not produced a plausible future for British trade with Europe. The default option is now “crashing out”, and that is infantile. Of course the Chequers proposal has problems. But it takes the UK out of the EU and keeps frictionless trade with EU members. Both were always pledged by the prime minister as constituting Brexit. The EU asked for Britain’s proposals to meet this pledge, and now has them. It should negotiate them.Gove may have his own motives for showing sweet reason. He is on a roll while his rival Boris Johnson is off with the fairies – he should try telling Yorkshire that England “acquiesced” in the Norman conquest as he did in his  column today. Chequers leaves trade in goods unimpeded, while services have always been subject to ad hoc deals. This has nothing to do with taking back control. All trade requires compromise on regulatory standards, in or out of the EU. To be a part of Europe’s single market, as Thatcher insisted, is blatantly in Britain’s interest. The EU’s deals with the rest of the world are far more effective than any the UK could get alone.That Chequers is disliked by remainers and leavers alike is probably the best argument for it. Either way it is the one game in play. That is why it is irresponsible for Labour’s Keir Starmer and the Liberal Democrats’ Vince Cable both to say their parties will vote against a Chequers-based settlement in parliament. It clearly does not help UK negotiators. And do these remainers really think the UK will then revert to full EU membership?The consequence of parliament not ratifying Chequers would be a numbing chaos. How that helps either side is a mystery. There would be no time for a general election or another referendum, which again would decide nothing. It would probably involve some clock-stopping ritual and a worse Chequers. Westminster appears to have gone bonkers, Cable and Starmer included.Finding common ground on single-market continuity has to make sense, along with some deal on EU passports pending a new and urgent approach to migration across Europe. Britain should clearly stay with various EU agencies, as agreed under Chequers. Only Luddites and xenophobes could seriously want to end all collaboration in law, security, science and medicine. Gove is therefore right. This is a traumatic moment for the UK. While talk of cataclysm may be exaggerated, politicians are toying with people’s livelihoods. Once the UK has withdrawn, once frictionless trade has been defined and resolved, the UK can sit back and assess the benefits and disbenefits of its new status in Europe’s economic space.It can then retreat further from the EU, or return to a closer relationship. Both options can be contemplated. No parliament can bind its successors. The referendum itself proved that. The UK must just get over this hurdle, with the least damage done."},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron merchandise french mugs","story":"Outrageously expensive T-shirts, bracelets and tote bags do nothing for the French president’s image at a time of crisisT-shirts are emblazoned with catchphrases he has used in debates, such as croquignolesque (“cute but ridiculous”) and poudre de perlimpinpin (“snake oil”, a charge he used against Marine Le Pen). Another depicts Macron’s silhouette punching the air, from a viral photo taken at the World Cup final. Kids can colour in a giant poster of the Macrons for just €14,90. You can even buy blue, white and red macarons – sadly, no one thought to make the obvious pun. Perhaps rebranding the much-loved French treat would have taken the cult of personality a step too far.For Macron, whose ascent to the presidency formed the perfect PR narrative, the shop is very on-brand. It also promotes French-made products – one of his missions. But it is nonetheless extremely tone deaf. Not only are the souvenirs about him, rather than the Elysée they are also outrageously priced. Taking the biscuit are three gold bracelets inscribed with the French values of liberté, égalité, fraternité for €250 each. Only days before the shop launched, Macron inaugurated his plan to tackle poverty. For a man often lampooned as “president of the rich”, a €250 “equality” bracelet made of gold is not necessarily the best signalling.Other gaffes were soon revealed: the Macron mugs, described as real porcelain from Limoges, turned out not to be made of the material. (“It’s croquignolesque”, the Limoges porcelain makers union commented.) A sweatshirt emblazoned “Français” (€115) was judged nationalist. The shop’s tote bags (€19) read président (the word for a male president) or “first lady” – there is no version for a would-be female president.Twitter quickly turned the T-shirts into memes rewritten using Macron’s worst soundbites: that time when he compared “people who are successful and those who are nothing” or when he said “we spend a crazy amount of dough” on welfare or when he told protesters to “stop making a mess and look for a job”. And of course, there was a Free Benalla T-shirt, referencing Macron’s former bodyguard, Alexandre Benalla, who assaulted demonstrators at a May Day march while dressed as a police officer, igniting a scandal in France over the summer.Ironically enough, it has since been revealed that while still in his Elysée job, Benalla was tasked with launching the shop. He told the police: “One of my responsibilities is the creation of an online shop to sell goodies.”Last week, Benalla refused to attend a hearing by the senate committee investigating his case. Far from distancing itself, the French government closed ranks around Benalla: Macron called the president of the senate to complain, and his justice minister, Nicole Belloubet, warned: “Parliament cannot interfere with the judicial power.” The Elysée spokesperson even accused the senate of being a “threat to the Republic”, looking to “undermine Emmanuel Macron”.With the French executive and legislature wrestling over a case that could be damaging to Macron, his new merchandiseoffered a welcome distraction. And who knows – the online store may still add the Free Benalla T-shirt to its collection.• Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in Britain.

Preferably in a movie whose title sounds like a Nirvana song.Take Vox Lux, which sees Natalie Portman chasing a second Oscar as a jaded pop chameleon. Burdened by scandal, past trauma, celebrity and extreme eye makeup, but buoyed by some electro-pop stompers (courtesy of Sia), she is an emblematic 21st-century woman on the edge and off the rails. Portman gives it her all.You could say the same for Elisabeth Moss, who trades Handmaid for bandmate in Her Smell. She plays Becky Something, the talented, difficult leader of a 90s grunge band who is on the verge of meltdown (substance abuse, family baggage, the usual suspects). Director Alex Ross Perry describes it as “a five-act tragedy about girl punk bands”. Screen International describes it as “Sporadically brilliant, occasionally unbearable”.Destined for a future double bill with Her Smell is Teen Spirit, in which Elle Fanning plays a pop competitor from the Isle of Wight. Fanning has form in this area, having recently portrayed an alien who discovers the liberating spirit of punk in Croydon-set sci-fi oddity How to Talk to Girls at Parties (featuring Nicole Kidman in full Toyah mode). In it, Fanning ended up fronting a punk band, clad in clingfilm and eyeliner in Teen Spirit she is living the Pop Idol fantasy, but she can sing. Serving a grittier variation on the same theme is Wild Rose, with rising star Jessie Buckley (last seen in Beast) as a Glasgow ex-con and single mum who dreams of being a country singer.It’s about time. Women dominate pop, something that hasn’t been put on screen in a meaningful way until now. The 1980s had cult films such as Ladies and Gentlemen the Fabulous Stains, a spirited tale of punk stardom, with then-unknowns Diane Lane and Laura Dern. There was Hazel O’Connor in punk saga Breaking Glass, and more recently the Runaways biopic, with Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart. But it has mostly been male-dominated biopics or glossy pop confections such as Mariah Carey’s Glitter.Ironically, the current frontrunner in this new pop star race is a performer crossing the floor in the opposite direction: Lady Gaga. Her performance in Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born has stolen the limelight from the “proper” actors. While they are channelling the real-life Gaga for their on-screen personas, Gaga has ditched the costumes and showed she can really act – and sing at the same time.

Each warm, sunny day is bookended by crisp mornings and cool evenings. There is a distinct change of climate at the stove, too: the jars of beans and lentils have come down from the larder shelf there is meat cooking slowly on its bones and there are proper puddings in the oven. As a cook, I’m in my element, but also as a shopper, with the best of both seasons at my fingertips. After just one too many salad days of a long, hot summer, this cook has never been happier to be back in the kitchen.In autumn I like to roast a duck with figs – the seedy fruit is pleasing against the rich, soft flesh of the bird. The idea works in casserole form, too, with the duck simmering to tenderness with celery, onion and thyme and the fruit introduced at the last minute. I do think it essential to brown the duck first and utilise its fat for lightly browning the vegetables.I’m not sure you need anything “on the side”. But pushed, I would offer a bowl of bitter leaf salad.Set the oven at 220Cgas mark 7. Put the duck pieces into a casserole or deep-sided roasting tin, then into the hot oven for 30 minutes.While the duck is in the oven, peel the shallots but leave them whole. Roughly chop the carrots and celery. The duck should be lightly brown in places and starting to sizzle. Remove from the oven and lower the temperature to 180Cgas mark 4. Lift the duck pieces from the dish and set aside.Put the casserole or roasting tin over a moderate heat, add the shallots, carrots and celery, and fry for 5 minutes in the fat left behind by the duck until they are lightly coloured, stirring them from time to time. Drain the duck fat from the tin, keeping it for later (it will keep in the fridge for a few days and makes cracking roast potatoes). Return the duck to the pan and mix with the vegetables, tuck in the thyme, pour in the water and bring to the boil.Cover the dish with a lid and transfer to the oven. Roast for 1 hour and 30 minutes, then remove the duck pieces from the casserole and keep warm. Cut each fig in half, then push them down into the gravy and place over a medium heat. Chop the parsley and stir it into the gravy. Bring to the boil and let it bubble for about 10 minutes, till the liquid is reduced by half. You need just enough to moisten the meat, fruit and vegetables. Return the duck to the sauce and serve.Short of a tray of damsons, I can think of nothing that marks our journey into autumn quite like the sight of a proper pumpkin. By proper I mean a round one rather the ubiquitous butternut. A pumpkin as big as your head.Serves 3pumpkin 2kgolive oil 4 tbsphot chicken or vegetable stock1 litredouble cream 200ggrain mustard 1 tbspsmooth dijon mustard 1 tbspCut the pumpkin into six large wedges. Remove and discard the seeds and fibres. Warm the olive oil in a large, deep-sided roasting tin over a moderate heat. Lightly brown both cut sides of each wedge of pumpkin, turning them over as each one colours using kitchen tongs.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Lay the wedges of pumpkin on their side then pour over the hot chicken or vegetable stock and seal the roasting tin with kitchen foil. Bake for 45 minutes then remove the foil, turn the pieces of pumpkin over and baste them thoroughly with the stock. Return to the oven and continue cooking for a further 45 minutes. The pumpkin should be translucent, each slice heavy with stock.Carefully lift the pumpkin from the stock and set aside on a warm serving dish. Place the stock over a fierce heat and let it reduce to about 200ml. Pour in the cream, then stir in the two mustards, a little at a time, until you have a warmth you like. Season with salt and black pepper.Spoon the mustard sauce over the slices of pumpkin and serve.The point of a pot roast is the intensely flavoured broth that surrounds the meat. A mash of some sort will merge deliciously with the broth in your dish.Serves 4pork knuckle 1.2kgolive oil 3 tbsp, plus extra for rubbingonions2 mediumcelery 2 sticksgarlic 3 large clovesfresh ginger 50gground cinnamon ½ tspchilli flakes ½ tspcinnamon stick 1black grapes 200gwater 500mlhoney 1-2 tbspTo finishparsley 10 sprigspistachios 2 tbsp, shelledmashed potato or celeriac to serveRub the pork with a little oil then season with salt. Warm the 3 tbsps of oil in an oven-proof casserole or deep roasting tin then lightly brown the meat on all sides, turning it as necessary. Set the oven at 170Cgas mark 3. Remove the pork from the pan and set aside.Peel and roughly chop the onions. Return the pan to the heat then add the onions, letting them soften over a low to moderate heat. Slice the celery into 2cm lengths then stir into the onions. Peel the garlic and add whole to the pan. Peel the ginger, cut into slices as thick as a pound coin, then stir into the vegetables and cover the pan with a lid. Continue cooking for five minutes, stirring from time to time.Stir in the ground cinnamon, chilli flakes and cinnamon stick, add half the grapes, then pour in the water and 1 tbsp of the honey. Season with salt and ground black pepper.Return the pork to the pan together with any of its juices that may have escaped while resting, then cover with a lid or a sheet of tin foil and place in the oven. Leave for an hour and a half, turning the meat over halfway through.Check the pork for doneness. You should be able to pull it from the bone with ease. If it resists, continue cooking for a little longer. Correct the seasoning with more salt, black pepper and the remaining honey as you think fit. Introduce the reserved grapes and return to the oven, lid off, for a further 20 minutes.Remove the pan from the oven, leave to rest, lid on, meat still in its juices, for a good 15 minutes. Remove the parsley leaves from their stalks and roughly chop them. Chop the pistachios and toss with the parsley. Pull the meat and fat from the bone and serve in thick slices in shallow bowls, with mashed potato or celeriac if you wish. Spoon the cooking juices and vegetables over as you serve, and scatter with the parsley and pistachios.Filming in Iran last year, the crew would often end their long working days at a hotel buffet, or what, at 11pm, was left of it. I grew exceptionally fond of ash reshteh, a deeply consoling soup thick with beans, flat noodles and chickpeas. Recipes varied at each locale, as indeed they should, but the soothing nature of the dish never faltered. I make a version of that dish, with a final addition of very lightly cooked spinach, using linguine for want of the traditional, difficult-to-find reshteh noodles.

Roughly chop two of them and thinly slice the others. Warm the olive oil in a large pan set over a moderate heat, add the two chopped onions and fry them for 10-15 minutes till soft and pale gold. Peel and thinly slice the garlic. Stir in the garlic and ground turmeric and continue cooking for a couple of minutes.Drain the chickpeas and haricot beans and stir them into the onions together with the lentils and stock. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and leave to simmer for 30 minutes, stirring the pan occasionally.Melt the butter in a shallow pan, then add the reserved sliced onions and let them cook slowly, with the occasional stir, until they are a rich toffee brown. This will take a good half an hour.Add the linguine or noodles to the simmering beans. Wash the spinach, put it in a separate pan set over a medium heat, cover with a lid and leave it for 3 or 4 minutes until it has wilted. Turn occasionally with kitchen tongs. Remove the spinach and put it in a colander under cold running water until cool.Wring the moisture from the spinach with your hands then stir into the simmering stew. Roughly chop the parsley, coriander and mint leaves and stir most of them into the onions and beans.Fold in the soured cream, then ladle into bowls and fold in the remaining herbs and the fried onions.To interfere with the simplicity of a crumble crust feels a bit like arguing with God, but I don’t think He’d object to the addition of almonds.

Stir in the apple juice, sprinkle over the pinch of cinnamon, tip in the blackberries and set aside. Set the oven at 180Cgas mark 4.Make the crumble: rub the butter into the flour, either using your fingertips or a food processor, until you have fine crumbs, then fold in the ground almonds. Tear the marzipan into small cubes, about 2cm in size, and stir into the crumble.Transfer the apples and blackberries to a deep baking dish approximately 22cm x 24cm. Loosely scatter the crumble over the fruit, then the flaked almonds. Bake for about an hour until the crumble is golden and a little of the fruit has bled into the crust here and there. Leave the crumble to calm down for 10 minutes or so before serving, if you wish with double or sour cream."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/737fb40fe5ec7bd7e01e9345201742572b471c29/6_110_2993_1796/master/2993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27167125ea652e8a40f36939fb3f8a60","title":"harry kane struggling spurs liverpool defeat","story":"Star striker’s form is just one of a growing number of issues for Mauricio Pochettino to contend with after Spurs’ limp display against LiverpoolHarry Kane knows the drill. When things go wrong, the highest-profile players find themselves in the crosshairs. It is hard to overstatehow badly things went wrong for Tottenham on Saturday in a chastening 2-1 Premier League defeat to Liverpool at Wembley.Mauricio Pochettino clung to the positives, the Spurs manager noting his players had fought until the end and that they almost had an unlikely shot at salvation. After the substitute Érik Lamela had reduced the deficit on 93 minutes, another substitute, Son Heung-min, ought to have had a 95th-minute penalty after he was clipped by Sadio Mané. The referee, Michael Oliver, was unsighted.In truth a reprieve would have been brutally unjust because until the 85th minute, when Tottenham finally exerted some penalty-area pressure, it had been one-way traffic. Liverpool cut through their hosts from the first whistle, their runs in behind the Spurs lines a persistent threat. But for some loose final balls and lax finishing, it would have been a thrashing.Kane had a good view of it all, looking back from his position at the tip of Spurs’ formation. It was an afternoon when the striker was a mere bystander. According to the statistics, he touched the ball only 22 times and three of those were on kick-offs.It was difficult to remember him doing much inside the box. He ran straight into Trent Alexander-Arnold in the first half, could not direct a flick in the 67th minute and sent a tame looping header towards Alisson on 86.And so to the scrutiny. What is wrong with Harry?Gareth Southgate set a theory in train this week when he said he had left him out of the starting XI for the friendly against Switzerland last Tuesday because he needed a rest. After a gruelling World Cup, Pochettino gave Kane three weeks off but, after returning to training on the Monday before the beginning of the season in early August, he has played virtually every minute of Tottenham’s five games.Neither Kane nor Pochettino give any credence to the notion that there is a problem regarding energy levels and it should be said that when Kane is fit, he starts. It has always been that way at Spurs under Pochettino. Kane’s workload is so prodigious as to invite wonder and furrowed brows. Surely, he would benefit from a few more rests?He has not done too badly without them so far in his career and he made an interesting point after the Liverpool match. “We have a run coming up where we play game after game after game and that’s what I like,” he said. “You can get into a rhythm and I can get into positions where you know where to score goals.”The question that nags more alarmingly is whether Kane has been affected by the ankle ligament injury he suffered at Bournemouth in March and from which he returned after only three weeks. The statistics have shown that he has since taken fewer shots and, moreover, fewer first-time shots. One of Kane’s trademarks is setting himself in a flash and unloading instantly. Has the injury affected his reaction times?Against Liverpool, Kane was handled impeccably by Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez. But his anonymous performance was not only down to Liverpool’s central defenders – it had plenty to do with his teammates and you suspected he wanted to make that point more vigorously than he did.“People are always going to look for stuff, especially when you are a big part of the team and someone who is there to get the goals,” Kane said on Saturday. “As a team we can all do better and as the striker you get spoken about more.”Tottenham sleepwalked to defeat and it was remarkable to see how negligent they were with the ball. They had the bulk of the possession but they looked vulnerable, with the latest errornever far away. When they came, Liverpool snapped forward with menace.Eric Dier endured a traumatic game, having been shoehorned into an unfamiliar position on the right of a midfield three, and he was guilty of a series of lapses. He was far from being the only one and Pochettino was particularly upset that his team were unable to build up from the back – one of the touchstones of his style. This was due, in part, to Liverpool’s pressing, but it was faintly shocking to hear Pochettino cite a fear factor. In short, a platform for Kane was never constructed.“We were a little bit scared to play out from the back,” Pochettino said. “That translates after to the different lines – to the midfield and the offensive line. We conceded a lot of chances. There was a lack of pace and confidence and that surprised me because when you play with a defensive line with a lot of experience, you should show more confidence in your skill.”The problems were technical – throughout the lineup – and it is difficult to ignore the feeling that something is not right at Spurs. “I know we won our first three games but we were saying between ourselves that we can do better,” Kane said.Next up for them is the Champions League opener at Internazionale on Tuesday. Kane is not the only one who needs to raise his game at San Siro."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87a5f710b1b8f6966f84ab6e195d93340dd14dc1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ff8681b3e52cdcc457810bf9530d3fd","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekend action","story":"Ryan Fraser ran Leicester ragged Neil Warnock will not tolerate more Cardiff mistakes and Rafael Benítez needs a new planJürgen Klopp was asked to describe his emotions during stoppage time in the 2-1 victory at Tottenham. His dominant Liverpool team had led 2-0 going into it but they conceded to Érik Lamela in the 93rd minute to set up a nervy finale. “I would love to say it is the first time in my life I have been in a situation like that but it happens so often,” Klopp said. “My wife hates it.” The Liverpool manager would not have gone through the wringer if some of his players – Sadio Mané, in particular – had played in a teammate when they ought to have done. If there was one criticism of Liverpool’s best performance of the season it was the lack of ruthlessness and, even, traces of greediness. “It’s not greedy,” Klopp argued. “I want them to score and encourage them to do so. But there are moments when they have to pass.” David HytnerNo more “little old Burnley”, Sean Dyche exuded calm after the defeat against Manchester United before the international break, but there was a shift in the manager’s tone after this latest setback. Reeling from a fourth successive league defeat, in a season that has seen Burnley’s European adventure come to an end before it had a chance to really get started, Dyche admitted “we’ve got a bit of a fog around us at the moment” and implied his players need to change their mentality. “I told them after the game, every year it has been ‘little old Burnley’, but they’re now recognised because of last season. You have to grow with that. It should be something to be enjoyed.” Dyche has his work cut out to turn things around, not least because the malaise is more deep-rooted than some might think – Burnley have won only five of their last 26 league games. Stuart JamesOne of football’s simplest joys is the little guy making undignified fools of men twice his size. Ryan Fraser’s majestic display on Saturday was a custard pie in the faces of Wes Morgan and Harry Maguire, who spent the afternoon running through the gamut of defensive clumsiness: sliced passes, botched first touches, clanging mistimed tackles. Maguire should have been sent off for a pair of lumbering lunges Morgan was handed a red card for exactly that. The Leicester captain could claim both bookings were harsh but his dismissal added to the suspicion that he is on borrowed time, especially with Jonny Evans waiting in the wings. Morgan’s heroics during the title-winning season make him an immortal figure at Leicester but, in a rather more immediate sense, you wonder how much more life he has in him. Alex HessThere were times when Cardiff City had Chelsea worried at Stamford Bridge. They never stopped trying and Neil Warnock was right to say that his players were not intimidated by Maurizio Sarri’s side. Yet Cardiff were punished for minor lapses in concentration after taking an improbable early lead through Sol Bamba. Chelsea punished their mistakes, with Eden Hazard scoring a hat-trick, and Warnock knows that survival will depend on his team shedding their naivety. Hazard equalised when he dodged a poor challenge from Joe Bennett and the game was over as a contest when Bamba conceded a penalty by fouling Willian. “I can’t accept it,” Warnock said after the game. “I’ve got to say to the players: ‘You can make a mistake once, but if you do it twice I’ve got to leave you out.’ If you want to be in the team you can’t make the mistakes. Not at this level.” Jacob SteinbergIn some respects Lucas Digne had a very good game. He had four shots, more than any other Everton player apart from Gylfi Sigurdsson, and he effected four key passes, when no teammate managed more than one. Nor did any Everton player win more than his two aerial duels. Even a quick glance at his defensive stats – seven tackles, four more than any teammate, and two interceptions – suggests a player who was dominant. But the question rapidly becomes why the £18m signing from Barcelona was making so many tackles, and the answer is probably that he was repeatedly caught out of position, his attacking thrusts rendering him vulnerable to Andriy Yarmolenko’s pace and direct running. It’s no coincidence that two of West Ham’s three goals came down his flank. The suggestion was Digne lacked the technical capacity for Barça here it is the defensive side of his game that is being examined. Jonathan WilsonYou knew when Ashley Young got the ball in Manchester United’s win over Watford even without watching the game. The boos that rang out from the home crowd when their former player touched the ball were enough to alert you, which was pretty frequently in the first half, at least. No longer the spry winger of his days at Vicarage Road, Young is a full-time full-back now, and his fine performance in defence meant United didn’t miss the rejuvenated Luke Shaw, concussed on England duty, especially as both goals came directly or indirectly from Young’s set-piece delivery. Still, after the game Jose Mourinho quickly confirmed Shaw would start United’s Champions League opener against Young Boys on Wednesday: a sign of his fresh faith in Shaw, but also proof that while United might have plenty of problem areas, left-back isn’t one of them. Nick Miller“Wilfried Zaha needs more protection from referees,” is a regular grievance from everyone associated with Crystal Palace, including the player. It is a fair complaint because he tends to suffer particularly rough treatment, although not from Huddersfield on Saturday, apart from one late tackle by Mathias Jørgensen. Afterwards Roy Hodgson said Zaha deserved “enormous credit” for insisting on playing so soon after the groin injury that forced him to miss the defeat by Southampton, explaining “he is so determined to get back on the field that the doctors and physios can’t keep him back”. Maybe so, but the manager could keep him back if there are concerns about his fitness. Instead Hodgson said he was “concerned” about the player throughout the game and would have substituted him if Huddersfield had not been pressing for an equaliser. Perhaps it is not only referees who need to protect Zaha more. Paul DoyleRafael Benítez has problems. After trying to sneak counterattacking wins courtesy of smothering tactics, he switched to a high press against an Arsenal defence acclimatising to the stress placed on Petr Cech by Unai Emery’s insistence on routinely playing out from the goalkeeper. Newcastle still lost. They have collected one point – at Cardiff – from five games, equalling their worst start to a Premier League campaign, under Ruud Gullit in 1999. Admittedly they have faced four top-six teams and Benítez’s blueprints ensured no defeat was comprehensive. But Newcastle lack sufficient quality to convert enough chances. Although Arsenal were frequently shaky, inidual talent airbrushed their collective structural flaws. Tellingly, Granit Xhaka altered the narrative with a game-changing free-kick before Mesut Özil’s goal sealed things. “If you have players with quality they can win games,” Benítez said. “Even if something’s wrong.” Louise TaylorWatford’s unblemished start may have come to an end with the 2-1 home defeat against Manchester United, but Javi Gracia is still feeling the positivity that four successive victories bring. “I am sure all of them will stay angry,” the manager said after his side were denied a point by David de Gea in stoppage time at Vicarage Road. “If we lose we have to do it like today – fighting until the end, trying to score until the end, competing until the end. This is our attitude. We don’t have to change anything.” With the rejuvenated Troy Deeney leading from the front, Gracia has every reason to think that his Watford side can maintain their momentum when they travel for the first of three away games to Craven Cottage on Saturday to face Fulham before meetings with Tottenham, in the Carabao Cup, and then Arsenal.

But Hopkins – who had confused Monroe with the columnist Laurie Penny – refused to back down, resulting in a costly court case, with the commentator forced to pay £24,000 in damages and a substantially larger sum in legal costs.Meanwhile, her mainstream media career collapsed. She parted ways with Mail Online, for whom she had written a regular column, in late 2017, only a few months after losing her LBC radio show when she called for a “final solution” in response to the Manchester Arena terrorist attack. She now works for the far-right Canadian outlet Rebel Media.Hopkins, who has already had to sell her Devon home, applied for an inidual voluntary arrangement (IVA) in May, a filing on the Inidual Insolvency Register shows. Monroe told the  that the agreement, which will allow Hopkins to avoid bankruptcy and manage the long-term repayment of her debts, was recently formally agreed following discussion with creditors.Agreed monthly repayments are paid to the insolvency practitioner, who will deal with the creditors for the lifetime of the IVA. If the payments into the IVA are not enough to repay the debts in full, the rest will be written off. Last year there were 59,220 new IVAs in England and Wales.An IVA is a form of insolvency. It differs from bankruptcy, where assets are transferred to a trustee, who then sells them and distributes the proceeds to creditors. When the bankruptcy order is over you can make a fresh start, usually after a year. Those who declare bankruptcy are allowed to keep certain things, like household goods and a reasonable amount to live on.Hopkins, whose tweets suggested she is on a trip to Poland, did not immediately return a request for comment.“It’s really quite sad – two tweets cost her her house, job, and now her credit rating,” said Monroe, reflecting on the case, which has taken more than three years in total.“I’m supposed to be jubilant and celebratory but I feel quite mixed up. Having been close to the edge of bankruptcy myself, it’s a hideous situation to be in, but it was completely avoidable. Things are in place in that agreement to make sure her children are looked after. I’m a mother myself and I read it line by line to make sure that her children didn’t suffer as a result of what she’s done.”Hopkins shot to fame as a contestant on The Apprentice in 2007, later billing herself as “Britain’s most controversial columnist” and appearing on the US TV network Fox News, during which time then-presidential candidate Donald Trump called her a “respected columnist” for her writing on “the UK’s Muslim problems”.Earlier this year, she successfully won a complaint against the Daily Mirror after its website gave the impression that she was prevented from leaving South Africa for taking ketamine. She said the claim could be damaging to her reputation as, in reality, her passport had been briefly confiscated over allegations she had been spreading racial hatred, rather than for using medically-prescribed drugs.After Monroe revealed the existence of the IVA, social media users drew attention to a tweet Hopkins published in 2014 suggesting that people in debt typically blamed others for their predicament.Monroe warned that Hopkins could be turned into a martyr and pushed further to the extremes by the verdict. “She could have had a glittering career ahead of her,” she said. “I hope this is an opportunity to regroup and reconsider how best to provide for her family without ending up in court or being pushed further to the margins. I don’t know if it’s a fire that’s burning out or a fire that we’re pouring petrol on.”“My offer of a cup of tea still stands if she wants to talk about it. I don’t believe that anyone’s so far beyond redemption. Lots of people are celebrating but I’m not. I have to talk about it because if I don’t people will speculate on what I think. It’s a sad, lonely sort of anticlimax. It’s really crap and I feel really bad it’s all ended up like this. I thought she’d just say sorry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb42c2592fd3dbc5c5fbc1f9af8e102047dec93/100_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14bfe8475079bcedc418731293b89d54","title":"paul weller webchat true meanings","story":"On the release of his 14th solo album, the folk-influenced True Meanings, the musician will be online to answer your questions from 12.15pm BST on Monday 17 SeptemberWhile his peers are often content with a life of nostalgia tours and reined-in expectation, Paul Weller continues to push his songwriting uphill.

But palm oil cultivation in south-east Asia is clearing forests and contributing to the decline of orangutans. Here are the key points Think back over the past week in your life. If you’ve applied lipstick, eaten toast or put on a load of washing, chances are, you’ve used a product containing palm oil. Indulged in ice-cream or washed your hair? Palm oil. According to the World Wildlife Fund: “It is in about half of all packaged products sold in the supermarket.” And it’s linked to the destruction of the rainforest and many of the species that reside in it.To stop palm oil being listed as “vegetable oil” or as one of a long list of hard to pronounce synonyms, an EU law was passed in 2014, stating that all food products containing palm oil should be labelled clearly. But the same cannot be said for cosmetics and household products in which palm oil is often used.Indonesia is home to some of the most bioerse areas in the world, including the Leuser ecosystem, the last place on Earth where Sumatran orangutans, elephants, tigers, rhinos and sun bears coexist naturally. The Tropical Heritage Rainforest of Sumatra – of which the Leuser ecosystem is a part – is a Unesco world heritage site, but it’s still in danger from palm oil plantations, pulp production and infrastructure projects. Orangutans are keystone species, which, according to National Geographic, means they help define entire ecosystems. If a keystone species – sea otters, elephants, honey bees, for example – disappears, no other species can fill its shoes, and the ecosystem changes irrevocably. Mainstream media now regularly covers palm oil, campaigns such as Say No to Palm Oil have sprung up and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil runs a certification system, which aims to ensure all palm oil with its stamp comes from sustainably managed plantations. Genuine change is yet to occur, however, prompting campaigners to put pressure on brands that use palm oil, urging them to use their power to genuinely reform their suppliers.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

We will bring that back from the EU negotiations and put that to parliament. I think that the alternative to that will be not having a deal.”The Chequers plan prompted the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson. May tried again to remake the case for it by claiming the other options put forward by the EU were unacceptable.“The European Union had basically put two offers on the table. Either the UK stays in the single market and the customs union – effectively in the EU – that would have betrayed the vote of the British people,” she said.“Or, on the other side, a basic free trade agreement but carving Northern Ireland out and effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the European Union and Great Britain out. That would have broken up the United Kingdom, or could have broken up the United Kingdom. Both of those were unacceptable to the UK.“We said ‘no’ … we’re going to put our own proposal forward and that’s what Chequers is about … It unblocked the negotiations.”May also dismissed a plan for the Irish border, including the one put forward last week by the Brexit-backing European Research Group.“What many of these other plans are based on is moving the border. You don’t solve the issue of no hard border by having a hard border 20km inside Northern Ireland, or 20km inside Ireland. It is still a hard border,” the prime minister said.“What we’ve done is listen to the people of Northern Ireland … They don’t want a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The only proposal that has been put forward that delivers on them not having that hard border, and ensures that we don’t carve up the United Kingdom, is the Chequers plan.”The prime minister again dodged the question of whether she believes in Brexit. “I believe that our best days are ahead of us,” she said.Asked what would happen if parliament rejected the deal she expects to secure with Brussels, May said: “Do you really think the European Union is going to give a better deal at that point?”In the full interview, to be broadcast on Panorama on Monday, May said she gets “irritated” by the debate about her leadership and criticised Johnson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587ba798de661ccd80889363b06b144edcdb4ece/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97db2d52e8fcd8d9d16bd4a0c13fd00c","title":"three quarters of labour delegates back reselection says momentum conference","story":"Grassroots group claims majority at party conference will support their proposalsMore than three-quarters of Labour delegates back Momentum proposals to make sitting MPs stand against rivals for reselection, plans that have caused some unease amongst senior Labour shadow ministers.The grassroots group said the vast majority of delegates attending next week’s Labour conference in Liverpool support their proposals for mandatory reselection, where MPs have to stand in open contests in order to run again for a seat, according to its polling.But senior Labour politicians are understood to be cautious about the proposals, including Jeremy Corbyn loyalists in the shadow cabinet.Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said it was a “difficult topic” and said the party should be “careful with proposals like this”.“We want it to be a democratic party, where members feel like they have their say,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live. “But the other side is if an MP had to go through a mandatory reselection process every three, four, five years, their attention would be drawn away from Westminster.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said he backs the current system of a trigger ballot – where MPs must lose the backing of local branches and affiliates before any reselection process is triggered.“I think that works quite effectively but that will be a debate – I can’t see it going through, but you never know on these occasions,” he said last week.Momentum argues that an “outdated rulebook” is holding back new members.The party’s national co-ordinator, Laura Parker, cited the example of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 28-year-old Democratic nominee for Congress, stating that if she “had been subject to Labour’s restrictive, outdated rules she would have been shut out”.“There is an overwhelming desire at the grassroots for a radical democratisation of our party and we ignore that desire at our peril,” Parker said. “If we can’t make democracy work in Labour, we can’t make it work in the rest of society, and we should start by getting our own house in order.“Measures to open up parliamentary selections, increase grassroots representation on the national executive committee and give members more of a say in leadership contests are supported by a vast majority of ordinary Labour members, and I hope NEC members will take note of this support when they meet on Tuesday.”Labour’s annual conference is likely to be dominated by debate on the party’s Brexit policy, after an unprecedented number of constituency groups submitted motions calling for the party to back a new referendum.Of the 272 motions being examined by the party’s conference arrangements committee on Monday, 151 are on the subject of Brexit.The majority call for the party to adopt a “people’s vote” on the final deal, with template motions drafted by a number of grassroots groups, including the leftwing Another Europe is Possible, Labour for a People’s Vote and the student group FFS (For our Future’s Sake).The sheer number of motions submitted will mean the party is all but bound to accept Brexit for a topic of debate at conference. Labour chiefs are expected to thrash out a compromise position when delegates meet on the Sunday night of conference to agree a composite motion, which is unlikely to expressly endorse a new poll but may keep such an option on the table.Michael Chessum, national organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said: “If we don’t have a manifesto commitment for a fresh referendum, we will end up going into an autumn election either promising a ‘bespoke Labour Brexit’, which we have no time to negotiate, or offering a Norway-style deal, which is straightforwardly worse than EU membership and will leave Corbyn with no seat at the European table.”Mike Buckley, who founded Labour for a People’s Vote, said it was astounding that almost a quarter of constituency parties had submitted motions calling for a new vote on the deal.“The Labour movement has shifted decisively against Brexit this summer – these motions follow the trade unions’ decision to oppose Brexit and support the principle of a final say,” he said.On Sunday, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said his party should support a vote on the final deal. “I don’t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people’s livelihoods,” he wrote in the Observer.However, the shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, argued that a fresh referendum would give May a lifeline. “Calling for a second referendum is really giving her a lifeline, because then she can say ‘Oh, if I can’t get it through parliament, I’ll go back to the people,’” he said.Labour would make a judgment later on whether to back any new poll, he said. “The reason we have not ruled anything out is because nobody knows what’s going to happen over the next few weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443cb0ff7b82a34cd808bac8e010a29a4ad5a19f/0_85_4334_2600/master/4334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5e6f46f11bad627b629f5afdc6fc077","title":"lewis hamilton wins singapore f1 grand prix","story":"In indomitable form, there is now a relentless, intimidating quality to Lewis Hamilton’s driving that seems to simply brook no dissent. His win at the Singapore Grand Prix was the culmination of a weekend when he put together moments of almost transcendent skill and a ruthless execution when it mattered that was untouchable.Reminiscent of Tiger Woods at his peak, Hamilton’s performance for Mercedes under the lights of Marina Bay looked a class apart from his rivals. So much so that he now has one hand on the title.Going into the meeting this was supposed to be Ferrari’s race. With his title rival Sebastian Vettel only able to finish in third behind the Red Bull of Max Verstappen, Hamilton leaves Singapore with a 40-point lead. Mercedes managed his race impeccably and Hamilton has now won four of the last five.Only six races remain, Ferrari have a mountain to climb and Vettel’s self‑flagellation and dissatisfaction with their strategy this weekend suggests they are reeling and have no answers to Hamilton’s performances. The British driver had nailed an extraordinary lap to take pole. The team principal, Toto Wolff, called it he best he had seen and with track position on the narrow street circuit paramount it was crucial. After holding first place into turn one, he was able to lead from the front, dictate what was ultimately an unspectacular race and maintain serene control for his 69th career victory. Yet given Ferrari’s form in Singapore it was still a win against the odds.Leaving with an even bigger advantage over Vettel had certainly not been what the team were anticipating. “Definitely didn’t expect to come to Singapore with 10 points more,” he said. “Definitely not. But I’m very grateful for those points and for all the hard work the team have put in.”Mercedes had indeed done a sterling job to produce a car that was more competitive at a circuit where they have traditionally struggled, as acknowledged by the technical director James Allison. “There has been a slow improvement of our performance,” he said. “We have been chipping away at it for 12 months and it is a delight. Lewis got the job done but we gave him a car he could do that with.”Vettel’s downcast demeanour in contrast reflected a Ferrari squad who were left wanting. They still have the quicker car yet are failing to exploit it and the German is becoming frustrated as the title looks to be slipping away. He was critical of their strategy in qualifying where he managed only third and then also of the race.He had passed Verstappen for second place on the opening lap but the team’s early pitstop in an attempt to undercut Hamilton did not pay off. He emerged behind a Force India and had fitted the ultrasoft tyres. Once Verstappen, who drove superbly for second, passed him through his pitstop, Vettel was on the wrong rubber and his challenge was effectively over.“With the way we raced today we didn’t have a chance.” Vettel said. “I said before the weekend we could only beat ourselves and I think today we didn’t get everything out of our package.“It was clear we were not fast enough in the race, we need to understand why. It’s largely due to how we decided to race and which tyres for how many laps. What we tried to do was get to first position and get ahead, but Lewis was too quick.”Vettel did insist that his team had done the right thing in going aggressive – they had been forced to by Hamilton’s qualifying lap – and insisted he would always “defend his team” but he will doubtless be requiring an extensive debrief in to just how the weekend got away from him.Hamilton, however, was on a roll of both confidence and momentum and was understandably optimistic that he is in a position to close out the title. “I’m really happy with it. Still lots of points available but with this performance, and this focus that we have as a team, I truly believe that we can deliver impactful weekends like this for the rest of the season. So that’s the goal.”Hamilton has signed a contract until the end of 2020 and last week suggested he was encouraged by the look of the proposed cars for 2021 to continue racing on after then. The victory has put him 22 behind Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 race wins. A fifth title already looks to be well within his grasp but after this weekend and on such form, even this once seemingly insurmountable target has begun to look achievable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8ee59c95939ca6418b85cad490c6c06dafdcbdb/0_77_4670_2802/master/4670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=604631d3e28532a67a9e0619cb6ab1f8","title":"rfu re introduce full time contracts england womens rugby union team","story":"The Rugby Football Union (RFU) has announced that it will re-introduce full-time contracts for the England women’s 15-a-side team from 1 January next year – having previously scrapped them in 2017.Under plans agreed upon at an RFU board meeting last week, 28 full-time contracts will be available, supplemented by seven further elite player squad agreements.“We are delighted to be able to offer full-time contracts to our 15s players,” said the RFU’s chief executive, Steve Brown. “This has long been our ambition and demonstrates the RFU’s commitment to growing the women’s game and the belief we have in the future of the sport.“We are at a tipping point for women’s rugby globally and it is our ambition to be world number one and drive growth at every level.

Eight grand tour wins later, out of a possible 18, with four different riders, British domination of this side of cycling now seems a given, in the same way that Quickstep Floors are expected to rule the roost in one‑day Classics.In winning the Vuelta by 1min 46sec from the surprise runner-up Enric Mas, Yates has finally confirmed the potential he showed back in 2011. It was a timely leap, as the next generation is waiting in the wings: the American Sepp Kuss, so strong in the first two weeks of his first grand tour, Spain’s Mas, the Colombians Miguel Ángel López and Egan Bernal.Realising potential is rarely as straightforward as a simple improvement graph may suggest, as many can testify, most recently Thibaut Pinot and Romain Bardet. In a three-week tour the transition from targeting a top-10 finish overall, and – as was Yates’s case – the young rider’s jersey to going full-on for an overall win is not to be underestimated. The priority ceases to be that of merely staying in touch but becomes a delicate balancing act: gaining time at key moments while not risking excessive loss, on any given day or in the days that lie ahead.In three months Yates has learned rapidly, given the contrast between the Giro d’Italia, where he signally failed to husband his resources, and the Vuelta, where he managed his strength perfectly for the final week. His ability to read a race and time his move was evident well before he turned professional in 2014 but he has added to that the ability to read himself and his body over three weeks.To achieve this he has had to curb and control the attacking instincts which have made him so exciting to watch over the last five years. “When I find myself on the defensive, it’s quite hard, mentally, to react to people,” he said on Saturday. “You never feel like you have the edge or you get the jump, or you surprise anyone. When you’re more aggressive, and you’re attacking, you get that little bit of momentum, you have that bit of a jump, that bit of surprise, and it makes a big difference.”Compared with this year’s British grand tour winners Froome and Geraint Thomas, Yates has youth on his side, at 26 to Thomas’s 32 and Froome’s 33. Whereas the Team Sky duo can hardly be expected to forge ahead physically now they are entering their mid-30s, Yates should have at least a couple of years before he reaches his potential in 2016 his manager, Matt White, said he expected Yates to improve for perhaps 10 more seasons. Of recent grand tour winners – Fabio Aru and Nairo Quintana, Froome, Tom Dumoulin, Thomas – he is the youngest racing.His Mitchelton-Scott team will also grow stronger the departure of the sprinter Caleb Ewan means they have completed the transition from a sprint and one-day-oriented team into one centred on the grand tours. They will never enjoy Team Sky’s budget, so are unlikely to afford stars such as Michal Kwiatkowski or – in the past – Mikel Landa to use as highly paid team helpers. They will have to keep on boxing clever, and the big test will come when they meet the likes of Dumoulin or Froome on a grand tour course that is less suited to the anarchic racing that marked the 2018 Vuelta.They do, however, have one key asset: Adam Yates. Mitchelton’s masterstroke in the Vuelta was a piece of resource management taken straight from the Team Sky copy-book: the younger Yates twin was allowed two weeks to ride himself into the race following his disappointing Tour de France, and came good just in time to step forward to support his brother in the final few mountain stages.This was the first time the twin double-act had been unleashed on a three-week tour and it worked every bit as well as their performances inidually since 2014 had suggested it would. It has been noted that since they turned professional one twin tends to match, and exceed, any given step ahead taken by the other if this trend is maintained Adam’s big leap forward cannot be far away.Whether or not Adam Yates matches Simon, there is still the prospect of the Bury twins, backed by an Australian squad that boxes clever, taking on Team Sky’s Froome and Thomas and their heavyweight team of all the talents, with Dumoulin and Primoz Roglic waiting in the wings. If it happens in the near future, it will be something to savour.Born 7 August 1992 in Bury, Greater\u0026nbspManchester.Nickname None, although “The Flying Black Pudding” has been suggested.

The red card shown to the lofty Will Spencer for a high hit on the smaller Tommy Taylor not only changed this game but prompted Leicester’s acting head coach Geordan Murphy to suggest intent should be factored into such judgments. “I’m not sure what players and coaches they’re consulting,” said Murphy. “It’s a gentleman’s sport isn’t it – you know if you deserve a red card, if you’ve done something to really break someone. Across the Premiership every week I see players being hit high and across the shoulder, swinging arms and seatbelt tackles that are sometimes refereed and sometimes aren’t. Consistency is key.” His Wasps’ opposite number Dai Young suspects there will be plenty of other similar incidents this season. “People are training throughout the week to tackle lower, but it’s not going to go away,” said Young. “These incidents are going to happen and unfortunately they will have bearings on games. I am sure there will be times this year when we don’t come out the right side of it.” Robert KitsonNot many sides could cope with losing two England back-rows as comfortably as Exeter made do without Sam Simmonds and Matt Kvesic – both ruled out through illness on Saturday morning – against Sale. It is a measure of the squad Rob Baxter has been compiling at Sandy Park that Sam Lonsdale and Tom Lawday, as comparatively unheralded as they may be, stood up to the task. There were also first starts of the season for the 21-year-old half‑backs Joe Simmonds and Jack Maunder, who was replaced by his 18-year-old brother, Sam, with five minutes remaining. As more clubs are increasingly willing to turn to young players this season – a result of slimmer squads brought about by salary increases – it would appear Exeter are benefiting from having already done so. Gerard MeagherWith eight minutes to go, Chris Cook ran clear to score what seemed at first to be Bath’s sixth try. Several metres behind him, Aled Brew ran a “support line”, which blocked the chasing Nathan Earle. First impressions were that it was fine – Earle was nowhere near and Brew can run in support if he wants. But Brew looked over his shoulder and changed his line according to where Earle was. By the end, the feeling was that Brew’s intervention was so unnecessary and annoying he deserved to be penalised, which he was after a review by the television match official. “He won’t be doing that again,” Todd Blackadder, the Bath director of rugby, said darkly. Michael AylwinThe Northampton crowd quickly took to the Australia wing Taqele Naiyaravoro on his club debut. Standing at a few feathers under 20st, with his first touch of the ball he barged through a challenge before an over-the-shoulder off-load and with his second left Alex Lewington sprawling before Billy Vunipola was dumped to the ground after giving what was by then a runaway dump truck his best shot. Otherwise, Naiyaravoro was unemployed as Northampton struggled to work the ball into space. The Saints’ director of rugby, Chris Boyd, does not want to use the second-heaviest player in his squad as a battering ram, preferring to have room so that he can keep moves alive. Change takes time, but there were signs of Boyd’s influence in Northampton’s first try. It came from a scrum and left the best defence in the league outwitted. The effort is there, but the difference with Saracens was their presence of mind in broken play. PRNew Zealand’s failure to attempt a drop goal in the final minute in Wellington that would have beaten South Africa highlights the declining value of the three points. Freddie Burns kicked the first in the Premiership for Bath on Saturday, one of only four players to kick one in the league last season. There have only been 16 drop goals kicked in the 190 Tests involving tier one nations since the last World Cup, but the drama of Jonny Sexton’s winning drop goal in Paris last February still resonates. Was Beauden Barrett watching?Exeter are at the top of the table after the opening three rounds having, like Saracens, harvested five points from their opening three matches. There is a touch of the All Blacks about the Chiefs, not so much in the way they play the game as in their obsession with tries rather than penalties. Their 16 kicks this season have all been conversions: 17 tries and no penalties. Seven trumps three.Cardiff Blues bubbled with optimism at the start of the season, but their opening three matches have all ended in defeat. They blew leads late on against Leinster, Treviso and Zebre to lose by one, two and two points respectively. They lost their first three last season, but recovered to win the European Challenge Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f56f1f3f72d659f60797c00b0ff8d305f989f7d5/0_78_2909_1746/master/2909.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38dc9649f8a687f29b21ec7a93e8bc07","title":"talking horses draw bias and the ayr gold cup","story":"It is natural to want to reduce a field of 25 sprint handicappers to something approaching a manageable shortlistThe Ayr Gold Cup – and its more recent siblings, the Silver and Bronze Gold Cups – are the feature races this coming weekend from a betting point of view, which means that, as ever, punters will invest considerable amounts of time, energy and ultimately money in trying to second-guess the effect of the draw.Invest?

What is more, this is a race where the draw has clearly had a significant effect in many renewals over the years, with the traditional wisdom being that high numbers have the edge in big-field sprints down Ayr’s straight five- and six-furlong track.\u0026nbspAfter all, it seems obvious if you look at a race like Regal Parade’s success on heavy ground a decade ago. Four of the first five home raced on the stands’ side, from stalls 20, 21, 26 and 24. Thanks to the clear draw advantage, those drawn low clearly stood no chance.\u0026nbspHold up, though. In the Ayr Silver Cup 24 hours earlier, also run on heavy ground and with an identical 27-strong field, it was the other way around. Four of the first five were from the other side of the track, in stalls 7, 1, 3 and 4. Did the draw bias change completely in the space of 24 hours?\u0026nbspTwo of the last five Ayr Gold Cup winners, meanwhile, have been drawn in stall 19. The other three were in eight, including Brando, who put up one of the great weight-carrying performances to win decisively in the most recent race, two years ago. And no one is suggesting that runners drawn outside these two stalls might as well stay at home.In fact, the low numbers held sway in all three of the big six-furlong handicaps in 2016, which is the most recent evidence we have. In both the Silver Cup and Gold Cup, though, pretty much the entire field gravitated towards the far rail following a Bronze Cup the previous day where the pace and serious competition was all on the far side and seven of the first eight were drawn in single figures. It may be that there was a bias towards the low numbers – or it could be jockeys’ groupthink after the Bronze Cup, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.It is all far more complex that “high or low”, in other words, and any actual advantage may become evidence only when the race has reached halfway and it is all too late.\u0026nbspThe location of the pace, though, is well worth a second glance, and Major Jumbo and Hey Jonesy – who are both, as it happens, trained by Kevin Ryan – could be two names to look out for. Major Jumbo was quick enough to lead a five-furlong handicap at Ascot in July, while Hey Jonesy did his best to match strides with Harry Angel through the first four furlongs of the Haydock Sprint Cup.\u0026nbspThe punting fare is pretty thin, even for a Monday, but Freebe Rocks (3.40) could be worth a small interest on one of the last cards of the year at Brighton. Michael Bell has two wins on his record and both were on the all-weather, but he ran well to finish third at Leicester last time out and is 1lb lower on a mark of 59. He raced off 73 on his latest start on an artificial surface so could have a very handy weight in a race that will not take much winning.\u0026nbspAndalusite was a ready winner at Brighton last time out but that was over seven furlongs and the drop back to six to contest the best race on the card may not be ideal. Wiley Post (4.10), a winner here over the extended five furlongs in August, could find it more to his liking, while Frantical (4.40) should also go well at the same meeting.\u0026nbspRebel Yeats (3.30) and Midnight Sapphire (4.20) look like the best bets on the jumps cards at Hexham and Worcester respectively, while Decoration of War (8.00) will take all the beating at Kempton.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/386a17b3c44028807f09bc70d43e68abcdabad51/995_610_2833_1700/master/2833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63a7eec4bf0fd18787bda5df92ad2f14","title":"ballets trockadero monte carlo review peacock london swan lake","story":"The Peacock, LondonIn their much-loved version, the company subtly point out ballet’s constraints on female dancers while preserving the magic of the storyFounded in 1974 and still going strong, the all-male Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo have become almost as classic as the ballets they perform. Their special mix of travesty, tribute and unselfconscious sincerity appeals to newbies and old hands, and is nowhere more balanced than in their much-loved version of Swan Lake act two.It features plenty of comedy: caricatures of ballet’s bearing and mannerisms mimed gesticulations like someone obsessively enunciating words in a foreign language cartoonish gurning timed precisely to the music pratfalls, missteps. Yet if the ballet’s airs are deflated and illusions unmasked, its magic remains. The deep myth of the story – prince, wizard, bird-woman – still speaks to our souls, Tchaikovsky’s music casts its spell, and the dancers, especially talented Carlos Hopuy as swan-maiden Odette, both lampoon and embody their roles.The Dying Swan solo, another Trocks perennial, allows each performer to take his own liberties with the part. Duane Gosa plays it hammy but not overcooked. His moulting swan keels over rather than milking its death scene. A black man as a white swan, Gosa (like the programme as a whole) also makes you notice that men in female roles are afforded liberties that are granted far less to women in ballet. There are more black faces here, and more body types.Food for thought, then, as well as entertainment. Yet there’s thinner nourishment in the ertissements that complete the programme. If the Harlequinade duet is a blithe showcase for show-off dancing (Long Zou in the female role, Takaomi Yoshino in the male), the faux exoticism of the Trovatiara quintet and the oompah kitsch of The Little Humpbacked Horse make them more surface than substance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a431f5bfbd11f7bbe18adff9c82dd5c13326ef63/35_562_4199_2520/master/4199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab15833f772135919d36accff0baec8b","title":"eastern star review burmese revolution 1988 uprising tara theatre london","story":"Tara theatre, LondonA survivor of the 1988 uprising meets the ex-reporter to whom he leaked information – for which action he was jailed – in this vital, fascinating dramaPlays in which two men seek the truth of a previous encounter are not uncommon. But one of the many differences between Michael Frayn’s Copenhagen and Guy Slater’s fascinating new play is that Eastern Star is based on verifiable testimony. It is, indeed, written with the support of a key participant, Christopher Gunness, who in 2013 returned to Myanmar to take part in a reunion for survivors of what was then Burma’s 1988 student revolution. Even if Slater’s play sometimes feels like a history lesson, it is one that tells a vitally important story.Going back to Myanmar, Gunness has a fraught encounter with a former friend, U Nay Min, in which the two men relive their pasts. In 1988, Gunness was a young BBC World Service reporter who was fed crucial information about the uprising against the military junta by U Nay Min, who had the code name Eastern Star. Where Gunness was acclaimed for his broadcasts and went on to enjoy a career as a UN diplomat, his Burmese source suffered 16 years of harsh imprisonment. What the play explores is not only Gunness’s survivor guilt, but his realisation of his role in U Nay Min’s incarceration.The device by which the two men excavate what took place for the benefit of a young relative of U Nay Min is a little awkward, but the drama touches on a wide range of issues: the responsibility of imperial Britain for Burma’s fate, the systematic erasure of the past by the country’s generals and the precarious nature of Myanmar’s supposed democracy under Aung San Suu Kyi, who emerged as a charismatic force during the student revolution. At its core, however, the play is about Gunness’s guilt and U Nay Min’s heroism and, in the author’s production, the two men are very well played. Michael Lumsden is all silvery anguish as the western visitor and David Yip captures precisely his old colleague’s mix of courtesy and anger. It’s a play that puts Myanmar’s current tragedy in context and that deserves to have a longer life on television or radio, for which it is ideally suited.

Should everyone just stop scrolling?When 24-year-old fashion blogger Scarlett Dixon posted a picture of herself having breakfast, the internet turned nasty. “The best of days start with a smile and positive thoughts. And pancakes. And strawberries. And bottomless tea,” Dixon wrote on her scarlettlondon Instagram feed, under an image of her looking flawless on a freshly made bed flanked by heart-shaped helium balloons.The sponsored post – for Listerine mouthwash, a bottle of which is visible on the side of the shot – was swiftly reposted on Twitter. “Fuck off this is anybody’s normal morning,” wrote Nathan from Cardiff. “Instagram is a ridiculous lie factory made to make us all feel inadequate.” His post, which has garnered more than 111,000 likes (22 times as many as Dixon’s original) and almost 25,000 retweets, prompted a wave of criticism, with the more printable comments ranging from “Fakelife!” and “Bunny-boiler” to “Let’s pop her balloons” and “Who keeps Listerine on their bedside table? Serial killers, that’s who.”That hostility feels par for the course on Twitter. The social network is a notorious hotbed of abusive strangers hurling abuse at other abusive strangers, who then all occasionally come together to bully a celebrity off the internet over some minor failing, such as being a woman in a Star Wars film. Instagram, by contrast, looks like the friendliest social network imaginable. It’s a visually led community where the primary method of interaction is double-tapping an image to like it, where posts that go viral tend to do so because of positivity rather than outrage and where many of the biggest accounts are famous dogs and cats. What’s not to like?But, for a growing number of users – and mental health experts – the very positivity of Instagram is precisely the problem. The site encourages its users to present an upbeat, attractive image that others may find at best misleading and at worse harmful. If Facebook demonstrates that everyone is boring and Twitter proves that everyone is awful, Instagram makes you worry that everyone is perfect – except you.In the days following her initial Instagram post, Dixon pointed out the irony that this fear – that the unreality of social media is harming people – was itself being used to justify the thousands attacking her.“Each time I refresh my page, hundreds of new nasty messages pour on to my Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, some of which have contained malicious death threats,” she wrote in a follow-up Instagram post, accompanying a picture of her in Venice with an ice-cream. “There are now hundreds of thousands of tweets circling the internet, shaming me.”“My feed isn’t a place of reality,” Dixon added. “I mean who spends their time in such a beautiful city, perched on a ledge, ice-cream in hand and smile permanently affixed to her face? It’s staged, guys.“I personally don’t think my content is harmful to young girls, but I do agree Instagram can present a false expectation for people to live up to.”But whether or not Dixon’s feed is harmful, there is growing support for the idea that Instagram isn’t great for its users’ mental health.In 2017, the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), an independent charity that seeks to improve people’s wellbeing, conducted a UK-wide survey of 14- to 24-year-olds, asking them about the big five social media platforms: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram. Users ranked how their use of the platforms affected everything from the quality of their sleep to their Fomo – the fear of missing out on what others are enjoying.Instagram came last, scoring particularly badly for its effects on sleep, body image and Fomo. Only Snapchat came close in its overall negativity, saved by a more positive effect on real-world relationships, while YouTube scored positively on almost every metric – except its effect on sleep, for which it was the worst of all the platforms.“On the face of it, Instagram can look very friendly,” says the RSPH’s Niamh McDade. “But that endless scrolling without much interaction doesn’t really lead to much of a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing. You also don’t really have control over what you’re seeing. And you quite often see images that claim to be showing you reality, yet aren’t. That’s especially damaging to young men and women.”The risk of developing an unhealthy body image is often highlighted, but McDade emphasises that this is just one aspect. “Some people may be looking at feeds full of cars, and it’s giving them anxiety and depression as they can’t afford them.”For Stephen, a 24-year-old from London, the unreality led him to develop unhealthy behaviours online. “I was going through a bit of heartbreak at the time,” he says, “and any experience of seeing my ex’s name on Instagram killed me. I was pretty down and found myself predominantly using Instagram to either ‘punish’ myself by looking at my ex, or using the browse feature to distract me. I found myself looking at attractive women a lot when they’d come up in the browse feature, which would then cause more to be shown.“The problem with Instagram is that you, almost exclusively, share content that is meant to reflect positively on yourself,” he says. “On Twitter or Facebook, you see much more content that isn’t, ‘Hey, look at my great life.’”Almost every user adds fuel to the flames. Even as we’re being made miserable by the unreal lives that we follow, we share an unreal version of our own lives. “I have been on Instagram since 2013 and in the beginning I enjoyed it,” says Adnan, a 25-year-old Syrian who lives in Cape Town. “But, as the years passed, it changed from being a friendly environment, where most people posted food pictures, into a competitive social platform where everyone filters out their lives to represent a life that does not exist. Nobody looks good all the time, nobody is always happy. When things get tough, I get really upset when I see other people having the ‘perfect’ life.” And yet, Adnan says, “I am also guilty of trying to show the best side of my life to people.”But Instagram has always been about looking flawless. What has changed to spark such a backlash? Among users I spoke to, one event was cited time and again: the introduction, in mid-2016, of Instagram’s algorithmic timeline. It was one of the largest changes to the platform since it was bought by Facebook in 2012. Rather than presenting users with a cross-section of what the people they were following were up to at any given moment, Instagram began populating feeds with the most noteworthy posts from those accounts, often reaching back days or even weeks to pull in particularly compelling content. In effect, the service began promoting a curated, unrealistic version of an already curated, unrealistic feed.Talya Stone, a parenting blogger at Motherhood: The Real Deal, went cool on Instagram shortly afterwards. “For a long time, Instagram was one of the only places where the interaction felt real,” she says. “Then the algorithm came along and blew that out of the water. The whole point of these social platforms is that they are supposed to enhance social connectivity – yet, bizarrely, they are based on an algorithm that seems to be working against this very notion.”Victoria Hui, who runs the lifestyle blog the Lust Listt, says there is another issue affecting “pro” Instagram users – those who make a living (or hope to) from advertising and sponsorship. “The new algorithm creates a popularity contest between creators, so that they resort to unethical business decisions in order to keep themselves at the top of the food chain.”Unscrupulous creators started buying followers, likes and comments in an attempt to fool the algorithm as Instagram clamped down on that, Hui says, those users formed secret “comment pods” conspiring to share “each and every post with each other in order to generate ‘authentic’ and immediate engagement”.While influencers such as Dixon often get the lion’s share of the blame for the epidemic of unreality on Instagram, it’s just as prevalent at the grassroots as it is among the “Insta-celebrities”.I stopped using the app earlier this year, when I realised that I reliably felt worse after opening it than I did before I started. But my Instagram – a locked account, with just a couple of hundred followers and posts – is almost exclusively for keeping in touch with people I got to know in other ways. The closest I get to following influencers is the pop star Carly Rae Jepsen and an Instagram-famous husky.Still, every time I open the app, I’m presented with an endless feed of my friends and family doing incredible things, having a wonderful time, without me.There’s the friend whose wedding I wasn’t invited to I found out about it through the app. There’s the friend who is looking fantastic after every workout and lets us all know. And there’s the friend who lives in New York, apparently over in London for the weekend without telling me.Meanwhile, I’m doing nothing of note – except sitting on Instagram. At least I don’t suffer the same from the adverts. Because of a glitch in my privacy settings, Instagram believes I am a Bangkok teenager and serves me nothing but adverts written in Thai for acne cures and KFC. This is not a joke.When I tell friends about my dissatisfaction with the app, their responses are mixed. Some cite conventional wisdom, telling me to unfollow the influencers with a commercial imperative to sell me a perfect life and devote the app to keeping up with the friends I care about. Rob, for instance, follows “fewer than 100 people, all family and friends”.But I don’t follow any influencers, and the friends I care about most are the ones most likely to create that familiar pang of Fomo.Others offer exactly the opposite advice, arguing that my problem is not following enough influencers. I should focus less on using Instagram to find out what people I care about are doing and more on using it as a source of information and inspiration. One friend, Lynsey, cites Present and Correct, which sells exquisitely designed office supplies, as her go-to happy place. Another, Marie, recommends her personal mix of “roughly one-third friends, one-third MPs and one-third drag queens”.It’s true that there is a whole world of information best communicated in a visual medium. While some fitness-focused Instagrams leave you feeling like a fat blob of plasticine, others are sources of useful advice, laser-targeted at people in your situation.But I’ve tried that version of Instagram, too, and I worry that it provides only a veneer of engagement, while forever hovering on the precipice of impossibly perfect breakfasts eaten by impossibly perfect people. Even Facebook, Instagram’s owner, warns against using its products in this way. “In general,” the company wrote on its corporate blog last year, “when people spend a lot of time passively consuming information – reading but not interacting with people – they report feeling worse afterward”.Of course, Facebook’s answer was that everyone should post more. But it would say that, wouldn’t it? Another option is to follow the guidance of the RSPH. As part of “scroll-free September” the charity is encouraging users to aim for anything between complete cold turkey and simply stopping at certain times, such as in the bedroom or during meals.There is one final possibility, proposed by a few others when I shared my own Insta-woes: don’t give up on Instagram, just give up on people.There are enough dogs, cats, birds, otters and ferrets to fill a social network of their own – from Jiro the otter to Gotcha the cockatoo – and it’s very hard to scroll through pet Instagram and feel bad about yourself.Though you may start wishing for a more photogenic labradoodle.For more information and advice on issues with social media, go to the RSPH: rsph.org.uk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cefd3a059cb09c629a09e2cc6e59c05a37b94ddf/0_284_3114_1869/master/3114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1ce58d31a3a21e22f42fc0e134a8e85","title":"locals guide to riga latvia 10 top tips biennale","story":"Small, green and beautiful, Riga is big on architectural styles, from art deco to rococo, and edgy art spaces that are currently hosting the city’s first biennale The family-owned Neiburgs design hotel is in a beautiful art deco building on acobbled street in Riga’s pretty old town.

And in any case a united Ireland was never going to happen.Until it was.These days you open a newspaper, turn on the television, perch on a bar stool and the topic bubbles up not as history but as a looming existential choice, the forsaken dream dusted off and glimmering as possible – even inevitable.“It’s like a ball or boulder coming down the hill. You can’t stop it,” said Osgur Breatnach, an author and political activist at a book-reading in south county Dublin. “Agree with it or not, it’s going to happen.”Drinkers in the Pádraig Pearse, an inner city pub and republican haunt named after one of the leaders of the 1916 Easter rising, cheered the prospect. “A united republic of Ireland – I’d love it,” said Jamie Dean, 60, a labourer. “We’d be the same country. Not the Brits. It’s ours. So simple.”It’s not simple.Northern Ireland Unionists and Protestants who consider themselves British recoil at the idea of a United Ireland. Plenty of Catholics north and south have their own reservations, not least the financial cost, adding up to a fraught, complex tangle of identity, ideology and economics.But a confluence of events has shunted unification on to the political agenda.A plan unveiled last week by the European Research Group – the hard Brexit faction of the Conservative party – failed to assuage anxiety over whether a hard or soft border will descend on the porous 310-mile boundary of fields, roads and towns.Being bounced out of the EU to an uncertain fate has prompted one in six Northern Ireland voters to switch allegiance, delivering a majority for unification, according to a recent poll. “The possibility is no longer a pipe dream,” said Tommy McKearney, 66, a former IRA member and hunger striker. “I don’t think it’s imminent. It’ll be over the next 20 to 30 years – in a lifetime, but not in my lifetime.”“It’s a massive demographic shift. In five to 10 years there’ll be a Catholic majority in Northern Ireland,” said Peter Shirlow, director of the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Irish Studies. It will take longer for those numbers to translate into the electorate. “But a majority for a united Ireland is going to happen, no doubt about that.”Some unionists are overturning taboos by openly questioning the endurance and even desirability of the union with Britain.The “battle for the union is on”, Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland’s former first minister, and former leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, recently warned. Unionists need to prepare for a border poll, he said: “I don’t expect my own house to burn down, but I still insure it because it could happen.” Unionists, in other words, need to act before the demographic clock ticks to midnight by selling the union’s merits to moderate nationalists and those who consider themselves neither unionist nor nationalist. Brexit, and unionist clumsiness in wooing allies, may immolate such insurance.A trickle of other prominent unionists such as Alex Kane, Mike Nesbitt and Jim Dornan have joined Robinson in sounding the alarm.Under the Good Friday agreement, the Northern Ireland secretary should call a border poll if he or she thinks a majority would vote for unification.The current secretary, Karen Bradley, did not help the union’s case this month by admitting that when appointed to the job she was “slightly scared” of Northern Ireland and profoundly ignorant about its political isions.Reaction on the streets of Belfast was scornful. “The government in Westminster doesn’t give a damn about us,” said Tom Neill, 72, a former soldier. “We’re a stepping stone here, politicians drop in, then leave,” said Anthony Quinn, 55, a film location manager.A spate of anniversaries underscores a sense that eras end, new ones begin, history advances. It is 20 years since the Good Friday agreement cemented republican and loyalist ceasefires with a power-sharing government in Stormont. Next year it is 50 years since the Troubles erupted, three decades of strife which claimed more than 3,500 lives.Further back, in October it will be 700 years since Edward Bruce, the last high king of Ireland, was defeated at the battle of Faughart and had his head delivered to King Edward II, marking an end to efforts to unite Gaelic Ireland.When British royals visit Ireland these days they receive hugs. The rebellious colony of uprisings, famine and resentment is now a prosperous, confident republic which no longer defines its identity in opposition to Britishness. Adoring crowds mobbed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in Dublin in July, a sequel to the Queen’s groundbreaking visit in 2011. Pope Francis, in contrast, spent much of his visit last month apologising for clerical sex abuse.All changed, changed utterly, as Yeats said.A country once viewed as an economic basket case and Catholic theocracy is now the EU’s star performer and a secular, progressive beacon with a gay taoiseach, marriage equality and relaxed abortion laws.In the Pádraig Pearse pub you still find a gate from Kilmainham jail, in honour of the 1916 rebels executed in the prison, but this part of Dublin is transformed, with dank slums giving way to sleek apartments and cafes serving organic avocado toast to Facebook and Google employees.The republic’s new Garda commissioner is Drew Harris, OBE, a veteran of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and its predecessor, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which republicans branded a unionist jackboot. The switch in allegiance stirred little controversy.Nor is there any outcry over Fianna Fail, one of the Republic’s biggest political parties, preparing to become an all-Ireland party by absorbing the SDLP, the north’s moderate nationalist party.Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA during the Troubles, is pushing for a border poll while trying to ease the sting for unionists. A draft document entitled Irish Unity – An Activist’s Guide floats changing the Irish flag and anthem. The party’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, has suggested rejoining the Commonwealth.Meanwhile her predecessor, Gerry Adams, a bogeyman for unionists, is cultivating a quirkier persona. His latest initiative: a cookery book with recipes which sustained republicans during marathon peace negotiations. The puns have flowed: “give peas a chance”, “shinner of beef”, “when hunger strikes”.Unity is coming, said Danny Morrison, a writer and former IRA member and Sinn Fein publicity director. “In socioeconomic terms it makes sense. A majority is emerging that will favour radical change.”Unionists – if they engaged – could shape the process from a position of strength, he said: “They’re not under duress, they’re not being bombed into it by the IRA.” The new dispensation could be fluid for instance, an interim phase could keep Stormont and not force unionists to sit in a Dublin parliament.Unionists with business, farming and fishing interests would be pragmatic if a united Ireland was the only way to remain in the EU, said Morrison. “They’re willing to adapt to that,” he said.All-Ireland sports act as a bridge, especially when teams do well, such as last month when the women’s hockey team advanced to the World Cup finals, casting a feelgood glow over the whole island.“It’s now an evidence-based proposition,” said Kevin Meagher, a former Labour adviser on Northern Irelandand author of A United Ireland: Why Unification is Inevitable and How it Will Come About. “There’s a very good utilitarian argument. And it’s now harder to rally against the south as a bogeyman.” British politics will not lament Northern Ireland’s exit from the UK, said Meaghar: “There will be an audible sigh of relief.” It could all add up to a new era – an island re-united belting out Four Green Fields, the folk song about a lost province. But this scenario has a problem.“It’s a load of steaming bollocks. The Orangemen, for starters, won’t be budging.” The speaker is a plasterer called Michael, sipping cider in the Pádraig Pearse.Many agree with this assessment, albeit with less colourful language. A chorus of politicians, academics, pollsters and even republicans say Brexit’s impact on unionism is overstated and that a united Ireland will not happen soon, if ever.One reason is the estimated £10bn annual subvention from London to Belfast. Dublin cannot match this. Unification would in all probability mean slashing public sector jobs and services in the north and hiking taxes in the south, incentives for voters on both sides of the border to vote no.Analysts question the methodology of polls which rely on online panels and show a spike in support for unification. “Most people here take them with a grain of salt,” said Duncan Morrow, an Ulster University professor. Younger unionists may sigh at DUP fulminations against gay marriage and abortion rights, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they wish to join their socially liberal neighbour, he said.For all the Republic’s current progressive sheen, unionists are wary of a neighbour which kowtowed to Catholic bishops and marginalised its Protestant minority. “We were kept very quiet and almost disappeared,” said Robin Bury, author of Buried Lives: the Protestants of Southern Ireland. “There is still Anglophobia here, it’s still in the bloodstream. Unionist unease is justified,” he said.Ian Marshall, an anti-Brexit northern unionist and farmer, has good things to say about the Republic. The Irish government and Sinn Fein supported his election to the Seanad, Dublin’s upper chamber. Yet Marshall warns unification could create a “bloodbath” if loyalists feel alienated or pressured: “We could potentially turn the tap on again, and that fills me with horror.”Edward Burke, a terrorism expert at Nottingham University, echoed that concern, saying loyalist paramilitaries focused on criminal enterprises could revert to “Pavlovian instincts” of sectarian killing.“Tiocfaidh ár lá,” goes the republican slogan. Our day will come. An expression of longing masquerading as prophecy. Maybe it will come. But Ireland’s dreamers will need to be patient. And careful what they wish for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7416eee729fafab4940b54d0bff40d96ae6dc55/511_596_7483_4490/master/7483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd68b25cef8bb4e113f61bad116dd9d6","title":"china accuses sweden of violating human rights over treatment of tourists","story":"Beijing demands an apology over ‘brutal abuse’ of three Chinese tourists by police in StockholmA disagreement between Chinese tourists and a hostel in Stockholm over check-in time has turned into a diplomatic spat between China and Sweden, after Beijing criticised Sweden for violating the human rights of Chinese citizens.China has demanded an apology from Sweden and issued a safety alert for its tourists in the country after it said that three tourists had been “brutally abused” by Swedish police on 2 September.The Zengs, a family of three had arrived at a hostel in Stockholm around midnight, hours before their booking. They were allowed to wait in the lobby until the staff ordered them to leave and police forcibly ejected them.Bizarre video footage posted online shows police carrying the group outside, while the son yells in English: “This is killing. This is killing.” Another clip shows the three lyingon the ground crying loudly while the mother wails in Chinese: “Save me.”The Chinese embassy in Sweden said on Saturday that China’s ministry of foreign affairs and the embassy had “made solemn representations” to the Swedish government “stressing that what the police had done severely endangered the life and violated the basic human rights of the Chinese citizens.”The incident comes as ties between China and Sweden have come under pressure. The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who Beijing considers a violent separatist, visited Sweden last week, and China continues to hold Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen and book publisher, in custody.News of the altercation has attracted widespread attention in China where the search term “Chinese tourists mistreated by Swedish police” has received more than 130m views and 85,000 posts on the microblog Weibo. Discussion of the incident has turned into a debate about the behaviour of Chinese tourists at home and abroad.“This is shameful. The image of China has been disgraced in the hands of these people,” one Weibo user wrote. “The Dalai Lama visits Sweden and the foreign ministry uses this incident as a pretext to make a fuss. That’s more embarrassing than the performance of this family,” another wrote.“These people feel the world should move around them, if not, then they lie down on ground and scream for help,” one commentator wrote in an essay posted on WeChat.Zeng told the Global Times he had asked the hostel to let his parents, who are elderly with health problems, stay until their room was available. The staff refused and called police to remove them.“I broke down and lost my mind,” Zeng said. “I was not able to think whether it is was appropriate or not. I just wanted to denounce the police and seek help from pedestrians.”A manager at the hostel told Swedish newspaper, Aftonbladet, the family had arrived the day before their booking and refused to leave. The hostel said staff called police sometime after midnight, when the tourists began to make verbal threats.“We only know that we have done everything we could do for this guest, but at the same time we can not accept that our staff are exposed to threats and that other guests will suffer from a threatening situation,” the hostel manager said, according to Aftonbladet.Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82759a4f111eeeb51a2095eb474f58f4a3e61cbc/0_161_3990_2395/master/3990.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fac860008fce3243693f51a44a43f80","title":"lisbon museum plan stirs debate over portugals colonial past","story":"‘Museum of the Discoveries’ would glorify slavery and other historical abuses, critics sayA campaign pledge to build a museum in Lisbon dedicated to Portugal’s colonial history has sparked a debate over Portuguese national identity, the nature of historical memory and the question of collective guilt.The controversy centres on the so-called Age of the Discoveries – the period starting in the 15th century when expeditions by Portuguese navigators helped the country lay claim to territories stretching from Asia to South America.The period is widely regarded as both the apex of Portuguese history and the bedrock of national identity. But a growing chorus of critics has begun to question it, drawing attention to the crimes committed in the service of Portugal’s colonial project.The current row has its origins in last year’s mayoral campaign, when Lisbon’s incumbent mayor, the socialist Fernando Medina, drew up a list of 25 tasks he hoped to accomplish if re-elected. The list included the idea of building what was initially dubbed the Museum of the Discoveries. The document provided few specifics, giving neither the location nor exact content of the future museum and saying only that the space was to cover the “most and least positive aspects” of the Age of the Discoveries and “include an area dedicated to the topic of slavery”.The proposal went largely unnoticed until April, when more than 100 Portuguese and international academics released an open letter criticising the proposed name as an “obsolete, incorrect expression, filled with wrong-headed meanings”.That letter, which appeared in the Expresso weekly, opened the floodgates for a slew of opinion pieces and TV roundtable debates, with participants coming out for and against both the proposed name and also the very principle of such a museum.“It would only reinforce Portuguese colonial ideology, which portrays that period as heroic and simply glosses over the glaring issues of slavery, mass killings and other abuses,” said Joacine Katar-Moreira, a researcher at the University Institute of Lisbon and co-author of an open letter criticising the proposal that was signed by 100 black activists. “There are already so many statues and monuments paying homage to that moment in history. We don’t need another one, which, like the others, would be an instrument for stroking national self-esteem.”Katar-Moreira and other activists would like to see funds earmarked for the museum put instead towards a monument honouring the victims of slavery.Portugal was the leading player in the Atlantic slave trade, its galleons thought to have transported nearly half of the total 12.5 million enslaved Africans. (The British were a distant second, trading 3.2 million people.) Portugal has, however, long cast itself as the “bom colonizador”, or good coloniser, citing the fact that inter-racial relationships flourished in Brazil and Cape Verde as proof that its colonial practices were somehow “softer” than those of other European powers.Historical evidence refutes such a reading – a point stressed by those who oppose the proposed museum. Other commentators have bristled at the suggestion that Portugal has anything to be ashamed of.“It’s not possible to erase history,” the columnist João André Costa wrote last month in Público newspaper. “It happened. It existed. We can’t go back in time … and we don’t have anything to beat ourselves up about, kneeling for 100 years, with downcast eyes and hearts.”Even the prime minister, António Costa, whose family has its origins in Goa, Portugal’s former colony in India, weighed into the debate. He said in a recent interview: “We mustn’t have a complex, but rather pride in being able to deal, in Portugal, with that period in history when we undoubtedly made our biggest contribution to the world.”The Lisbon authorities have maintained a low profile throughout the debate, except, according to local media reports, to float potential alternative names, said to include the Museum of the Discovery – without the plural – Museum of the Expansion and Voyage Museum. Requests for an interview with Medina went unanswered.With the fate of the museum still unclear, the argument looks likely to continue, stoking a debate many regard as long overdue.“I think it’s a useful debate but I think it needs to happen in a measured way, and not harden into the extreme positions we’ve seen on both sides,” said the director of Público, Manuel Carvalho, who in June wrote an opinion piece entitled The Heavy Burden of Being Portuguese.“I’m completely in favour of us talking about the dark side of the Age of the Discoveries, about the things that weren’t taught to us in school, where we only heard about the heroic side. But you can’t demand a society to change overnight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f65953f5835ca554f0f22776ff535e0151351cb/706_1065_3189_1914/master/3189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaf6a44b08807fa0ce5b3d73e31d8856","title":"monday briefing 40 think multiculturalism undermines british culture","story":"This is Alison Rourke bringing you Monday’s top stories.Novichok all-clear – Police gave the all-clear in Salisbury overnight after two people were taken ill in a restaurant. The major incident was stood down after fears of a third exposure to novichock were proved to be unfounded. A cordon had been set up around the Prezzo Italian restaurant close to where the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal collapsed after being poisoned with the nerve agent. Meanwhile, the MoD has announced it is to introduce robots and drones to investigate chemical attacks to avoid exposing emergency workers to dangerous chemicals. A trial involving scientists from the military research unit Porton Down took place at the Fire Service College in Gloucestershire, including a drone that can relay 3D images and detect chemical agents using a laser system.Labour MP selections – More than three-quarters of Labour delegates back Momentum proposals to make sitting MPs stand against rivals for reselection. The grassroots group said the vast majority of delegates attending next week’s Labour conference in Liverpool support their proposal for MPs to have to stand in open contests in order to run again for a seat. But senior Labour politicians, including Jeremy Corbyn loyalists in the shadow cabinet, are understood to be cautious about the proposals.Predicting child abuse – Vast quantities of data on hundreds of thousands of people is being used to construct computer models in an effort to predict child abuse and intervene before it can happen, the  has learned. Amid mounting financial pressure, local councils are developing “predictive analytics” systems to algorithmically identify families for attention from child services, allowing them to focus resources more effectively. Critics say it’s likely to be hugely controversial due to its potential to intrude into inidual privacy and there are fears it could risk accidentally incorporating and perpetuating discrimination against minorities.Flooding fallout – Seventeen people are now known to have died in the US in chaos caused by former hurricane Florence, while the now tropical storm Mangkhut killed four in China, after 64 people lost their lives in the Philippines. Catastrophic flooding in North Carolina prompted the mayor of Fayetteville, Mitch Colvin, to tell reporters “the worst is yet to come” as the state’s governor, Roy Cooper, said Florence had “never been more dangerous than it is now”. Meanwhile, Mangkhut battered the heavily populated Guangdong region, having skirted Hong Kong by just 62 miles. China Central Television said the former typhoon triggered storm surges as high as 3 metres. In the Philippines, dozens of people, mostly small-scale miners and their families, are feared to have been trapped by a landslide in Itogon, 300km north of Manila.Tale of five squirrels – A wildlife centre in the US state of Wisconsin has faced the unusual task of having to untangle the tails of five baby squirrels, which had become entwined with each other and parts of their nest. “You can imagine how wiggly and unruly (and nippy!) this frightened, distressed ball of squirrelly energy was, so our first step was to anaesthetise all five of them at the same time,” the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre at the Wisconsin Humane Society wrote on its Facebook page. With the animals sedated, the centre worked to unravel the “Gordian Knot” of tightly tangled tails and nest material. All five recovered and will be looking for acorns in the near future.The aim of the study, Mehta says, was not to prove or disprove the validity of a month-long abstention, but to show the relationship between alcohol and serious health markers. The government doesn’t advise taking a month off alcohol, favouring instead having alcohol-free days every week. What no one has studied yet though is whether this approach would lead to the same up-front health gains as a month off. “You could postulate,” says Mehta, “that we think that one of the ways alcohol causes damage is by making the gut a bit leaky, allowing bacterial proteins (not whole bacteria) to get through and cause low-level inflammation in the body. Giving up for a few days may improve that, but it’s a bit speculative as to the long-term effects.” Common sense dictates that the ideal plan would be to do Go Sober for October and then introduce weekly booze-free days when you are back on the wagon.

He sent Maria and her family to a visiting government outreach clinic at the top of the hill.Nurses used a colour-coded tag to measure Maria’s middle upper arm circumference (Muac) and see if it was thick enough for her age. Green is good, yellow is concerning.Her parents, Veronica Sequira and Quintino Tilman, were referred to a health post in Zumalai but they could not afford the transport to get there.“But then World Vision staff told us we had to refer her now, we had to find it,” Tilman says. “We realised this was serious.”Maria recovered and now she, her family and Bere are sitting with  Australia outside their small house in a village in the Covalima mountains, bordering Indonesian West Timor. Maria is quiet and clings to her mother, who speaks quietly.Smoke curls through the trees, and chickens, dogs and pigs roam freely and scratch in the damp earth. From a concrete open hall on the hill crest, the screams of children receiving vaccinations can be heard. The outreach clinic is visiting again.Sequira, who says she used to eat very little herself, gave birth to Maria at home and did not know how much she weighed but believed she was big.In villages where every child is underweight, a child like Maria might not seem so bad but the colour-coded tape gives an unequivocal diagnosis of malnutrition.Bere, a volunteer health worker affiliated with the government, has been trained and assisted by World Vision’s aid program, partly funded by the Australian government, which also provides medical resources to clinics.His job starts with “mapping” communities, identifying vulnerable families and malnourished children and referring them to medical care.As we talk, Maria’s siblings wander in and out, carrying plates of food that aid workers, including the visiting World Vision Australian chief executive, Claire Rogers, happily note contain a number of the superfoods pushed by their nutrition programs.Maria recovered quickly but it is possible she’s still been affected by the severe malnourishment at such a young age.In this country, which emerged from violent occupation less than two decades ago, and which is a little over an hour’s flight from Australia, other children are dying of malnutrition.It is not exclusively due to a lack of food but rather a combination of factors: poverty, lack of nutritional education, poor health literacy and sanitation, as well as strong beliefs in spiritual medicine. Disabilities go undetected and untreated.The signs of international aid groups and programs are scattered across the countryside, filling in where the Timor-Leste government cannot.Malnutrition in Timor-Leste has led to one of the highest rates of stunting in the world. It is getting better, slowly, but according to a government health survey in 2016, about half of all children under five show stunting, more frequently and more severely among the poorest families.About eight in 10 Timorese people depend on subsistence food production and much of the land is arable, but an extraordinary number of people do not know what to grow or eat.Covalima is one of four districts targeted by the Better Food Better Health program, run by World Vision and funded partly by the Australian government and which focuses on increasing nutrition and sustainable nutrition-based agriculture, assisting 31,000 people so far.They all push hard on “superfoods” – eggs, soybeans, green leafy moringa, red kidney beans, orange sweet potato – to replace the rice and porridge-heavy diets of the rural areas. In many areas, moringa is considered animal feed or used in death rituals, and not known to be edible.“I think the most exciting thing for me was seeing one of the older sisters come out with the food that we’d just been talking about on a plate,” Rogers tells  Australia after visiting Maria. “Seeing that kind of behavioural change, and so quickly in the two to three months we’ve been working with them, is pretty profound.“They’ve been moving away from deeply entrenched attitudes about what foods are appropriate.”Across the districts, local people are increasingly growing their own more nutritious food, processing soybeans into tofu and tempeh, and running parent support groups, farming collectives, cooking classes and local savings and loans groups.Economic development specialists are being recruited, to help people connect to markets when they start to have excess product.More than 120 of the government health workers have received training and “incentive packages” of a chicken coop and chickens from World Vision, which are also given to vulnerable families.Navalia, 12, is a bright and happy girl, and she grins and giggles when asked about her toys and complimented on her dress.Her disability suggests cerebral palsy but her parents don’t know because she has never been diagnosed. They once went to a government department to ask for disability support but were told she could only access it once she was an adult.“No one cared about us, so we just left it,” says Ilario Magno, Navalia’s father and a teacher who would desperately like his daughter to go to school.There is a disability trained teacher at the nearby school but the barrier is safe transport.In another village, Eduardo Barreto, 11, does go to school, where he enjoys mathematics and dreams of becoming a parliamentarian. But it takes him an hour to walk the couple of kilometres and is extremely painful, as he hobbles without shoes and with one deformed foot.“We discouraged him from school but he wanted to go,” says his mother Teresa Vincen.Like Navalia, their attempts to get government assistance were rebuffed.In a meeting with local staff, Rogers recalls Eduardo’s story and reminds them that children are at the heart of their work, and if there’s some extra way to help – transport assistance for example – they should do it.At a parents club in Alieu, the instructions are basic boil water before consuming it, wash hands before eating, breastfeed babies and feed children healthy food.The top three causes of malnutrition in the Covalima region are disease, food insecurity and poor nutritional knowledge, says Rui Amaral, a nurse and director of the Zumalai community health centre, which cares for around 16,000 people across eight villages.He has noticed more referrals of children with malnutrition, which he attributes to greater health awareness, but the cases are often serious and sometimes fatal.Dr Genunia Alfonso Da Silva treats between one and three children for malnutrition each week, usually between 10 months and three years of age.They often present with respiratory problems and sometimes the family has avoided medical care or spent their money on animals to sacrifice in traditional ceremonies instead of nutritious food.“They believe their child is sick or malnourished because of a curse on the family or some spirit is angry, so they’ll try to fix it with traditional medicine,” Da Silva says.“Shortness of breath is considered in villages to be a traditional disease healed by, for example, lime or lemon on the chest, or betel nut leaves with lime and spit on the chest.Da Silva says attitudes are shifting, as people realise the clinic has healed sick children after traditional medicine did not work.Timor-Leste has made strides since independence, and is routinely praised for its commitment to human rights and democracy, but its people remain largely poor and struggling.Serious economic troubles take much of the government’s focus and international aid is an obvious and heavy presence.There are multiple compounding factors of poverty to deal with, not least a lack of government assistance.Amelia Da Cruz, who has lost two of the four children she has given birth to since she was 15, says access to healthcare remains a concern – many people can’t get to hospital and the outreach clinic does not come to her village.But Da Cruz says the all-female farmers group she leads has been transformative for the community.“I’ve seen many changes after we were taught about nutritious food,” she says. “I feel it’s not a lot of work because we are united.” traveled to Timor-Leste with World Vision"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae2f152eb96f25849c630f940eec4e6debe65a66/0_0_4588_3156/master/4588.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9e5a8d587e85bbdff8e6945354bf42e9 960w","title":"typhoon mangkhut in pictures","story":"The strongest tropical storm of the year lashes the Philippines and now heads towards China’s southern coast"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3625831.1536683327!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is ireland a better place to live now than 20 years ago","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Dublin Port Tunnel: it erts thousands of trucks every day from Dublin city centre Do you think Ireland today is a better place to live than the Ireland of 20 years ago? That was the question Pricewatch asked of Twitter users last Saturday night.We asked it because sometimes reading commentators – professional and otherwise, across all media platforms – you would be forgiven for thinking that things have taken a dramatic turn for the worse in recent years, with vast swathes of society thrown under the bus in the name of progress.By some accounts the late 1990s was a magical time when all was well with our world in terms of healthcare, housing and happiness. Or at least more was well with it than is the case today.But Pricewatch well remembers the 1990s, and it was a long, long way from amazing. By almost every measure Ireland today is a more inclusive, progressive and safer place to live than it once was, and the oppressive control exerted by church and State have been dramatically lessened. People live longer, cars are safer, roads are better, homes – if you are lucky enough to have one – are warmer and food is better and cheaper than it was.All told, our Twitter poll attracted 3,344 votes in just 24 hours. While it was neither scientific or representative it was interesting all the same, and suggested that a significant majority believe things are better now than they once were, with 64 per cent voting yes and 36 per cent rejecting the notion.When we were done with the polling we turned our attention to ways things have improved and ways things have worsened. Here are just some of those ways in absolutely no particular order.Plus: A couple of weeks ago both the north- and south-bound lanes of the Dublin Port Tunnel – it runs under the city from close to the airport to the docks down by what was once known as the Point Depot – were closed after a truck shed its load. Within an hour the city centre was gridlocked as hundreds of articulated lorries – erted from their usual underground route – made their presence known along the quays. It brought back memories of Dublin in the rare auld times when such gridlock was a daily occurrence and heavy goods vehicles were an ugly – and sometimes a lethal – menace. The motorways that snake their way across the State have also made travel faster and safer.Plus: Supermarkets in the 1990s were drab and dull, own-brand products were revolting, and there was literally no chance you would ever find some class of weird flamethrower kit for sale in the middle aisle. Everything started changing in 1998 when Lidl moved into the Irish market. A year later do did Aldi. Growth was slow in the early days as a distrustful nation proved reluctant to swap the branded products they had been reared on for unfamiliar labels. Yet the discounters stuck with it, and built better relationships with Irish suppliers and we are the better for it. Today more than 20 per cent of shoppers go through their doors regularly, and while they are not without their critics they have saved us a lot of money.Plus: Online booking was a thing of the future in the late 1990s and cheap travel was a Superbus to London. Flights to London from Ireland cost £200 (or €450 in today’s money) compared to less than a tenner now. We were under the thumb of travel agents, and had to rely on tiny thumbnail pics in glossy brochures to make our holiday decisions. Today online booking platforms, Trip Advisor and Airbnb have given budget-conscious consumers enormous control of travel plans and prices have tumbled as a result.Minus: More than 10,000 people are homeless. and almost 150,00 children are living in poverty.Minus: A recent Daft.ie report found that average rent in the Republic is €1,304, which is over €560 higher than in 2011 and more than 26 per cent higher than the high point during the Celtic Tiger years. Rents grew by 12.4 per cent in the year to June as stock remains the lowest on record. In Dublin rents are 34 per cent, or almost €500 a month, higher than the previous high. While figures from the Residential Tenancies Board are less gloomy, showing average rents nationally at €1,060 per month, up by just over 7 per cent year-on-year and €1,527 in Dublin, up 7.7 per cent year-on-year, they are still incredibly bleak.Minus: Airbnb might be great for finding holiday homes on the cheap but it is exacerbating the rental and homelessness crisis. The company recorded 640,000 “guest” stays in Ireland during the summer, which it said would bring in about €57 million to the Irish economy. But with so many properties across Ireland, especially in urban areas, used exclusively for short-term Airbnb rentals, medium and long-term renters are struggling to get a look-in. How bad is it? Very bad. According to daft.ie more than half of the available rental properties in Dublin are being listed as short-term tourist lets. In May the site said it had 1,258 properties available for long-term rental. On the same day, the independent monitoring website Inside Airbnb showed the stock of Dublin properties to let on Airbnb from professional listers, as opposed to people temporarily renting their own homes, stood at 1,419. The Government has promised to introduce some kind of regulation or licensing of short-term renting – such as via Airbnb. Cities such as Berlin and Amsterdam already limit the amount of time for which properties can be rented on such short-term arrangements.Plus: All told, 89 per cent of the Irish population now have access to broadband, with the vast majority using smartphones to go online, according to recent figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO). While the number of households with an high-speed internet connection is unchanged from 2017, it is a 17 per cent jump since 2010 and a jump of around 100 per cent since 1998. When asked what they do online most people say they use the internet for finding information on goods and services, followed by email and reading or downloading online news and accessing social networks. Weirdly, no one in Ireland is looking at pornography, at least according to the CSO figures.Plus: With Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Netflix, NowTV, Amazon Prime, Audible, legally grey set-top boxes and plain illegal downloads at our fingertips, we have never had so much music, films, television and literature available to us at such a low cost.Plus: Everything from concert tickets and holidays to clothes and food can now be bought in the virtual space. Irish people spent over €5 billion online in 2017, with the spending set to grow to €14 billion by 2021. The choices available to consumers are unparalleled. And the value to be found can be amazing. The ability to take our business elsewhere has also put manners on many retailers who were happy enough to gouge Irish consumers in the past. Not only can things frequently be bought for less online, consumers who shop online have considerably more rights when it comes to returns than those who conduct their business offline.Minus: Of the €5 billion Irish consumers spent online last year, €3 billion was spent overseas. Overseas websites do not employ Irish people, they do not pay taxes here and they contribute nothing to local communities. They also put huge pressure on actual bricks and mortar retailers in the Republic, and if current trends continue more such retailers will have to shut up shop, which could turn our town centres into wastelands.Plus: The popularity of cycling has surged over the last decade and the number of commuting cyclists in Dublin has more than doubled since 2006. That was the year they were at their lowest level since city officials started recording data in 1980 The numbers on their bikes in 2006 was 4,839 compared with 12,447 last year, up 3 per cent on 2016 figures. The numbers in private cars fell 3 per cent last year, according to the National Transport Authority and Dublin City Council’s annual traffic count. The figures also showed that more commuters were using public transport and other “sustainable” transport modes – cycling and walking – than any time since the records began, with a total of 70 per cent of all inbound trips crossing the canal made by sustainable transport. This compared to 61 per cent in 2006.Plus: Public transport-use in Dublin has reached a record level with more than half of all city commuters using buses, trams or trains last year, the highest proportion since records began 40 years ago, and since 2006 car-usage has declined by almost 20 per cent. The Leap card which integrated all public transport has certainly made commuting life easier for people who would rather leave their cars at home.Minus: While many people have managed to escape from the economic calamity that was brought upon us by banks and policy-makers more than a decade ago, many more remain mired in the debt swamp. Tens of thousands of people are in long-term mortgage arrears and continue to be harassed by banks who are unwilling to cut them any slack. The banks are, however, willing to flog many of the most distressed loans at massive discounts to so called “vulture funds”. Last May, David Hall of the Irish Mortgage Holders’ Organisation warned that a “tsunami is coming” with 17,000 mortgage holders vulnerable to having their homes repossessed because of the intransigence of banks and the “cancer” of vulture funds.Minus: A report, released by the Department of Finance last week, projected huge increases in age-related costs in the absence of major policy changes and talk of a pension timebomb grows louder and louder. Rising life expectancy, greater numbers of older people and a fall in the rate of economic growth mean total age-related expenditure will increase significantly and could lead to a rocketing of Ireland’s national debt. It is estimated that just 35 per cent of private sector workers have made any financial provision for their retirement and the rest are relying on the State pension which will involve a dramatic fall in their standard of living when they stop working.Plus: On the plus side people are living longer and healthier lives than at any time in our history, so that has to be a good thing, right?I think the Ireland we love went when the banks took over and put these pawns in place. Leo, Coveney and all that lot. Paul CallianLads, when you look back nostalgia takes over, for all Ireland’s modern day problems (and there will always be problems) we are no longer beholden to the church, the Troubles are gone \u0026amp we are a progressive nation...we just need a new impetus in politics,something fresh and new. Diarmuid McCarthyPeople don’t talk anymore and don’t live beyond their phones, also people get offended to easy. I miss Sundays when everything was closed and you just hang out with family. Slow down and take off the blinkers. Peter Phillips8th repealed, gay marriage, church in retreat, more heterogeneous society, Dublin turning into a real European capital, better infrastructure, awesome hurling, great coffee, superb food. Sean FinlayToo much stress and pressures on people now than ever. People lead superficial lives and social media has a lot to answer for the pressure. Sadly suicide is the highest killer in Ireland today. Better yes in some ways, but I think it’s a lonely place too. Johanna WhyteNo, people cared more for each other, community meant more. Ciaran GogginsNo, it feels more unsafe for some reason, higher crime, city less safe to walk around. Maybe it was because I was young \u0026amp naive. Olga CarryOn the whole it’s better, we still have poverty and inequality and gobshite politicians, but nothing quite as bad as the pre-millennium was, but give it time. Paul BissettWe’re wealthier, more liberal and church influence has declined significantly, housing is better, technology has made our live easier. Proinsias O FoghlúIt is much better in many ways, more modern, nicer food, better coffee, but I can’t afford to live here any more. The rent takes up nearly all my income. Roos DemolI think it’s mainly better because of better technology. Nothing to do with how the country operates. Hospital crisis, homeless crisis, so-called middle and lower class incomes being squeezed into poverty. Colleges fees, national debt, corruption. I’m sure most of this was here before but nowhere on this dreadful scale. Imagine selling extremely badly needed potential social housing but selling them on the cheap to foreign interests at a cost to a taxpayer and then buying them back at a profit to the foreign interest and at a further cost to people. Eugene Mc HughIt’s worse, the people have changed, there’s a feeling of hostility around. No one is allowed to be in the middle, you have to be completely left wing or right wing, and then we have housing, healthcare, banking, crime. Anna JoyceNo....20 years ago I was just out of uni, working, renting and saving with a realistic chance of buying my own house. Didn’t have to go through teen years with cyber bullying, unrealistic insta expectations of what life should be etc. Would not want to be 20 something nowadays. Olivia KingToo few characters to reply but I’ll try: free third level education – didn’t exist when I went to college, I got the grant. Without it I would never ever had had a third level experience. Virtually full employment – I took me 18 months of looking to get my first part-time job. Greater availability of opportunity, greater awareness...I think it’s a pretty good time to be alive. I’m much happier raising my two girls today than if I’d had to do it 20 years ago. I’m 41.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe 2018 National Ploughing Champions kick off this week in Tullamore, Co Offaly, with an estimated 291,500 visitors expected to attend the three day event. The championships, which run from September 18th to 20th in Screggan, will include more than 300 competitors with some 1,700 vendors exhibiting their products at stalls around the site. President Michael D Higgins will formally open the 87th National Ploughing Championships on Tuesday, an event he previously described as “the most beloved rendez-vous in Ireland’s rural calendar”. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will attend Europe’s largest outdoor event on Wednesday along with Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys. Minister for Foreign affairs Charlie Flanagan will attend the event on Thursday. Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed is also expected to attend. Tickets for the ploughing championships can be purchased upon arrival. Adult tickets cost €20 each while senior citizensstudents cost €15. Children under 12 go free when accompanied by an adult. The main exhibition area at the championships will be open from 9am-6pm each day while the ploughing competitions run from 10.30am-2.30pm. There will be three fashion shows running at 11.30am, 1.30pm and 3.30pm each day of the festival. Highlights over the three days will include sheep shearing, live tractor build, sheep dog trials, loy digging, the meggars competition and the national brown bread baking event. There will also be a junior baking event and funfair for children. Former Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry will be attending the ploughing championships on Wednesday, September 19th, as a guest judge at the National Dairy Council’s afternoon tea competition. She will sample the baking expertise of three finalists – a home economics teacher, a cardiac physiologist and IT specialist – who will present their cakes to Ms Berry for her assessment. The Department of Foreign affairs has invited visitors to stop by the DFA stand where they can learn about Ireland’s work in the EU, the Irish Aid programme, the consular and passport service and Ireland’s trading relationships overseas. Visitors will be able to apply for a passport direct from the Ploughing with free digital passport photographs available, while there will also be a special section with information on preparations for Brexit. The stand will also mark 25 years of diplomatic relations between Ireland and South Africa. Visitors are advised to travel to the championships by train and walk the 10 minutes from Tullamore train station to the site where a shuttle bus will drop you at the entrance gate. The shuttle bus costs €5 child return, €9 adult return and €20 family return (two adults and max three children).Drivers should factor in at least double the normal journey time due to heavy volumes of traffic. Gardaí have designated eight colour-coded routes to help visitors get to and from the championships. Those travelling northbound on the N8 from CorkMunster should exit at junction 6 and proceed towards Screggan. Visitors on this route will park in the designated blue car parks on the left and right hand sides beside the event grounds.Traffic coming from the south east should travel along the N77 via Durrow and Abbeyleix before arriving in Portlaoise. From there vehicles will be directed through Clonminham, onto the N80 towards Mountmellick and through Rosenallis and Clonaslee. Visitors on this route will park in the designated grey car parks. Traffic coming from the south east will take the N80 towards Portlaoise and will be designated the yellow car park beside the grounds at Screggan. Traffic from Limerick, Kerry and the southwest should take Junction 26 on the M7 and proceed towards Borrisokane and on to Cloghan where they will park in the brown car park.Traffic from Dublin will be designated to the purple car park and traffic from the north will go in the pink car park. The Green car park will cater to visitors from western counties and the orange car park will hold spaces for vehicles travelling from Kildare. There will be wheelchairdisability parking spaces allocated in all car parks as close to the event entrances as possible. Bus parking facilities will also be provided at the event. The site of the ploughing championships is 110km from Dublin, 210km from Cork, 272km from Belfast and 163km from Rosslare. Visitors are also advised to dress appropriately (ie warmly!) for the event and to wear suitable footwear for rough terrain. They can also download the ploughing app for live event and traffic updates. Wet and windy weather is expected to hit the country over the coming days as the downgraded tropical storm Helene crosses over Ireland. Tuesday will begin with sunny spells but rain will extend across the country throughout the afternoon. It will become blustery with moderate to fresh and gusty winds and temperatures of 17 to 20 degrees.Wednesday morning will be wet and windy however the rain is expected to clear through the afternoon. Thursday will be wet for most of the day with the heaviest rain in the south and the east."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Top Irish colleges say changes are needed if they are to compete with Europe\u0026rsquos bestClose to 300,000 expected to attend over three-day eventArtist says process to gain nomination is so flawed you might as well \u0026lsquorip up Constitution\u0026rsquoHopefull Presidential candidates have been speaking at public council meetingsDaughters tell congregation it is impossible to condense father\u0026rsquos life into just a few wordsFormer Tory minister claims protocol used to coerce UK into \u0026lsquovassal state of Brussels\u0026rsquoArticle 43 of Constitution \u0026lsquokey impediment\u0026rsquo to local authorities easing housing crisisWet winter and dry summer leaves many dairy and beef farmers low on fodder reservesThe \u0026euro38m system which came into operation in July 2015 saw a code assigned to all residences and businesses in the StateSurgeon carries out transplant in Temple Street hospital after training in USVoluntary providers could receive court orders if they continue with current practicesHeavy rain forecast in parts of country as Met \u0026Eacuteireann warns of possible spot floodingTeaching initiative endeavours to ersify what is a \u0026lsquowhite, middle-class\u0026rsquo professionPlan aims to boost number of French, German, Spanish, Italian and Russian educatorsRuling of unconstitutionality affects nearly 100 patients held in mental health facilitiesOne garda involved in policing housing protest referred to on Facebook as \u0026lsquodog\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoscum\u0026rsquoCase reports highlight difficulties of finding suitable placements for children in careGarda management considering proposals in Deloitte analysis on workplace practicesDepartment briefings raise fears asylum applicants may have to present as homeless\u0026lsquoDistance selling\u0026rsquo alcohol to minors almost impossible to police, says report"},{"url":null,"title":"typhoon mangkhut lashes the philippines with 200km h winds","story":"  September 15, 2018Relief as casualties far lower than officials feared storm heads towards southern China   September 16, 2018More than 2.4 million people evacuated in southern China\u0026rsquos Guangdong province "},{"url":null,"title":"locals begin to deal with the aftermath of storm florence","story":"  September 15, 2018America Letter: Entrenched views on climate change and bad laws are reaping a whirlwind   September 15, 2018National Hurricane Center says storm will dump 30 to 40 inches of rain on Carolinas   September 15, 2018Monitors as far away as Nigeria searching for calls for help and posting on rescue databases "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

We want everyone to travel safely, so the advice is - stay safe, stay back.Highways England has launched a campaign named Don\u0027t Be A Space Invader, which is based on the popular arcade game.The campaign is supported by Formula 1 world champion Nigel Mansell, who described tailgating as a driving habit I utterly deplore.Tobias Ellwood ordered to stop CPR on Pc Keith Palmer by doctor, Westminster terror inquest hearsSquirrels separated by vets after tails become entangled with strips of plastic wasteBiological terrorism: how vulnerable is the UK?Duchess of Sussex announces first solo project - a cookbook in support of Grenfell survivorsThe ’s proud history of Spitfire pilots – in obituariesIt\u0026#39s Chequers or no deal, says Theresa May, as Boris Johnson warns Brexit will be \u0026#39total write-off\u0026#39 unless she ditches Irish backstopComment: My fellow MEPs postured over Viktor Orbán, but effective action needs a sound legal basis Comment: We must clamp down on the social media giants that allow online harms against childrenJustice will \u0026#39catch up with\u0026#39 Burma generals, warns UN expert ahead of release of Rohingya reportUncovered: the surprising secret of Queen\u0026#39s Cape Town speechPanic in Salisbury restaurant as diners fall ill: Police rule out Novichok linkHalf a million pensions ‘out of poverty’ overnightZoe Ball set to replace Chris Evans on Radio 2 breakfast showBodyguard theories: who\u0026#39s behind the conspiracy? Soon-Yi Previn defends her husband Woody Allen and accuses Mia Farrow of abuseNicola Sturgeon urged to apologise over £30 billion North Sea oil \u0026#39lie\u0026#39 four years on from indy referendumComment: Hockney is accomplished, but to call him \u0026#39venerable\u0026#39 is a corruption of EnglishTyphoon Mangkhut lashes China and Hong Kong after killing 65 in the Philippines Social media firms face £18m fines if they send children notifications at night\u0026#39Risk to life from storm Florence is rising\u0026#39, with water levels expected to peak on MondayWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/17/TELEMMGLPICT000174817544_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgfFSEfhKCOzpqkDFnZiLxXDG3AIdHql2HsITcXthp-Y.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"tobias ellwood mp ordered stop cpr pc keith palmer refused give","story":"Tobias Ellwood MP had to be told to stop trying to save Pc Keith Palmer\u0026#39s life after Westminster terror attack MP Tobias Ellwood had to be ordered to stop giving CPR by a doctor because he refused to give up on saving the life of Pc Keith Palmer after the Westminster terror attack. Khalid Masood, 52, killed Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, when he ploughed an SUV into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before stabbing Pc Palmer to death at the gates to the Palace of Westminster.When it became clear that Pc Palmer would not survive, Mr Ellwood, who had been assisting with first aid, told a doctor present you\u0027re going to have to order me to stop.The medic said: Sir, you\u0027ve done your best but you do need to stop.He described the eerie silence at the Palace of Westminster as it stayed in lockdown in the aftermath of the carnage.Mr Ellwood and one other person were left with the officer\u0027s body.He said: We both covered the body as best we could, closed the eyes and I said I\u0027m sorry.It was very very silent, it was a very strange end to a very traumatic four or five minutes, to suddenly be left completely alone with just one other person.The Conservative MP also ignored fears of a second terror attack as he helped give first aid to a stabbed police officer in the wake of the atrocity.Tobias Ellwood arrives at the Westminster terror attack inquestThe former soldier told the inquests into the victims\u0027 deaths that despite the risk that attacker Masood may have had a bomb in his abandoned car, his main concern was giving help to stricken PC Keith Palmer.Mr Ellwood told the Old Bailey: My brother was killed in a secondary attack in Bali... so I was very aware of that.I was concerned about what would happen if things were to ratchet up, but my immediate concern was that we had somebody who was clearly badly bleeding and needed assistance.82 seconds of hell | How the terror attack unfolded across Westminster BridgeMr Ellwood told the Old Bailey be believes members of the public should step forward in the face of terrorist atrocities.I know the official advice is to step back, report it. I find myself countering that somewhat, because if more of us do step forward as we saw in the Manchester attack, London Bridge and Westminster Bridge as well, the message gets through that no terrorist is going to win.If the Houses of Parliament become a tower of protection, it will change the face of what Parliament is about, he said.Before the attack, there had at times been less firearms protection at the site than he would have liked, the Old Bailey heard, but now the level of security we have in place, I\u0027m not sure we could do more, he said.Squirrels separated by vets

evidence","story":"Created with Sketch.Research suggests that tiny particles of carbon could potentially pass to unborn babiesClick to followThe IndependentThe study has led to calls for stricter ‘clean air’ policies to reduce the impact of pollution on healthEvidence that air pollution passes from pregnant women’s lungs to the placenta has been found for the first time, according to a new UK study.Researchers detected what they believe are tiny particles of carbon, typically created by burning fossil fuels, after five non-smoking mothers living in London underwent planned caesarean section births.\u0026nbspThe study adds to existing evidence on the dangers of pollution for unborn babies and suggests that when pregnant women breathe polluted air, sooty particles are able to reach the placenta via the bloodstream.Air pollution now ‘biggest environmental risk in Europe’Air pollution ‘causing major reduction in intelligence’Even ‘safe’ air pollution levels can harm your heart, study warnsGirl’s death first to be linked to illegal levels of air pollutionPrevious research has indicated links between pregnant mothers’ exposure to air pollution and premature birth, low birth weight, infant mortality and childhood respiratory problems.Dr Lisa Miyashita, who worked on the study at Queen Mary University of London, said: “Until now, there has been very little evidence that inhaled particles get into the blood from the lung.“We’ve known for a while that air pollution affects foetal development and can continue to affect babies after birth and throughout their lives.“We were interested to see if these effects could be due to pollution particles moving from the mother’s lungs to the placenta.”The study was presented by Dr Miyashita, a post doctoral researcher, and Dr Norrice Liu, a paediatrician and clinical research fellow, at the European Respiratory Society International Congress on Sunday.All five of the women gave birth to a health baby at the Royal London Hospital after an uncomplicated pregnancy and gave permission for their placentas to be studied after delivery.The researchers studied cells called placental macrophages, which are part of the body’s immune system and work by engulfing harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles, and help to protect the foetus.A high-powered microscope was used to look for small black areas that researchers believe were carbon particles.Out of a total of 3,500 placental macrophage cells, 60\u0026nbspcontained 72 small black areas between them.On average, each placenta contained around five square micrometres of this black substance.Tiny carbon particles were also found on a more detailed study of two placentas using an electron microscope.“We were not sure if we were going to find any particles and if we did find them, we were only expecting to find a small number of placental macrophages that contain these sooty particles,” said Dr Liu.“This is because most of them should be engulfed by macrophages within the airways, particularly the bigger particles, and only a minority of small sized particles would move into the circulation.“Our results provide the first evidence that inhaled pollution particles can move from the lungs into the circulation and then to the placenta.“We do not know whether the particles we found could also move across into the foetus, but our evidence suggests that this is indeed possible.“We also know that the particles do not need to get into the baby’s body to have an adverse effect, because if they have an effect on the placenta, this will have a direct impact on the foetus.”The study has led to calls for stricter “clean air” policies to reduce the impact of pollution on health.The worst countries in the world for air pollution deaths610 Bosnia and Herzegovina610 Bosnia and Herzegovina“Previous research shows that pregnant women living in polluted cities are more prone to pregnancy issues such as restricted foetal growth, premature birth and low birth weight babies,” said Professor Mina Gaga, president of the European Respiratory Society, which\u0026nbspwas not involved in the study.“This new research suggests a possible mechanism of how babies are affected by pollution while being theoretically protected in the womb.“This should raise awareness amongst clinicians and the public regarding the harmful effects of air pollution in pregnant women.“We need stricter policies for cleaner air to reduce the impact of pollution on health worldwide because we are already seeing a new population of young adults with health issues.”A recent study found that air pollution from cars and vans racks up health bills of nearly £6bn every year in the UK.Queen Mary University of LondonEnter your email addressFill out this

It still leaves a whole host of questions.AURA has been cooperating with an on-going law enforcement investigation of criminal activity that occurred at Sacramento Peak, it said, in reference to the hill where part of the observatory is located. During this time, we became concerned that a suspect in the investigation potentially posed a threat to the safety of local staff and residents. For this reason, AURA temporarily vacated the facility and ceased science activities at this location.It said that the unexplained threat was enough to force it to evacuate staff, because they couldn\u0027t be protected otherwise.The decision to vacate was based on the logistical challenges associated with protecting personnel at such a remote location, and the need for expeditious response to the potential threat, it continued.\u0026nbspAURA determined that moving the small number of on-site staff and residents off the mountain was the most prudent and effective action to ensure their safety.Astronomers at the facility will now be able to go back to their work, and people kicked out of their homes during the shutdown will be allowed to return. But there will continue to be substantial amounts of security as that return happens, it said.Given the significant amount of publicity the temporary closure has generated, and the consequent expectation of an unusual number of visitors to the site, we are temporarily engaging a security service while the facility returns to a normal working environment.And it also made clear that it was aware the silence and mystery around events had helped add to that speculation. But it said that it had no other choice.We recognise that the lack of communications while the facility was vacated was concerning and frustrating for some. However, our desire to provide additional information had to be balanced against the risk that, if spread at the time, the news would alert the suspect and impede the law enforcement investigation. That was a risk we could not take.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/11/15/protests.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/11/15/protests.jpg","title":"brexit sadiq khan eu referendum final say second vote","story":"Created with Sketch.Mayor of London’s demands come ahead of Labour’s annual conference next week, with over 100 anti-Brexit motions submittedClick to followThe IndependentRelated: Chuka Umunna and John Rentoul debate the possibility of another Brexit referendumLondon mayor Sadiq Khan calls for second EU referendum: \u0027the people must get a final say\u0027One of Labour’s most powerful figures, Sadiq Khan, has called for the British public to be given a fresh vote on membership of the European Union.\u0026nbspThe demand from the mayor of London comes as he insists that there are now just two possible outcomes for Britain in the negotiations with Brussels – either a bad deal, or a no-deal scenario.\u0026nbsp“After careful consideration, I’ve decided the people must get a final say. This means a public vote on any deal or a vote on a no deal, alongside the option of staying in the EU,” Mr Khan wrote in an article for The Observer.\u0026nbspThe Independent has already launched its own campaign for a fresh vote on the final deal, with over 800,000 iniduals signing a petition for a Final Say.Mr Khan, who has previously flirted with the prospect of a second vote, added that another public vote was “never inevitable” or “something I ever thought I’d have to call for”.\u0026nbsp“But the government’s abject failure – and the huge risk we face of a bad deal or a ‘no-deal’ Brexit – means that giving people a fresh say is now the right – and only – approach left for our country,” he said.\u0026nbspHis remarks will likely mount pressure on Jeremy Corbyn, ahead of Labour’s annual conference next week, with over 100 anti-Brexit motions submitted, including calls for a fresh vote on the final deal.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn himself has repeatedly failed to rule out the prospect of a second vote, but has consistently said it is not party policy and Labour is not advocating the issue.\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchOne of this frontbenchers, Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has also suggested that another vote on EU membership could result in civil disobedience and social disruption.\u0026nbspThe intervention from Mr Khan also coincided with an article from Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who said that Labour would vote down any attempts to force the country into a “blind Brexit”.\u0026nbspHe said Theresa May must reach his party’s key Brexit tests for a deal with the EU, including delivering the “exact same benefits” as the UK currently has as a member of the single market and customs union, to secure Labour’s backing for her deal.\u0026nbspIn a letter to the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, Sir Keir added: “But, let me be equally clear: a vague political declaration would not meet those tests. Labour will not – and cannot – vote for a blind Brexit.”\u0026nbspLast week, it emerged that Mr Khan would\u0026nbspbe Labour’s candidate in the 2020 mayoral race after securing enough support from within the party.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/24/22/tian-tian.jpg","title":"edinburgh zoo giant pandas breeding programme hi vis vests interserve","story":"Created with Sketch.Staff told to stop wearing fluorescent clothing \u0027in order not to upset the animals\u0027Click to followThe IndependentTian Tian has not yet become pregnant despite a five-year breeding programmeAfter five years of disappointment in Edinburgh Zoo’s giant panda breeding programme, efforts are underway to make the rare bears’ home a little more romantic.Staff and contractors have been told not to wear high-visibility clothing over reported concerns that garish garments may deter Tian Tian and Yang Guang from mating.The two pandas have been on loan from China since 2011 but have yet to produce any cubs since arriving in Scotland.Earlier this year the zoo announced it had halted the breeding programme so it could “further assess the incredibly complex and unpredictable” process.Enhancements are also being made to the enclosure which houses the pandas, which will return to China in three years.As part of efforts to put the zoo’s animals at ease, a contractor which provides cleaning, security and waste disposal services on the 82-acre site has told its employees to ditch their brightly coloured vests.Interserve, which has worked for the zoo since 2013, said staff would avoid “wearing high-visibility clothing in certain areas in order not to upset the animals”.Tian Tian and Yang Guang, the UK’s only giant pandas, and two Asiatic lions are among the animals said to be put off by the fluorescent clothing.The changes were agreed as part of the company’s five-year, £2m contract renewal with the zoo.The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), which runs the zoo, did not respond to a request for further information. But a spokesman told The Sunday Times: “Animals can be sensitive to noise, vibrations and anything visual which may be out of the ordinary, such as high-visibility clothing. Our staff and contractors follow procedures to ensure the impact of on-site activities is minimal.UK news in picturesMayor of London Sadiq Khan has announced his support for a second Brexit referendum.

It was announced her contract with the Mail Online “was not renewed by mutual consent” last November. This came months after Hopkins agreed to leave her job as a host on LBC radio in May last year after she tweeted a call for a “final solution” to Islamist terrorism in the wake of the Manchester arena attack.\u0026nbspShe left The Sun in 2015 after writing a column that compared migrants to “cockroaches” and ”feral humans” and said they were “spreading like the norovirus”. The Devon-born columnist became the subject of a petition calling for her to be sacked.Hopkins now works for far-right Canadian website The Rebel Media, where Tommy Robinson, the former English Defence League leader, was previously\u0026nbspa contributor.\u0026nbspMonroe, who is from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex and identifies as non-binary, announced Hopkins had entered into an IVA on Twitter.“I can confirm today that following that landmark libel case, Katie Hopkins has entered into an IVA to avoid bankruptcy,” the food writer tweeted.“I knew for a while but could not say anything for legal reasons. The arbitrary defender of free speech didn’t want anyone to know, ironically...”“...I have been paid in full, but many of her creditors, including my lawyer, will not be paid what they are owed. For the want of an apology, a house, a job, a column, a radio show, and now financial solvency, were lost. It’s all very sad, actually.”She continued: “I’m not cruel nor celebrating – that case cost me 18 months of sanity and work, and I think neither of us wanted it to turn out this way. (I can recommend an excellent budget cookery book or three, for getting back on your feet, though)”.Monroe initially asked for Hopkins to apologise and donate £5,000 to a migrants’ charity,\u0026nbspsaying that otherwise she would sue.\u0026nbspHowever,\u0026nbspHopkins did not retreat, prompting the expensive court action.After Monroe tweeted about the solvency agreement, social media users honed in on a tweet fired off from Hopkins’ account back in 2014 suggesting people in debt tended to blame others for their plight rather than taking personal responsibility.Hopkins – who was refused permission to appeal in the legal battle in January – was forced to cover the complete costs of the libel case. This included £24,000 in damages to Monroe and £107,000 to her lawyers.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log in"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/29/17/brexit-so-far.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/29/17/brexit-so-far.jpg","title":"brexit michael gove chequers no deal plan theresa may brussels","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027There\u0027s one critical thing, a future prime minister could always choose to alter the relationship between Britain and the European Union\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsMichael Gove says future PM could change Theresa May\u0027s deal after BrexitMichael Gove has said Theresa May’s Chequers blueprint for Brexit is the “right one for now” but that a future prime minister could alter the UK-EU relationship if they desired.\u0026nbspThe environment secretary – one of the most prominent Leave campaigners during the referendum – gave his lukewarm backing for Ms May’s plan as he admitted he himself had “compromised”.\u0026nbspBut speaking on Sunday, he refused to say whether the plans thrashed out by the prime minister and agreed by cabinet would be “permanent” and said her successor would have the ability to change it.It comes as the prime minister faces escalating pressure from members of her party to ditch the blueprint that is despised by dozens of hard\u0026nbspBrexiteers, or face a challenge to her leadership.\u0026nbspAsked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show whether the prime minister’s Chequers plan for Brexit was a “temporary” or “permanent” solution, Mr Gove replied: “I think it’s the right solution for our country to leave the European Union on the basis of what we’ve negotiated, and I think it’s absolutely right because we would be outside the single market, we would be outside the customs union.\u0026nbspPressed again, he added: “No, I think it’s the right answer. But, there’s one critical thing, a future prime minister could always choose to alter the relationship between Britain and the European Union, but the Chequers approach is the right one for now as we’ve got to make sure we respect that vote and take advantage of the opportunities of being outside the EU.”\u0026nbspDuring the appearance, Mr Gove also urged Brussels to compromise in the negotiations. “I’ve compromised,” he said. “I’ve been quite clear that some of the things that I argued for in the referendum passionately, as a result of Chequers I have to qualify one or two of my views.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUworkers sorting radishes on a production line at a farm in Norfolk.

They will remove decent, middle-class thinkers out of the Labour party. They’ll just get rid of them in favour of communists.”Elsewhere in the new interview, the 78-year-old weighed in on a string of current political issues, lavishing praise on Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg as “the best parliamentarian” he had seen but “the wrong man” to succeed Theresa May as party leader.UK news in picturesMayor of London Sadiq Khan has announced his support for a second Brexit referendum.

asking the party’s annual conference to back either a general election or a fresh public vote on the final Brexit deal.It comes after one of Labour’s most powerful figures, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, called for another\u0026nbspvote on Brexit, insisting there are now just two possible outcomes for the UK in the negotiations – either a bad deal, or a no-deal.\u0026nbspIt is likely to pile

Labour’s position on Brexit, with other issues including the party’s stance on antisemitism, welfare, government contracts and schools.On Monday, the party’s conference arrangement committee will sift through the raw motions and decide which ones to put forward to Labour’s conference in Liverpool next week.Each Constituency Labour Party (CLP) has the opportunity to propose a “contemporary motion” for discussion at conference and campaigners for a new public vote claim the number of motions supporting the idea will dominate.One motion from Camberwell and Peckham, the constituency of the party’s former deputy leader, Harriet Harman, notes the “Chequers deal is dead” and calls for both a meaningful vote in Parliament and UK-wide referendum on the final terms of Brexit.\u0026nbspA substantial amount of the motions, however, are based on the left-wing statement backed by Another Europe is Possible and Labour for a People’s Vote.\u0026nbspAs well as calling for a fresh vote, it also says Labour should “form a radical government – taxing the rich to fund better public services, expanding common ownership, abolishing anti-union laws and engaging in massive public investment”.\u0026nbspOne of the national organisers at Another Europe is Possible, Michael Chessum, said: “If we don’t have a manifesto commitment for a fresh referendum, we will end up going into an autumn election either promising a ‘bespoke Labour Brexit’ which we have no time to negotiate, or offering a Norway-style deal which is straightforwardly worse than EU membership and will leave Corbyn with no seat at the European table.“Of the options, soft Brexit is the least popular with the electorate,” he added.\u0026nbspBrexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative

It\u0027s critically important that we realise this. There was a vote in the European Parliament but it\u0027s a longstanding principle of a number of MEPs from different countries and different parties not to believe that the European Parliament should interfere in or censure the internal democracy of a particular country.”\u0026nbspHe told the programme that he did not believe that “inidual criticisms of the kind you are understandably tempting me to make necessarily help us in ensuring we get both solidarity on the issues that count and the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU”.“My view is, the British are traditionally accused of playing ide and rule and picking off inidual countries - but I\u0027m not going down the route, I have views... but I\u0027m not going to be drawn on my views about inidual European leaders. ”UK news in picturesMayor of London Sadiq Khan has announced his support for a second Brexit referendum.

Turkey\u0026nbsphas amassed armoured vehicles, artillery guns, and tanks along the border with Syria, with some equipment moving across the frontier, according to Turkish news outlets and video footage posted to the internet.It has transferred arms and ammunition to its Free Syria Army (FSA) rebel allies, pro-Ankara newspapers reported, though some experts say the distribution of weapons won’t affect the outcome of any conflict. \u0026nbspIdlib province on 11 September in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensive (Getty)Turkey has also begun to bolster a dozen outposts it operates in and around Idlib with additional troops and military vehicles.

But Turkey’s moves have upped the geopolitical cost of any attempt to take Idlib by the pro-Assad camp that includes Russia, Iran, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, as well as Iraqi Shia militias backed by Tehran.Around three\u0026nbspmillion Syrians live in Idlib province, a hilly agricultural region by\u0026nbspthe Turkish border. Many of the displaced have resettled in the province from other parts of the country or were forcibly relocated there from opposition enclaves recaptured by Damascus.Turkey, the primary patron of the Syrian opposition and the host to 3.5 million displaced Syrians, has vehemently opposed the regime offensive to retake Idlib. The US and Europe have urged a political solution over Idlib and warned against the military campaign. US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley repeated warnings that any use of chemical weapons by the regime would trigger a response by Washington.The UK on Saturday warned of an impending humanitarian crisis amid reports of attacks on hospitals and clinics in rebel-held territory. “The UK has been clear that a man-made catastrophe in Idlib is entirely avoidable,” Alistair Burt, Middle East minister, said in a a press release. “We support the urgent diplomatic efforts being made by Turkey and the UN.”Ankara worries in part that another bloody confrontation in Syria could flood Turkey and Europe with hundreds of thousands of fresh refugees.Airstrikes in in Idlib, northwestern SyriaAlready, thousands of displaced Syrians have relocated from the southern edges of Idlib and northern Hama province to the Turkish-controlled Afrin district adjacent to the border, said a source in Afrin. On Friday, Turkey hosted a meeting of French, German\u0026nbspand Russian officials ahead of a possible meeting of those countries’ leaders over Idlib.In addition to a possible confrontation between pro-Assad forces and Turkey, Idlib could be the flashpoint for a conflict with jihadi forces that dominate parts of the province. In recent days, al-Qaeda’s international supporters on social media have also blasted fellow jihadis in Idlib for allowing Turkey to dispatch armoured vehicles and trucks carrying tanks into Syria, as depicted in videos posted on social media.A 13 September statement signed by 15 prominent al-Qaeda supporters questioned Hayat Tahrir\u0026nbspal-Sham (HTS), the jihadi group that is a dominant player in Idlib, for granting Turkey access to the province.Mr Oliver suggested Turkey could be bolstering the observation points for fear of attacks by jihadis as well as to stymie Damascus’s offensive. “The internal problems for Idlib are huge,” he said. “We are talking about an area that has FSA factions, HTS, you have Isis\u0026nbspcells, you have other small entities.”For now Turkey’s moves have complicated plans to retake Idlib. Syrian civilians have begun to mass around the bolstered observation points in hopes that they won’t be struck by government and Russian warplanes. Thousands of Syrians who have fled the attacks of the regime and Russia are settling in the areas where the Turkish army\u0027s military posts are, because they think it is safe, the pro-government Vatan newspaper reported, publishing photos showing people purported to be sheltering near the outposts.On Friday, for the second week in a row, thousands of Syrians in the province took to the streets in peaceful, colourful demonstrations that recalled the first months of the 2011 uprising against the Assad family’s decades-long dictatorship. “For the time being, everything is postponed,” Mr Oliver said. “There is no final agreement and no final disagreement.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1018322_1.jpg","title":"brexit news theresa may tory party conference hard brexit","story":"With anger growing over the controversial Chequers plan which will leave Britain \u0026ldquohalf in, half out of the EU, the Bow Group and Bruges Group have organised a conference on 1 and 2 October.In a further blow to the Conservative leadership, the Brexit conference at the Birmingham Midland Institute will hear from leading Tories including former cabinet ministers Priti Patel, John Redwood and Owen Paterson.There will also be speeches by senior Tory MEP and trade expert David Campbell Bannerman and Andrea Jenkyns, the Tory MP who has openly been collecting signatures to hold a vote of confidence in Theresa May\u0026rsquos leadership.Respected pro-Brexit Tory MPs Daniel Kawcynski and Sir Bill Cash will also make speeches and share a platform with former Ukip MEP Steven Woolfe who has been controversially blocked from joining the Conservatives.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remains closely tied to the Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May has agreed to an amendment that would stop Britain being tied to Europes customs union after we quit the EU.In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons on July 17 2018, Mrs May managed to see off a damaging attempt, winning by just six votes.Mrs May was then defeated on a separate amendment to her flagship Trade Bill, which will require her to seek continued UK participation in the EUs system for regulation of medicines after Brexit.Now her Cabinet is required to ensure that the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.A deal on the UKs withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for the summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship.However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November.Once a dead has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it.The former Foreign Secretary claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of hard - Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees - Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis and Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.     A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433237387.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says conservative party theresa may","story":"No new leader could change the fact this Government has no majority.

It will also make le more dficult in innumerable ways - affecting driving licences, passports and phone bills.Today is just a cynical ploy by the Government to make whatever pathetic little deal they bring back from Brussels look less bad in comparison.Emmanuel Macrons Europe minister warned that Eurostar trains and planes from Britain will be turned away from France in the event of a No Deal Brexit.In comments that came just an hour after the Government papers were published, Nathalie Loiseau insisted it was not Le Project Fear to warn of travel chaos that but it “would happen – among other examples”.Asked about the issue following a speech in London, she said: This is the reason we need to prepare for a No Deal because we cannot wake up and say to our citizens and businesses we thought it would never happen so we are not ready.Cabinet ministers met this morning to discuss the No Deal contingency plans which are designed to ensure Britain is ready for the possible collapse of talks with Brussels.Speaking before the plans were published, Dominic Raab warned rebel MPs they will have no choice but to back Theresa May - or risk Brexit chaos.He said Brexit rebels would have to be responsible and rubbished the idea they can force through an alternative plan by next March.Tory MPs from all sides of the Brexit ide have called for the PM to chuck her proposals set out at Chequers.But the Brexit Secretary said it would be impossible to replace Mrs Mays blueprint with a dferent type of trade deal.He told the BBCs Today programme: When push comes to shove it will be a binary choice between the deal we bring back and No Deal, and I think that will focus minds.Colleagues will look at the choices theyve got and theyve got to be responsible for that.During the interview he also hit out at firms such as John Lewis which blame their economic troubles on Brexit.Mr Raab said: I think there will be the temptation from some businesses that arent doing so well to blame Brexit and I think thats a mistake.He confirmed that we wont pay a £39billion orce bill  we dont manage to secure a withdrawal agreement.Mr Raab said: Its not a threat, its statement of fact as part of our No Deal planning.We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.DOZENS of Brexit-backing Tory MPs are furious with Theresa Mays Chequers plan, which would see Britain following EU rules for goods even after weve left.They have launched a huge campaign to persuade the PM to drop her proposals and replace them with a looser free-trade deal.Some hardliners are even trying to ditch Mrs May altogether - convinced that only a Brexit true believer can truly carry out the will of the people.But both efforts are massively complicated by the fact that we have just six months before Britain officially leaves the EU.Senior Brexiteers are in despair about the leadership chatter, warning that  the PM was forced out Remainers would seize the opportunity to delay or even overturn Brexit.And as Dominic Raab points out today, the short timeline makes it dficult for any plan other than Mrs Mays to take shape.If Britain and the EU do thrash out a withdrawal deal later this year, it will almost certainly be based on the PMs Chequers deal.MPs will have a straight choice when it comes to a Commons vote - support the deal as it stands, or back No Deal.Ministers are gambling that enough Tories will lose their nerve and vote with the Government to outnumber the rebels who team up with Jeremy Corbyn to try and defeat it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You know youre stealing?The 400-mile-wide hurricane had already splintered buildings, trapped hundreds of people and swamped entire communities along the Carolina coast by Friday.Forecasters warned that drenching rains of up to 3ft as the 90mph storm crawls westward across North and South Carolina could trigger epic flooding well inland over the next few days.After the raging storm hit, more than 70 people had to be rescued from a Jacksonville hotel when its roof started to collapse leaving le-threatening structural damage.Firefighters - who found a basketball-sized holes in the hotel wall and roof - had to force their way into flooded rooms to get to those trapped inside.The terried guests staying at the Triangle Motor Inn were later moved to a local hurricane safety centre to ride out the storm as parts of the ruptured hotel were sent flying through the air.But hardest hit by the storm - described as catastrophic by the National Weather Service - was the besieged town of New Bern, where more than 360 pleaded for emergency crews to rescue them from the dangerous deluge.Local officials revealed they had earlier urged residents to take shelter at the highest points of their homes, including rooftops.Florence flattened trees, crumbled roads and knocked out power to 900,000 homes and businesses, and the assault wasnt anywhere close to being over, with the siege in the Carolinas expected to last all weekend.North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper: Its an uninvited brute who doesnt want to leave, adding that Florence is a thousand-year rain event.He added: The sun rose this morning on an extremely dangerous situation and its getting worse.The hurricane was wreaking havoc and could wipe out entire communities as it makes its violent grind across our state for days, the governor said.He said parts of North Carolina had seen storm surges the bulge of seawater pushed ashore by the hurricane as high as 10ft.Wilmington Police Chief Ralph Evangelous told ABC News: I see a biblical proportion flood event thats going to occur. I see the beach communities being inundated with water and destruction that will be pretty, pretty epic in nature.The city of Wilmington has been completely cut off from from the rest of North Carolina after heavy floods put the city without power.After reaching a terrying Category 4 peak of 140 mph earlier in the week, Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane at 7.15am at Wrightsville Beach.Hurricanes have all the vital ingredients needed to form tornadoes - in fact some wouldnt happen without them.Firstly they carry within their structure supercells - which are rotating well-organised thunderstorms.Hurricanes also bring with them warm, moist air which causes an instability in the atmosphere.This takes the form of a layer of warm air with slightly colder and less-moist air above it.It becomes hugely unstable because the warm air wants to rise, since it is less dense than the cooler air.Finally, hurricanes create abrupt changes in wind speed and direction - which form swirling air patterns, called rolls.These vortices can then flip vertically to create their own tornadoes.The eye of Hurricane Florence has made landfall in the US bringing merciless 90mph winds which have already left hundreds cut off.One family told CNN how they barricaded themselves into their eastern North Carolina home as the waters steadily rose.Annazette Riley-Cromartie held back tears describing the scene, saying: While we were still waiting, my husband kept hearing people yelling for help.You just keep hearing people yelling, and you cant do anything. Its the worst feeling in the world.US President Donald Trump is expected to travel to the areas hit by Hurricane Florence next week.The storm will be a test of his administration - less than two months before the mid-term elections.The delay in the travel is to ensure it would not disrupt and rescue or recovery efforts, according to the White House.The news comes as radar images have shown a half-dozen tornadoes forming in east and south east North Carolina, the National Weather Service reported.Florences forward movement during the day slowed to a crawl - sometimes it was moving no faster than a human can walk and that enabled it to pile on the rain.The town of Oriental, North Carolina, got more than 20 inches of rain just a few hours into the deluge, others got well over a foot.For people living inland in the Carolinas, the moment of maximum peril from flash flooding could arrive days later, because it takes time for rainwater to drain into rivers and for those streams to crest.Preparing for the worst, about 9,700 National Guard troops and civilians were deployed with high-water vehicles, helicopters and boats that could be used to pluck people from the floodwaters.Authorities have also warned of the threat of mudslides and the risk of an environmental disaster from floodwaters washing over industrial waste sites and hog farms.Florence was seen as a major test for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was heavily criticised as slow and unprepared last year for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, where the death toll was put at nearly 3,000.The National Hurricane Center said Florence will eventually break up over the southern Appalachians and make a right hook to the northeast, its rainy remnants moving into the mid-Atlantic states and New England by the middle of next week.Meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels said Florence could dump a staggering 18 trillion gallons of rain over a week on North Carolina, South Carolinas, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Maryland.Thats enough to cover the entire state of Texas with nearly 4 inches of water, he calculated.Giant storm: About 400 miles wide, with hurricane-force winds stretching across a 160-mile spanHeavy rains: Parts of the Carolinas could see 20 inches to 30 inches with isolated areas getting 40 inchesStorm surge: up to 13 feet , and seawaters could push inland two milesThe intensity: Winds of 90mph below the 111mph threshold for a major hurricane but still very dangerousGoing dark: More than 320,000 outages, mostly in North CarolinaPopulated coastline: 11 million Americans live in areas under storm watches and warningsGrounded: Nearly 1,200 flights cancelledPotential losses: Meteorologists estimate up to £40 BILLION in economic damagesNorth Carolina alone is forecast to get 9.6 trillion gallons.On Friday, coastal streets in the Carolinas flowed with frothy ocean water, and pieces of torn-apart buildings flew through the air.The few cars out on a main street in Wilmington had to swerve to avoid fallen trees, metal debris and power lines.Traffic lights out of order because of power failures swayed in the gusty wind and roof shingles were peeled off a hotel.The Wilmington airport had a wind gust clocked at 105 mph, the highest since Hurricane Helene in 1958, while airlines cancelled more than 2,400 flights through Sunday."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433620436.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the sun says russia lies assassins","story":"Admittedly it’s hard not to mock the absurdity of claiming two State assassins armed with Novichok were actually cathedral-loving tourists.But Dawn Sturgess died.

So it’s fair to say I’m not a fan.But I was appalled by the rude, ignorant mob of “class warriors” who heckled his kids and their elderly nanny outside the family home this week.It was cruel, savage and out of order. Rees-Mogg has chosen to be a politician and is used to being barracked.His children, however, are NOT public figures. They are little kids, who looked scared by the thuggish behaviour of the idiots, who did their cause no good at all.They were there to protest about the minimum wage, and one of them shouted at the children that their nanny, Veronica Crook, wasn’t paid very much to “wipe their bottoms”.Veronica, who has been with the family for half a century, was not best pleased by this, and in a brisk, no-nonsense way defended her boss and ushered her charges indoors. You got the feeling she would dearly have loved to give the protesters a very hard stare and sit them on the naughty step.Politicians from all sides expressed their disgust but those responsible don’t think they have done anything wrong.The minimum wage is well worth fighting for, but not like this.The demonstrators managed to humanise Rees-Mogg, and gained him bucketloads of sympathy.

May needs them to say or, preferably, do something that shows her plan is making headway and is a realistic way forward.“The Government has got to show that it is making some progress,” admits one leading Cabinet minister.No one in Downing Street is expecting a dramatic breakthrough at this summit, though.Theresa May told the Cabinet this week that Salzburg would be a “staging post” on the way to a deal.The British hope is that on Thursday, the EU will announce a special November meeting to discuss Brexit. That, combined with the October EU Council, should provide time for a deal to be done.But, in a sign of how the timetable could slip further, one Downing Street figure close to the negotiations has told influential Europeans that  a deal was done in December, the Government could still get it through parliament in time for Brexit day.Others in No10  are insistent that the withdrawal agreement needs to be done by November. What May needs to judge though is whether the EU is serious about engaging with her Chequers plan or not.Influential Cabinet ministers are worried that the EU will never formally kill off Chequers but will not ever really take it seriously. Then at the last, May will be left with only two options when it comes to  getting a withdrawal agreement.She would either have to leave Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU — a ision of the UK that May has repeatedly said is unacceptable.Or, sign the whole of the UK up to a customs union with the EU, which she has, again, said she does not want to do as it would deny Britain an independent trade policy.If she does not want to take either of these bad deals, she would be left with No Deal.The Government still hopes that the member states, who are accountable to their electorates for the consequences of no deal, will tell the Commission to be more flexible as the clock ticks down.  But Chequers, which was sold to the Cabinet on the basis it was “negotiable”, has not yet made the progress many in Government hoped it would.If this does not change soon, it will be time for Mrs May to change tack. At the same time, the Government must step up its preparations for le outside the EU.“Project After” is looking into how Britain can benefit from the freedoms it will have once it has left. But ministers tell me that it “needs more work”.This should be a priority for the Government. For Brexit does not guarantee this  country’s success or failure.  It is what we do after Brexit with our new-found  flexibility that will ­determine that.The Government must be ready to seize this moment.PHILIP HAMMOND has twice had to be slapped down by the Chief Whip in Cabinet this week.On Tuesday, he talked about how there would be a lot of “squealing” about universal credit. Julian Smith, the chief whip, then picked him up on his language.He said that talking about “squealing” doesn’t help. .Those sympathetic to Hammond say that he was talking specically about Labour when he used the word “squealing”. But it is another reminder of his political tin ear.Then on Thursday, Hammond raised the prospect of delaying Brexit day. After the ­legislative timetable for getting ready for “no deal” – which is tight –  had been outlined, Hammond pointed out that the Government has the power to put the Brexit date back.But doing this would be politically explosive.No one else present supported Hammond’s point and the chief whip shot it down, saying they would get all the legislation through in time.Theresa May then explicitly ruled out delaying Brexit day. Allies of Hammond say that he was only talking about an administrative pause of a few weeks.They argue that he only made the point after Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, raised concerns about there not being enough parliamentary time to get everything in place.But Any delay in exit day would cause a massive political crisis. No10 ­sources are adamant that there is “zero chance” of Brexit day not being March  29, 2019.But there is a major problem for the ­Government when the Chancellor, one of the three most senior figures in it, has such a political tin ear that he raises the prospect.This date would make things all too easy for the Government’s critics. It would be “The Zombie ­Budget”, “Hammond’s ­horror show”, “The bloodsucking Budget”.So, a Halloween Budget is out. No final date has yet been agreed for it. But the aim is for the Budget to take place before the special November EU Brexit summit.The Government does not want to risk the Budget ­getting caught up in the row over Theresa May’s ­negotiating position.So keen is the Government to keep these two events separate, there is even talk of breaking with tradition and possibly ­holding the Budget on a Monday .WHILE Boris Johnson has been keeping up a regular verbal barrage against Theresa May’s Chequers plan, she has not given it the hard sell.There has been no national tour, no fireside chat with the country or impassioned speech.But next week, Theresa May will try and make the case for her plan in an extended interview with Panorama. The BBC show was even allowed to film the start of Thursday’s “no-deal” Cabinet.Number 10’s view is that most voters don’t know what the Chequers plan means. They think that a lot of those who are hostile to it, particularly on the Tory side, are more aware of the row over it –  and particularly the resignations of Boris and David Davis – than the details of the plan.If the Prime Minister  though is going to persuade sceptical voters of the merit of her approach, she needs to admit that something has changed and explain why.It won’t work  she simply says she’s stuck rigidly to her red lines.Instead, she needs to ask voters to put themselves in her shoes, to under­stand why she has made the trade-offs that she has.Mrs May must treat the electorate like grown-ups.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In his very first disastrous Budget he tried, and failed, to raise National Insurance for self­-employed strivers. Has he learned?

The next it’s sugar. Then carbs. A few weeks later, sugar is back on the naughty step.It’s the same with alcohol. Until recently, a glass of wine a day kept heart attacks at bay. Last month, we learned that NO amount of alcohol is safe. Then this week our new goal, apparently, should be two teetotal days a week.It’s hard to keep up — and no wonder many people ignore all the reports. Who wants to be told what to do by a bunch of scientists who can’t make up their mind?But the latest news from Public Health England should give us all pause for thought, because British women now have some of the lowest le expectancies in Europe.Girls born in the UK today can expect to die three-and-a-half years earlier than girls in Spain, the country that comes out top in this report. The reasons? Rising levels of obesity and poor cancer survival rates.British women also fare badly when it comes to premature deaths — defined as before 75.Many are caused by cancer, heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to smoking, alcohol and junk food.France, home of Michelin star chefs, is also way down on the list. And so is Italy.My supporting evidence is that I live with an Italian, who would be more likely to attend a funeral in a jester’s hat than eat a bag of crisps.Clearly, we all need to take a leaf out of the same book.The prevailing wisdom is that it’s more expensive to eat healthily. But that’s not true.A recent report from the Institute of Economic Affairs shows it’s possible to have your five-a-day for less than 30p — and a nutritious,  plain, diet can be bought for less than £1 a day.Meanwhile, the cheapest adult meal in McDonald’s is about £4.50, for which you could make a fresh vegetable curry for the whole family.So it’s not about money. Why, then, do us British women fare so badly?I wonder  we are so daunted by images of women airbrushed to perfection, in adverts and on social media, we feel we can’t compete. So we give up, eating what we like and not exercising.Because keeping really fit takes serious work.The latest insight into this is from movie star Mark Wahlberg who shared his daily schedule this week.He’s in bed by 7.30pm then up at 2.30am for the first of his two daily workouts. His fitness schedule only allows for two hours’ “work” a day — and thus it becomes clear his job is, in fact, his physique.Since most of us spend at least ten hours a day working and commuting, you can see why it’s often easier not to bother.But it’s not just our health that’s in peril. It’s also that of our children, for whom we are the primary role models.Not about vanity, but good healthI have evidence in the form of my best friend, who is a marathon-running exercise junkie — as is her daughter.I, on the other hand, although not proud of this fact, do no exercise — and my daughter doesn’t enjoy it as much as her friends.Getting fit and losing weight can feel impossible.But look at Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who this week announced that he has lost 7st and put his Type 2 diabetes in remission, which is pretty inspiring.So let’s choose to make this bad news story into a positive and use it as inspiration for change.Let’s aim for two booze-free days a week.And maybe ditch the biscuits for a bit and make some other small, sustainable changes that will leave us able to go for a brisk walk without fearing a heart attack.This is not about vanity, it’s about good health. Because the alternative is sobering.When it started off 18 years ago it was innovative and exciting TV. But now it’s degenerated into a hotbed of fame-hungry wannabes pitted against each other and behaving horribly as a result.Now it’s been axed. About time, too.I BELIEVE in people’s right to protest – of course – against political views they disagree with. But, Ian Bone, the protestor who assailed Jacob Rees-Mogg and his children on their own doorstep has crossed a line.“Your daddy is a horrible man,” Mr Bone told Mr Rees-Mogg’s bewildered-looking children, who will likely be traumatised by the incident – and will certainly not forget.MPs are already putting a lot on the line to serve their country. Many endure threats of violence or even death – and just look at what happened to Jo Cox.Yes, it’s fine to disagree with politicians and to protest. But taking it out on children and trying to make them feel bad about their father is bullying behaviour that is wholly unacceptable.Speaking to LBC afterwards, Mr Bone, who is 71, said that he saw no problem with involving children in his protest.But despite being happy to bring Mr Rees-Mogg’s offspring into the argument, he refused to speak about his own five children, and repeatedly refused to answer  he would have been happy for them to be treated in the same way.Talk about hypocritical.EVERYONE praised as progress the BBC’s “solution” to the inequality on comedy panel shows, which has been to ensure there is at least one woman on every show.But then we hear from Sandi Toksvig that their contributions are often edited out.The QI host told the Radio Times: “There are panel shows that struggle to get women on, and that’s because . . . in the edit they are often seen just laughing at the boys and not saying anything at all, even though I know for a fact in the recording they were clever.”Turns out that turning up and being funny isn’t quite enough,  you are a woman, to be given the same air time as men. How annoying.MY Woman of the Week award goes to Carol Vorderman who, at 57, is clearly in her absolute element and loving le.She looks healthy and oozes confidence, especially in these skin-tight jeans.She told ITV’s Lorraine this week she’s happy being single and is not looking for a “keeper” or another intense relationship.In fact, she said she “couldn’t think of anything worse”.How refreshing. And what a great role model she is for women in their fties and beyond.WATCHING the video of a homeless man being sprayed with paint in Middlesbrough made my blood boil.The poor man – who was found dead just days later in a cemetery – is filmed sat against a wall, covered in paint, as a man brags: “This is how we dealwith the beggars on the street.”This disregard for another human being’s dignity is obscene and the yob should be made to volunteer helping homeless people.Until he sees that dehumanising this man who had hit troubled times was the lowest of the low.DID you see Madonna’s daughter, 21-year old Lourdes hitting the runway for the Gypsy Sport Spring Summer 2019 showcase at New York Fashion Week?It’s so dispiriting, isn’t it, that the headline news about her appearance, which could have focused on so many dferent things – her incredible confidence, for one – was that . . . she hadn’t shaved her legs, top.I guess true equality will have been achieved when a woman’s hairy calves go unmentioned and are seen as neither here nor there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Therefore we are trying to clary the EU position.

The majority, of course, have been a boon for Britain.But successive governments have ignored concerns about the population explosion and its resulting social costs, relying on high immigration to keep the Treasury’s coffers pumped up.That’s why only 13 per cent of voters believe our politicians tell the truth about immigration.About time MPs start to listen.A spokesman for British Future said participants were questioned on the level of trust in the government to manage immigration.He said distrust had been building for almost 20 years thanks to previous governments failure to predict the large migration flows from countries like Poland, Romania and Bulgaria.Despite the low levels of trust in the present Governments ability to manage immigration, it found the majority of those involved held a more balanced view on the issue than is reflected in the media.They found almost two thirds agreed “It is better when migrants commit to stay in Britain, put down roots and integrate,” compared to 39 per cent who agreed “It is better when migrants come here to work for a few years without putting down roots and then  home.Dubbed balancers, these respondents felt immigration brings economic and cultural gains to the UK, but also worry about control, fairness and pressures on public services.The research found 65 per cent of people thought migrants bring valuable skills for the economy and public services such as the NHS, while 59 per cent believed ersity is a good thing for British culture.But more than half of respondents said public services are under strain as a result of immigration, and a further 52 per cent believed migrants are willing to work for less - putting jobs at risk and lowering wages.On Brexit, four in ten of those who took part in the ICM poll were willing to keep the current free movement rules  it meant a better deal for British business.But 33 per cent of respondents felt that the UK should not offer a preferential immigration deal to the EU, even  this limited the trade deal that the PM could strike.Some 53 per cent of Leave voters believed Theresa May should not offer a preferential immigration deal to the EU, even  business would lose out, compared with 16 per cent of Remain voters.Conservative voters, older people, those without higher level qualications and those who live outside big cities were also more likely to favour this option.Rosie Carter, of Hope not Hate and the reports co-author, said: Immigration is a national issue, but people see it through a local lens.Where people live, and their living conditions, makes a real dference - that includes the perceived impact of migration on their community, broader grievances about economic insecurity and levels of contact with migrants and ethnic minorities too.An official National Conversation on Immigration would give people a chance to express their concerns in a constructive debate, so anxieties are not driven underground or exploited by those seeking to stoke ision.Jill Rutter of British Future and co-author of the report, said: “The lack of trust we found in the Government to manage immigration is quite shocking. People want to have their voices heard on the choices we make, and to hold their leaders to account on their promises.“While people do want the UK Government to have more control over who can come to the UK, most of them are ‘balancers’ – they recognise the benefits of migration to Britain, both economically and culturally, but also voice concerns about pressures on public services and housing.“Most people are pragmatic and have constructive ideas about the choices we face. They want a system that manages the pressures to secure the gains of immigration – but right now they don’t trust the government to deliver it.”Leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg told The Sun: The message from this troubling survey is that whatever conclusion we come to as we leave the EU we must tell people the truth.

Across the country, Labour politicians are calling for a referendum rerun that would take us all back to square one.Now they have gone further and admitted that they want to keep the UK in the EU beyond March 2019 - almost three years after the country voted to leave.”Brexiteer Tory Theresa Villiers insisted voters just wanted the Government to get on with the job.She told the BBC: It is so undemocratic to ask people to vote again just because there is an elite establishment that does not like the answer they were given the first time.We have to listen to the result of the referendum and implement it.Mr Khans Labour colleague Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner also disagreed with him - saying it would only help Theresa May.He told Sky Newss Sophy Ridge on Sunday: Weve said we havent ruled anything off the table. But actually to have a second referendum would be to throw this Government a leline. Mr Khans intervention is expected to lead to mutiny in the ranks at Labour conference in Liverpool next week.Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to reverse current party policy and push for another referendum.More than 100 motions have been tabled by unions and party activists for the move.Mr Khan said: For the first time the British public should have a say on the outcome of the negotiation.It is really important it is not a re-run of the first referendum.It came as International Trade Secretary Liam Fox insisted there must be no delay to Brexit in March next year after it emerged Chancellor Philip Hammond floated the prospect of a postponement at the no deal Cabinet on Thursday.Asked  there was any reason for a delay, Dr Fox told Sky Newss Sophy Ridge on Sunday: I’d say no. As I’ve said before, extending Article 50 until we’ve got an agreement is effectively allowing the European Union to dictate when Britain will leave the European Union itself.The public have given us an instruction in the referendum, there has to be a time set for our exit, that’s the 29th March next year and we should honour that.How strange, then, that he has changed his mind now.It is the latest abysmal decision Khan has made. He was one of the 36 Labour MPs who nominated Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership ballot.He also led the virtue-signalling attacks on Donald Trump.Meanwhile, what has he done about the soaring murder rate in our capital? Nothing, other than to blame the bloodshed on everyone else.For all his Remainer whining, does Khan think voters will meekly accept the forcing of a second referendum?And even leaving the likelihood of civil unrest aside,  Leave win again — as seems probable — will he want to make it “Best out of five”?He should sort London out and stop trying to mess up the country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I came here when I was 30 and opened a strip club but I had been trying to get out of that game, I wanted to do something dferent.“One night I had been drinking with some friends and they said St Robert was like the armpit around here. I said it should be called Uranus.“We made a few jokes about it but I kept the idea“Now people love it. Nobody changes in the US. They see the funny side. This takes a thick skin, though. Ten per cent of the people are offended . . . but who cares?“I am the only person who currently lives in Uranus but we want to make it bigger.”With a straight face, he adds: “Uranus is always expanding.”Louie’s original plan was to sell T-shirts with pun-laden slogans but, frustrated by slow progress, decided to earn his chocolatier licence.Some months later he had closed the strip club and opened the Uranus Fudge Factory And General Store.One sign there reads: “The best fudge comes from Uranus.”Shop workers greet every customer with their two favourite phrases — “welcome to Uranus” and “thanks for picking Uranus”.The store sells dozens of flavours of fudge, mugs, T-shirts, handguns, rles and crossbows. A sign on a door reads: “Restricted employees only or Scarlett Johansson.”Amanda Miller, 38, who has worked behind the counter for 16 months, said: “Since the strip club closed the place is family friendly. We have so much fun stuff to do here now.“The people that come here love it — you need a sense of humour. Seeing people’s expressions is amazing.”A staggering 30,000 visitors each month arrive to sample the fudge, view the “world’s largest belt buckle” and try the town’s other experiences, including Escape Uranus.For 25 , punters can spend an hour trying to flee from one of two locked rooms — a twisted doctor’s office and a room dedicated to Italian painter Leonardo da Vinci — by solving a series of riddles before time runs out.The Sun chose a third option and was given ten minutes to escape from handcuffs behind the bars of a locked prison cell, eventually doing so with just seconds to spare.After our successful escape we proudly held up a sign saying: “Cracked it in Uranus.”We toured its other attractions too, including a sideshow museum that features pickled animals in jars, including a two-headed bull shark, Cyclops pig with a fth leg on its head, a three-legged chicken and a two-headed snapping turtle.In a dark corner of the museum, which is not allowed to be photographed, performer Katya Kadavera swallows 20in swords and performs card tricks.There is also an electric chair near ieties of snakes and a capybara called Peanut, billed as the largest rodent in the world.Louie regales The Sun with his plans for an on-site brewery, a new 50ft rocket ship welcome sign and a wedding chapel, and says: “Who doesn’t want to get married in Uranus, right?”For now, the current collection of oddities in Uranus seems to be pulling people in.Karen Ferrantella, 61, was driving from Chicago to Kimberling City, Missouri, with friend Tracey Pickford, 60, when they spotted Uranus.They ended up buying a bagful of goodies, including magnets and corn relish which said it was “fresh from Uranus to the table”. The pair were drawn in by the welcoming signs and another which implores visitors to “help keep Uranus clean”.Karen, a dietician, told The Sun: “We started laughing hysterically when we saw the road sign. We could not believe it was actually a place. They are obviously playing along with this idea and it is great. It is a brilliant marketing ploy.”Though not everyone has been having fun in and around Uranus, especially after last week’s closure of the Daily Guide — a paper in the city of Waynesville, around six miles away.The Guide’s former editor, Natalie Sanders, 42, was approached by Louie to start the Uranus Examiner.But despite the potential openings Uranus is now offering in terms of jobs, former teacher Luge Hardman, the mayor of Waynesville, said: “I’m sorry but the innuendo of that title puts my city up for public ridicule and I will not be a part of it.”Darrell Todd Maurina, who runs a rival online publication, added: “That name does not indicate a serious newspaper.”But mum-of-nine Natalie, who has edited two papers in the past, tells The Sun that despite its comical name, she intends to run the 24-page publication as a proper tabloid with a full staff.It will go out free to 15,000 homes in the area next month and, thanks to the publicity of the name row, businesses are calling from far away as Australia to place adverts.Natalie says: “My husband joked that I was the most famous newspaper editor in the world and I didn’t even have a newspaper yet.“But to me the name doesn’t really matter. There are a lot of stories around here and we get serious crime.I am an experienced journalist and am good at my job.”Amid the innuendo and sniggering, Natalie makes a serious point about the decline of local newspapers. She says: “Small towns and small places really need a newspaper. You need someone to keep track on what your city council is doing and what the school board is doing.”In a rare introspective moment, Louie adds: “What people need,  they want a big strong community, is a big strong newspaper.”But he can’t be serious for long and adds: “We are going to probe Uranus with your newspaper. Get to the bottom of things. I’m a cub reporter today but someday I will be a crack reporter.”While not all locals are fans of Louie’s town, few could argue that Uranus has a certain ring to it.GOT a story?

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

Prepare for the worst, Hong Kong Security Minister John Lee Ka-chiu urged residents.That warning followed Mangkhuts devastating march through the northern Philippines on Saturday with sustained winds of 127mph.Landslides caused by the pounding storm hit two villages in Itogon town in the mountain province of Benguet.Itogon Mayor Victorio Palangdan told The Associated Press by phone that at the height of the typhoons onslaught Saturday afternoon, dozens of people rushed into an old three-storey building in the village of Ucab.More than 33 miners have been confirmed dead and at least 40 are missing after the landslide, according to local reports.Search and rescue missions are continuing, and there are fears the death toll could rise above 100.Elsewhere, two children were badly hurt in China when a bouncy castle they were playing on was ripped from the ground and flipped upside down.The accident happened outside the Youa International Plaza shopping complex in Changde, a city in Central China’s Hunan province, which is on the periphery of Typhoon Mangkhut.CCTV footage dated 16th September - the day the typhoon made landfall in South China - shows the large bouncy castle being swept up by the wind and flipped upside down.Witnesses can be seen fleeing for safety as the inflatable structure lands back on the ground. Local police said witnesses reported two children trapped under the upside-down bouncy castle following the accident.The victims were found shortly after and taken to hospital together with third person - a young woman who was injured by a flipping trampoline, the authorities said.Shocking footage also emerged showing the moment an irresponsible dad makes his children pose for photographs in the storm as Typhoon Mangkhut hits Hong Kong.Joseph Anthony, 44, was filming the moment the disastrous typhoon hit Kennedy Town, Hong Kong, when he noticed a family posing for photographs.Upon further examination, Joseph noticed that it was in fact a father who appeared to be posing his two young children up for a photograph in the middle of the storm.Joseph, a local resident, said: “I was surprised to see the dad out with the kids that early on. I noticed he stopped to take photos of them in the middle of the road as that’s what caught my eye to capture some footage.“The typhoon had hit at the stage, as it went to signal eight at around midnight, then went to hurricane force 10 overnight.The World Meteorological Organisation branded the storm the strongest tropical cyclone the world has faced this year.The typhoon is expected to be downgraded to a tropical depression by Tuesday.Authorities in the Philippines say they were better prepared for the onslaught than in previous years.The deadliest storm in the country was Super Typhoon Haiyan, which killed over 7,000 people and affected millions in 2013.More than five million people were at risk when winds and gusts equivalent to a Category 4 Atlantic hurricane slammed the Philippines.An adviser to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said the victims died mostly in landslides and houses that got pummelled by the storms fierce winds and rain.Among the fatalities were an infant and a 2-year-old child who died with their parents after the couple refused to immediately evacuate from their high-risk community in a mountain town.About 87,000 people evacuated from high-risk areas of the Philippines. Officials advised them not to  home until the lingering danger had passed.Its still a le and death situation, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said, citing past drownings in swollen rivers in mountain provinces after storms had passed.Storm warnings remained in effect in 10 northern provinces, including Cagayan, which could still be lashed by devastating winds, forecasters said. Thousands of people in the typhoons path had been evacuated.Cagayans public market was severely damaged, its roof ripped apart and wooden stalls in disarray. Outside a popular shopping mall, debris was scattered everywhere and government workers cleared roads of fallen trees.Many shops and houses were damaged but most residents remained indoors as occasional gusts sent small pieces of tin sheets and other debris flying dangerously.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Dividing the opposition – as the SDP did in the 80s when they cemented Maggie Thatcher in No10 – would be a fresh gt to the Tories. Listen for two minutes to the Labour kamikazes hell-bent on destroying their left-wing leader. It becomes clear some so-called moderates would prefer the Tories to Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister. In Brighton this week, Vince Cable’s shop-soiled Liberal Democrats seem so contaminated by the disastrous ConDem coalition they have nothing to lose from starting again. But let nobody be under any illusion – the governing party would immediately benefit from what would be billed as a realignment of politics. Conservatives understand that they rule by sticking together. A party that last split in 1846 over the Corn Laws is the most likely to survive Brexit basically intact.  Labour malcontents such as Chris Leslie and Chuka Umunna – who are part of a dozen-strong group toying with following Thatcher-admiring maverick Frank Field out of the party – are mistaken  they think the grass is greener on the yellow side. Cable enjoyed more parties than Katie Price before settling on the Lib Dems. Behind his lugubrious air of a funeral director officiating at his own burial he is trying to recruit a Labour terracotta army to guard his tomb. I fail to see how a new Liberal-SDP Alliance could deliver what evaded the originals in the 80s. Then the Gang of Four, who led almost 30 defectors from Labour, were substantial politicians. No disrespect intended to Umunna or Leslie, but they are not a Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams or David Owen. Bill Rodgers perhaps – the one everybody forgets.

But Perry Tatler miraculously survived the suicide attempt five months ago and has bravely spoken out from his hospital bed as he continues his recovery. He has apologised to the witnesses of the traumatic event and pledged to turn his le around.  The 29-year-old can vividly recall the moment when he kissed his two children, aged two and one, goodbye for what he believed was for the last time after taking them to the park, reports Devon Live .   Perry then made the journey to Torquay railway station on a busy Saturday afternoon on April 7. During the incident two air ambulances landed at nearby Torquay Rugby Club and train services through the station were suspended for more than two hours. Peter was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  after being shot twice while serving in Afghanistan. While he has no recollection of those who were around him, he says he can clearly remember being in a ‘zone’ where he had lost all hope of overcoming the problems he had been unable to share with anyone else.  Despite throwing himself in front of a train travelling through the platform, he has lived to tell the tale and is encouraging others to seek help  they are feeling suicidal. The dad-of-two remains in hospital five months on having sustained a broken back, shoulder and ribs, and a bleed on the brain. But he is walking again with the aid of crutches and a back brace, and it uncertain whether he will make a full recovery. Perry said: “When you get that low you feel like you’ve got no other choice. That’s how the demons make you feel. It sounds really bad but I don’t regret doing it as it’s made me appreciate le more.  “But I do want to say sorry to the people who were there on the platform at the time, and the train driver. I didn’t want to put any harm onto anyone else mentally. “I also want to say thank you to the emergency services who I have a new respect for, as I do all the nurses who have looked after me.” For five years Perry served in the Army in the infantry, and two months into a tour serving in Afghanistan in 2011 he was shot in both legs during a routine patrol. He was medically discharged from the Army two years later and had been diagnosed with PTSD which he had been receiving support for. However, after ing back to civilian le he believed he could deal with his issues without help. Perry said: “The injuries I suffered in Afghanistan were more mental than physical because luckily both bullets went straight through my legs rather than hitting my main arteries or bone. “I physically recovered from the injuries but about a year after the incident I didn’t want to go out or do anything. “When I was discharged from the Army I thought I could deal with it myself.”  In 2017 Perry moved to Torquay with his ex-partner and held down a security job at Exeter Prison while his mental health deteriorated. After Christmas 2017 things started getting worse. “I put a smile on my face and all my work colleagues thought I was happy but it was all false, he admitted. Being a man I just bottled it up. I felt so low and helpless to the point I didn’t think I could take it anymore. ”The breaking point came that weekend in April when he took his children to the park for what he believed would be the last time he would ever see them again. “I kissed them goodbye which was the hardest thing knowing what I was going to do,” he said.“I then remember everything such as walking down to the train station and walking to the end of the platform. “I don’t remember seeing anyone but I have been told there were lots of people who saw me jump in front of the train, including children which I feel really bad about.

The Duchess of Sussex made several secret visits to the area before her wedding to Prince Harry, and met a group of women who came together to cook for friends, family and neighbours whose lives had been torn apart by the disaster. When she discovered they could only offer the Hubb Community Kitchen service two days a week because of funding, she suggested they released a cookbook to raise extra cash. Now the idea has become a reality, and Meghan has today released details of the book - Together: Our Community Cookbook - including a three minute video of her cooking in the kitchen with the women. She says: Together is a cookbook, but it\u0027s also the story of a west London community who gathered together in a kitchen and discovered the healing power of sharing food.  In January 2018, as I was settling into my new home in London, I met a group of women whose lives had been affected by the Grenfell fire. They had decided to get together to cook fresh food for their families and their neighbours. And so, for two days every week, these women were able to cook and share their delicious recipes together.  I\u0027m proud to be supporting this cookbook Together. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. The book, which is supported by The Royal Foundation and published by Penguin Random House companies,showcases over 50 recipes from women whose community was affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. In the book\u0027s foreword she writes: I immediately felt connected to this community kitchen it is a place for women to laugh, grieve, cry and cook together. Melding cultural identities under a shared roof, it creates a space to feel a sense of normalcy – in its simplest form, the universal need to connect, nurture, and commune through food, through crisis or joy – something we can all relate to…  Through this charitable endeavour, the proceeds will allow the kitchen to thrive and keep the global spirit of community alive. The duchess went to meet those affected at least twice at the beginning of the year, including a trip to the Al Manaar community mosque, which lies in the shadow of the charred shell of Grenfell Tower. She was without Prince Harry but was accompanied by a royal protection officer and one of the prince’s aides. The visits were compared to many made by her late mother-in-law Princess Diana, who often carried out charity work in secret. Speaking at the time, a leading Grenfell community member said: Meghan\u0027s visits mean so much to us. She has a special place in our hearts. A royal source added: Ms Markle has regularly been making private visits to organisations as she gets to know the charity sector.

Several years ago - Lorna can\u0027t quite remember - she inherited \u0026pound250,000 from her family. This was to be spent on drugs - and Lorna\u0027s innate generosity and kindness meant that she spent a lot of her inheritance on other struggling addicts.  She once was flush with cash and was spending almost \u0026pound18,000 a month on drugs or \u0026pound600 a day. Lorna now had the inheritance and started to spend. She said: When I got the money I was living locally, staying round friends and everything. My mates are all addicts so there was no way that I was going to leave them without. If I could have balanced it a bit more I would have done something with it. I am glad the money went to the area. The dollar has got invested. I don\u0027t mean any disrespect to my family. I lost a lot of weight and had a nervous breakdown. The heroin stopped me eating. It\u0027s very painful when you put weight back on your body and then you lose it. When you have a nervous breakdown it is very painful to your body. Lorna said she then attempted to rent a home in Cambridge but even with a small fortune in the bank she said no-one would let a property to her.  She said: I am an addict myself and I was dossing around dferent places. I tried to get a place but they weren\u0027t having none of it. That\u0027s what I don\u0027t understand. I had local connections and I was trying to rent a place. I had money to buy. I would have got a boat. Somebody must have been using my ID, plus the fact that I am adopted which doesn\u0027t help. Lorna spent most of her inheritance on feeding her habit and giving money away to addicts. She has little to show for it now and lives a hand-to-mouth existence. And in a heartbreaking moment, Lorna admitted her regret in not giving more of the money to her daughters and how she longs to see them again. The day before she spoke to Cambridgeshire Live she thought her daughter had driven past the spot in Mill Road where Lorna can be found on most days. She said: I guess I bought a few little bits and pieces - some jewellery. I bought both my girls some school kits. I love my girls. I have heard that they are doing really well. I hope so. I haven\u0027t seen them. I don\u0027t know  that was my daughter that I waved to the other day. I am not sure where they are. I would just like to see that they are safe. Sasha will be coming up to her mid-twenties and Faith eight years behind. They are both firing on all cylinders. They have all their pistons.  Lorna spoke of her le on the street and the camaraderie she felt with other rough sleepers. And she told of how many of her pals had been lost to drugs and violence. She said: It\u0027s not too bad on the street. We have a good crew around and we all look out for each other. Everyone has their own situation but no one will let anyone down. We\u0027ve all got each others backs here. We\u0027ve just lost some friends recently, but there\u0027s no way anyone is going to go unnoticed. No chance. That\u0027s not happening. Lorna also knew Peter Anderson, also known as Blue, who died from multiple stab wounds after being attacked on Stourbridge Common on July 25. Two London men have been charged with murder. Lorna said Blue was a gentle man and was shocked when she learned he had died. She added: I knew Blue. It is surreal to me like it hasn\u0027t happened. It\u0027s just surreal. I don\u0027t get it. And she spoke of the trouble in Mill Road and how traders wanted to clean up the area. She said: I score here but I\u0027ve not noticed much trouble. It\u0027s probably other people getting involved and other people coming down here  the truth be known. I know people locally and there are things that they go through. But I think it\u0027s other people getting involved. Asked  she would have done things dferently, she said: I had wanted to bless my children. I wanted something for them. Lorna has been through the courts over the years. In March 2012 armed police were called in after Lorna was seen carrying a kne by an ambulance crew. She was jailed for eight months after Cambridge Crown Court heard she had armed herself for protection before a confrontation with another woman.

Nottinghamshire schoolboy Tyler Broome suffered injuries normally only found in fighter pilots after mimicking a video called the Roundabout of Death. The 11-year-old was at a park with a friend when he was approached by an older boy with a motorbike. This was laid next to a roundabout and the back wheel was used to spin it at an incredible speed. Tyler, from Tuxford, who was sat on the roundabout was sick and collapsed while trying to recreate the stunt. He was rushed to A\u0026ampE when his eyes started to swell up and close.  His mum Dawn Hollingworth said people from as far away as Switzerland and Brazil have got in touch to offer her support after she spoke out about the stunt. She said: People have been wishing him well and asking  there is anything that can be done. Other people have said \u0027we can\u0027t watch it\u0027 and have sent messages of loveliness. Around 99% of comments that we have got have been lovely.  She said the day after the incident happened reality kicked in. She said: I wasn\u0027t so bad on the first night it happened as you just deal with it, but the next day I was an emotional wreck - reality had set in and you sit around and think \u0027what has happened?\u0027 There are lovely messages from people you have never met and I have been replying and thanking them for taking the time to care. Tyler is really grateful for the messages too and it has kept me strong at the hospital. But she said is refusing to let the minority of negative comments get her down.  After hours of examination and investigation, specialist doctors found that Tyler had sustained injuries that pilots of fighter jets usually suffer from. He was also at the potential risk of a stroke due to the pressure caused from the speed. His unusual injuries are a condition known as ‘redout’, which is brought about by extreme negative g-force. It can cause a blood flow from the lower parts of the body to the head and is considered to be potentially dangerous, as it can cause retinal damage or even a stroke in some cases. She said she hopes by speaking out about Tyler it may prevent future incidents.  She said: Just don\u0027t do it [dangerous stunts online] it may be fun for two seconds but that can turn to tragedy, so don\u0027t do it. Tyler\u0027s eyes are very painful and he has pains across his head. He is on anti inflammatory medication. He is alert and the swelling is going down but he still has blurred vision - we hope that will go when the swelling has gone. He is heading the right direction.

Cory Lloyd\u0027s son Jack developed the skin condition at just three months old, before it become so severe she stopped taking him out due to hurtful comments from strangers. The little boy, now three, suffered such severe dry and cracked patches of skin he needed to wear a special moisturising suit under his clothes virtually around the clock. But his le changed, according to his mum, after Cory was tagged in a Facebook post about skincare brand Childs Farm, tried it and saw his skin clear within a week. Play centre worker Cory, 23, from, Darwen, Lancashire, said: “I was sceptical as we had tried so many things, but literally a week after trying it, his skin was clear.  When Jack’s eczema was really bad, I had to stop taking him out as much as I wanted, as instead of enjoying our mother and baby bonding time, I’d be so conscious about people staring at him. “Once a lady said to her friend, ‘Look at that little boy, he’s had a terrible fall, his mum must not have been looking after him.’ I just went home and cried. “All people saw was a young mum and they judged me, but they weren’t there for the sleepless nights and countless hospital appointments. I was doing everything I could and getting nowhere.” Cory, who has another son, Alfie, one, with her joiner partner Ben Holmes, 23, said Jack seemed perfectly healthy until he reached three months, when crusty patches began to spring up on his forehead.  Thinking it was just standard dry skin, she applied special baby moisturiser – but it made little dference. Then, when the patches also began to weep, Cory consulted a doctor, who diagnosed eczema. “Within a couple of months, the eczema had spread all over Jack’s body,” she recalled. “I’d be coating him in moisturiser five times a day and tried so many dferent creams, steroids and antibiotics that the doctor prescribed, but nothing seemed to help. “He’d wake up every morning with blood on his sheets from where his skin had cracked in the night. “Eventually, I reached my wits end, went to the doctor and said, ‘I’m not leaving until I have a referral to a specialist.’”  Thankfully, when he was around 18 months old, Jack was referred to a dermatologist, who prescribed a special suit designed to keep moisture in and stop his clothes from absorbing the creams Cory was applying. Required to wear it every day under his clothes, it meant he did not want to play with the other children at nursery, as he knew running about would irritate his skin. In addition to the suit, Cory bandaged Jack’s legs and arms, in a bid to keep the moisture in. “I could bandage his limbs, but his torso was the worst place for eczema, she said. “It felt like sandpaper. He literally looked like a burns victim.” Desperate, Cory even asked doctors for an allergy test to see  something in Jack’s diet was triggering the agonising outbreaks – but a cause has never been found.

Great-grandparents Annette and Raymond Timmins have “fallen into depression” ever since they squandered their le savings on the legal battle over the 76cm space. The couple have been arguing with neighbour Alan Soden, 85, over a gate at the back of their neighbour’s house, which opens on to their parking area. Mr Soden threatened to take the couple to the High Court when his tenants complained the elderly pair were blocking the back gate with their car.  Outraged Mr and Mrs Timmins, aged 74 and 73, responded by erecting a fence blocking Mr Soden\u0027s gate - so he took them to court. He successfully claimed he had right of way over THEIR parking space because he\u0027d been using it before they moved in to their bungalow in Maidenhead in 2004. The tribunal judge awarded him a 76cm wide right of way through their space. But the 11-year argument cost Mr Soden a staggering \u0026pound76,000 - and the Timmins have been ordered to pay \u0026pound27,000 towards his costs, as well as their own \u0026pound45,000 legal bill.  The great-grandparents-of-ten dipped into what\u0027s left of Raymond\u0027s private pension and personal savings in order to pay the huge sum.   Now Annette and her disabled husband, claim they could be taken to court for parking on their own space - and have been left penniless by the court case. Devastated Annette said: I\u0027ve spent almost everything I have. It cost me everything. We\u0027re now in depression. We just can\u0027t believe this has happened. I have been parking on my land. But now I can be sued for parking on that 76cm space. He claimed he had a right of way and he won. If I could afford to challenge the decision then I would, but we\u0027ve been left with nothing. The Sodens, 85-year-old Alan and 78-year-old Vivien, bought their home in 1987 and have rented it out since.  Meanwhile the Timmins\u0027, who both worked in the retail industry before retirement, bought a bungalow in the same street in 2004. Both homes have their own parking spaces in a shared residential car park, about 100m from Annette\u0027s house, and backs onto the garden of Mr Soden\u0027s property. His gate opens on to her 4m side parking space, and his tenant\u0027s used the exit to get out and on to the public road - instead of walking the \u0027long way round\u0027 from the front door. Documents from the first tier land registry tribunal at the property chamber in Alfred Place, London, say they began arguing about the access in 2005 or 2007. But things deteriorated in February 2015 when a tenant living at Mr Soden\u0027s left a note on Annette\u0027s car.  The note read please don\u0027t block our gate. I don\u0027t want to scratch your car with my bike. A frustrated Annette, responded to explain that the land is in fact her property, but court papers explain how the relationship between households rapidly deteriorated. Both sides enlisted solicitors who fired letters back and forth, and in September 2015 Annette and her husband put up a FENCE over the gate. Ray told me to give it up but I wouldn\u0027t, said Annette. She added: I didn\u0027t see how we could lose and I thought it would be right to fight for what is ours. How it ended was devastating for us. I feel completely let down. It has had a terrible impact on us emotionally. A year later, in May 2016, Mr Soden applied to the Land Registry for right of way - or easement - over Annette\u0027s car parking space, because he\u0027d been using it for 20 years. The Timmins\u0027 objected - landing the argument in a tribunal court on January 2017.

Noor Nawab, from Saltley, Birmingham, claims nine-year-old Adam was left embarrassed after being singled out in front of his classmates.  The 31-year-old security worker says Adderly Primary School gave Adam the edict in front of the entire school, Birmingham Live reports.  And, he alleges, staff even made him stand up. “If there was a problem with my son’s hair, why not tell me about it or send a letter home?” said Noor.  “If they told me, I’d just ask ‘Why?’ He added: “Yes, I’m angry, but getting angry at staff gets you nowhere. He is shy and upset about it. They made him stand up in front of classmates and humiliated him.” The school says it has a clear policy on school unorm on its website. Adam has not had a haircut for years, his dad admits, and it is now beyond shoulder . “At the front, his hair is past his nose, at the back it’s beyond his shoulders,” said Noor. “It’s a fashion thing and I can’t see a problem. He has nice, long, thick hair.” He has vowed that Adam will not be visiting the barbers.  On its website, Adderley Primary describes itself as “rights respecting”. The school unorm policy states: “Whilst we respect the backgrounds, cultures and beliefs of all our families, we expect all pupils to maintain an appropriate and sensible haircut which is at the discretion of the Headteacher and School Leadership Team. “Pupils are not permitted to have any kind of patterns or lines cut into their hair. This includes ‘v’ cuts or ‘Mohican’-type styles. This also extends to patterns on eyebrows. Neither are they allowed to have articially coloured hair. It continued: “Pupils will be continually made aware of this through assemblies and ongoing school unorm monitoring by all staff. Parents will be reminded of this through newsletters and conversations with staff.

The Queen\u0027s granddaughter will wed James Brooksbank at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle at 11am on October 12. Prince Andrew was trying to strike a deal with the national broadcaster but was told it wasn\u0027t going to happen over fears it would be a ratings flop, it is reported.  A source told the Mail on Sunday: “From the outset, the instruction from the very top was that Eugenie’s wedding must be televised.  “The BBC was approached because they have a special relationship with Buckingham Palace and a formula that works. “But they turned it down because they don’t think enough people will tune in and that there isn’t enough support for the Yorks. “The feeling at the Palace is that the BBC has dropped the ball. At the end of the day, this is going to be a huge Royal Wedding, with all the senior members of the Royal Family in attendance. “But nobody wants to take the risk and spend the money it would cost to put it on air.”  It\u0027s believed Sky will only broadcast a few clips from the nuptials but ITV could step into the breach before the big day next month. Eugenie\u0027s big day is set to be a lot bigger than Prince Harry\u0027s with 850 guests invited to attend the nuptials compared to the 600 who watched him and Megan Markle tie the knot. Men will be required to wear a morning coat and women are requested to wear a dress and hat. The formal service and a lunch time reception organised by the Queen will be held on the Friday, followed by an evening party. There will then be a second celebration on the Saturday, a festival and funfair themed party at Royal Lodge - where Eugenie’s parents, the Duke and Duchess of York, still share a home despite orcing in 1996. The royal family will pay for the three parties out of their personal funds, however taxpayers will foot the bill for security, which is expected to exceed \u0026pound2million.

Marie Hinde and Jade Quayle behaved like \u0027wild animals\u0027 as they dragged her around a living room after she ed from a night out. Callie, 31, who scooped \u0026pound1.87m when she was just 16, was left with two swollen black eyes, a \u0027burst\u0027 nose, swollen lips, blurred vision, two cracked ribs, and breathing dficulties in the \u0027cowardly\u0027, unprovoked attack at then boyfriend Jack Murray\u0027s home. Her face was so badly bruised that she could not see her two youngest children for two weeks for fear of alarming them, Carlisle Crown Court heard. The photograph below shows the extent of her serious injuries. Her right eye is black and swollen shut, while the left eye is only just open. The young woman\u0027s face is obviously bruised, and blood is seen dripping from her nose down to her swollen lips. Callie\u0027s attackers were jailed on Friday.  Hinde, 38, and Quayle, 27, had been looking after Murray\u0027s dog as he went out for a night out with Callie near his home in Whitehaven, Cumbria. Mum-of-four Callie ed to the address alone in the early hours of July 2 this year after she was separated from Mr Murray, and awoke on a sofa in his living room. Tim Evans, prosecuting, said: She remembers Hinde and her partner Quayle at the living room door. They came at her and dragged her around like a rag doll. She ended up on the floor. Both of them were kicking her repeatedly to the head and body. She felt kicks to her face and stamping on her head. She cannot recall how it came to an end or the defendants\u0027 leaving so her belief is that she blacked out.  Her partner Jack came into the living room and asked what had happened. She told him it was Hinde and her partner. Callie was then taken to hospital and has to have an operation on her nose early next month, the court heard. Mr Murray confirmed he had asked the two women - who lived nearby - to look after his dog and had told them there was a key under the bin  they needed to gain access to his home. The court heard that Hinde had later told her boss at a local taxi firm, Stephen Brew, that she had \u0027battered Callie Rogers\u0027 head like a football\u0027. He asked her why she had hit someone and she laughed and said \u0027well, she laughed at me, but it went a bit far, added Mr Evans.

We know that Miss Rogers had been left bleeding in the attack. Hinde, who had 38 previous convictions for violence and multiple offences, then tried to intimidate her former boss to change his statement, warning him that she would put it on Facebook in a message to his former partner.

The Met Office warned on Friday the storm could bring hazardous conditions when it sweeps across the north of England and Wales and through the Republic of Ireland.  But the majority of Helene\u0027s strong winds are now predicted to spend themselves over the Irish Sea from Monday night and into Tuesday morning. A spokesman for the Met Office said Helene could fell a few trees, which could bring disruption to transport links, but did not think it would reach the 70mph winds originally predicted.  Those in coastal areas are warned to be wary of large waves hitting the seafront. But Helene is still due to bring unseasonably warm weather in London and the south east due as the low pressure draws up warm air from the south.  Some parts could see highs of 26C , which is 7C to 8C above average for the time of year, the Met Office said.

Rio Bailey, 25, says the disturbing effects of the drug made him hear voices in his head and turned him into a paranoid wreck, the Stoke Sentinel reported .  The once-promising athlete was introduced to the drug last year but has vowed to never take it again as he prepares for the birth of his first child. Rio, who lives in Madeley, Stoke on Trent, said: “Since I was 18 I’ve taken MDMA and cocaine, but it’s only in the last year I’ve started experimenting with monkey dust.  “I knew someone who dealt in drugs. I got told it was like cocaine but it lasts 10 times longer. I was using it for escapism and that’s the go-to drug because it lasts so long. I would say it is 10 times stronger than coke. “There’s a euphoria to it. I’m fully aware of what I was doing when I’ve taken it, but you’ve got so much energy you just want to keep moving.  “It’s highly mentally addictive. You can start hearing voices with it. “It’s like any drug though - how it affects you depends on the person taking it.”  Staffordshire Police has revealed officers have dealt with 950 incidents associated with the drug in just three months. Meanwhile paramedics say they are regularly called to deal with users who have taken the substance, which can be bought on the streets of Stoke-on-Trent for as little as \u0026pound2. Rio said he was surprised by the number of people that were taking it, and believes it is so popular because it\u0027s so cheap. He said: “You smoke it, and it costs a couple of quid for a hit. “I would go two months without taking it, then go on a bender for a week. I’ve got anger issues and when that got triggered I would take it. “Dealers will give people their first hit for free, just so they can get people hooked. It’s so cheap.” Rio was a keen athlete before going to Manchester politan University to study sports management. He found it too expensive to continue to compete, but graduated with a degree and moved back to the area when he was 22. Monkey Dust, also known as MDPV, causes hallucinations and paranoia. People on the drug, which looks like an off-white powder, have been known to climb trees and buildings and attack people who come near them. It\u0027s from a family of drugs known as cathinones as can be bought for as little as \u0026pound2. Monkey dust can be swallowed, injected or snorted and it dampens perceptions of pain. It can also cause powerful hallucinations which lead to severe paranoia. The use of monkey dust is on the rise because of its low cost and its effects can be felt after ingesting small amounts - as little as 3mg. While Staffordshire is a known epicentre for the drug, West Midlands Ambulance Service said it has dealt with cases across the region. Paramedics have been called to 178 incidents since April involving money dust — 131 of them in North Staffordshire.    Now, he is due to become a dad in three months, and says that has been the catalyst that\u0027s made him want to change his ways. He said: “I’m not going to take it again. It would be selfish  I did, with a kid on the way. “If I was giving advice to someone thinking of taking it, I would say don’t. It’s not going to resolve any issues you have, when you come down from it your issues are going to be ten times worse.” Rio’s dad, Baz Bailey, said seeing the effect monkey dust had on his son was ‘heartbreaking’. The 48-year-old dad-of-four said: “At one stage he would be okay, then just go missing for a fortnight.

Joanne ‘Jojo’ Capestro managed to escape the World Trade Center’s North Tower just moments before it collapsed on September 11 2001. She had no idea acclaimed photographer Phil Penman had captured the poignant moment she and a shell shocked colleague - coated in thick white dust - staggered away from Ground Zero. But the pair finally met after Penman’s harrowing photos were displayed inside the National September 11 Memorial \u0026amp Museum. And last month, 17 years after they were first linked by the worst attack on US soil, he took the photos as she married the love of her le Robert Vasquez.  She said: “Phil was with me on the best day of my le and the worst day of my le.” Joanne, then an assistant secretary for the May Davis Group, had been working on the 87th floor when hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 plunged into the high rise six floors above. “That was a regular day for me, when I woke up in the morning I didn’t feel well, but I still went to work,” recalled Joanne. “And I was standing at my desk with one of my co-workers because we were going to go downstairs. But the phone rang and he answered, then the plane hit five or six floors above us. “The impact was so strong and the building was shaking until all of a sudden it stopped.”  They soon found two of the three stairwell exits were “melting” and unusable from the crash. Fortunately, a third was passable. She was forced to flee down 87 flights of stairs to escape - all within 22 minutes. She was only a few steps outside the tower when it began to collapse, causing Joanne and her colleagues to run for their lives screaming “God help me”. At some point while trying to escape from the horric scene, she was unknowingly photographed by Penman. In the gripping image she is barefoot, carrying her heels and handbag in a street plastered with toxic dust. The photographer and his subject were finally introduced three years ago by staff at the museum who recognised Joanne in the picture.

Especially slap bang in the middle of bustling central London. And although Aldwych tube station  has been disused for almost 40 years, there are thought to be a few guests lurking in the shadows. And I’ve been sent to try and contact them. Luckily, I’m joined by professional ghostbusters, best friends Nick Groff and Katrina Weidman, who have been spending the night in haunted houses across America for over 14 years. Their new series, Paranormal Lockdown, sees them visiting England’s most spooky spots, with Aldwych station first on their list. The premise? They stay for at least one night in haunted locations. ‘At home, we only visit residences that have a history spanning about 300 years, tops,’ explains Katrina. ‘In England the history is fascinating, and we picked up so much more than we expected.’ The station itself is smaller than most. It only had two platforms and two tracks, and was opened in 1907 purely to take passengers to and from an increasingly popular theatre, The Royal Strand that was situated nearby. During the Second World War it was used as an air-raid shelter and held 2,500 people. Notably, it also held treasures from Buckingham Palace, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Elgin Marbles.  One of the tube tunnels runs directly under a site where something rather gruesome was uncovered. In the 1830s a man was charging people money to bury their loved ones at a local church but what he was actually doing was dumping the corpses in a 6ft-deep, 60ft-wide pit. Twenty years later, 12,000 bodies were found after the congregation complained of a foul smell and strange insects flying around. As well as ghosts from the graveyard being reported by ex workers and security, people have also said they’ve seen a woman dressed in theatrical costumes thought to be the ghost of Francis Maria Kelly. She was the star of a one-woman show at the Royal Strand Theatre in the late 1800s and is said to haunt the station in sorrow, devastated because they closed the theatre and put an end to her career. Other sightings include a man in unorm who is thought to be a staff member who died on the tracks. Some people have smelt strong perfume or cigarette smoke and others have heard loud operatic singing echoing along the tracks. I meet Nick and Katrina outside the station. They’re armed with cameras and a huge ‘telephone to the dead’ .   Screaming Roxanne Pallett threatens to quit THIRD TV show after Celebrity Big Brother scandal  They also pull out from the ‘ghost kit’ a flat, motion detecting light panel which they’ll position on the platform edge in the hope of picking up any swooshing shadowy figures. One hundred and ninety-three winding, creaking steps lead us down to the damp, cold depths of the station. With a torch each, we finally turn the corner onto one of the platforms where stands, ominously, a disused tube train, doors wide open, with the seats full of dust. As one platform was closed off shortly after the war, the posters that line the walls are all promoting the war effort, calling women to recycle their dresses and asking commuters to save their kitchen waste for the farm animals. When the tunnel was used as an air-raid shelter, the ceilings were painted in a lead-based paint to help protect the rare artefacts that were stored there from being damaged by damp. Because of this, and the way in which it was abandoned, the platform is perfectly preserved and is now a listed area. Although some of the posters are peeling at the corners, it’s like stepping into a time capsule. It gave me chills, but nothing fazes Nick and Katrina, and they are keen to get stuck in. Nick explains that they’ve had great success with the ‘telephone to the dead’, including a couple of clear, intelligent conversations that have gone on for over an hour. In an American prison, an inmate told them her name, her crime, her sentence, and it made the pair want to cry. Electronic voice phenomenon, as it’s called, was founded in the 70s after researchers discovered spooky secret messages when picking up static and other background noises. Often it can only be heard  slowed right down, but in some cases, it’s as clear as day. And, today, we’re in luck.  We bundle onto one of the carriages and, although it is large and empty, it’s clear we are not alone. They switch on the device, and I immediately get goosebumps. We hear a loud, echoing, Cockney male voice clearly shouting ‘hello’ at us. On the opposite end of the scale, we hear an old-fashioned sounding whisper from a female. Polite, curious and sweet. The two voices couldn’t be more dferent. Nick calls out, ‘Can you try and talk to us?’ We hear the woman whisper, ‘What is it?’ followed by the word ‘actress’. Nick tries to explain that  she uses our energy to speak, we can hear her voice through the machine. Innocently, she asks ‘How does it work?’   A historian named Alan Brooke then joins us on our hunt to validate any names and places we pick up, and both spirits seem eager to  talk to him, despite him hanging back from the investigation. Both voices say his name multiple times, so he nervously walks onto the carriage with us.  Talking over each other in a desperate attempt to speak to the historian, the female voice asks, ‘Do you remember me?’ and ‘What year is it?’ while the male voice is trying to communicate something about a head injury and asked  anyone ‘is a medic’. Alan explains to us that the man who died on the tracks suffered a large head injury. None of us can quite believe what we’re hearing. Suddenly, a bitter coldness surrounds us and my chest feels heavy. Katrina explains that it’s common to feel tight-chested and have breathing dficulties when a lot of spirit activity is around, because they use your energy to connect more clearly.  Interestingly, as the pair ask the ghosts to use our energy, my dictaphone stops working. As do a few cameras and torches. ‘This always happens,’ explains Nick. The stronger the connection gets the more we lose our power supplies. Even fully charged batteries can die in minutes.’ And the connection is getting even stronger. Nick and Katrina are so delighted to pick up such clear voices that they seem to think the ghosts might be able to manest and show themselves to us, something I am without a doubt not ready for. We don’t see any shadows, but I certainly sense a presence. That feeling of someone staring at you from across a room even though you haven’t made eye contact. The way you just know someone is stood behind you. I feel the air move next to me as though someone has just walked past. Yes, your mind plays tricks on you in the dark, but the sense of being watched is unsettling. Especially as the ghosts seem to know exactly who we are – they say all our names over the course of the investigation. The ghosthunters wanted someone to head to the driver’s carriage – alone – so I volunteer. As I anxiously wait for instruction from Nick and Katrina, a shivering cold and a heavy atmosphere take hold. The male voice appears to be trying to scare me by taunting, ‘Don’t go in there,’ and shouting ‘Danger!’ the second I closed the door. The ghosthunters explain that spirits often try to spook people out, but remind me, ‘It’s only the living that are able to hurt us.’ And they are right – I leave to rejoin the group unharmed.  In an attempt to spur on more activity, Nick tries to rile up the male presence. We hear the voice clearly telling us to ‘shut up’ and he then swears at us, followed by an almighty sigh.

A passenger on a Ryanair flight from Ibiza to Madrid filmed the thief in action before alerting an air steward.  Police got the man to confess before ing the stolen item back to its rightful owner - a teenage boy travelling to the Spanish capital with his mum. The baggage handler, who worked for the airport not Ryanair - is now facing trial and had only started his job three days earlier. He is thought to have been sacked.   Footage of his crime - published by island paper Diario de Ibiza - showed him opening the case on a luggage trolley before rooting around inside with one hand and then putting the red speaker in his left trouser pocket.  The extraordinary incident happened on Friday morning.

Paracetamol is recommended by the NHS to treat most kinds of childhood ailments, including headache, stomach ache, ear ache, and cold symptoms, while it can also be used to reduce fever.  The UK\u0027s leading brand is Calpol. But researchers say children given paracetamol in their first two years of le may be at greater risk of asthma by adulthood, especially  they have a particular genetic makeup.  The research, carried out at the University of Melbourne, Australia, looked at 620 children who had been followed from birth to 18-years-old as part of the Melbourne Atopy Cohort Study. The research showed the link between paracetamol use and asthma seemed strongest in those who had a particular iant of the glutathione S-transferase  gene, GSTP1. But the study authors stressed that the findings showed only that there was an association between paracetamol and asthma - not that paracetamol caused the lung condition.   The 620 children had been recruited to the study before they were born because they were considered to be potentially at high risk of developing an allergy-related disease as they had at least one family member  with a self-reported allergic disease eczema , hay fever or a severe food allergy.  After their birth, a research nurse rang the family every four weeks for the first 15 months, and then at 18 months and at two-years-old to ask how many days in the previous weeks had the child taken paracetamol. When the children were 18-years-old they gave a blood or saliva sample, which was tested for iants of the GST genes: GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1. They were also assessed for asthma, and a spirometry test was performed to measure the amount of air inhaled and exhaled when breathing through a mouthpiece. Researchers found one iant of the GSTP1 gene - GSTP1 Ile/Ile  is inherited from both parents - was associated with almost twice the risk of developing asthma.  Xin Dai, a nurse and PhD student at the university, said: We found that children with the GSTP1 Ile/Ile iant had 1.8 times higher risk of developing asthma by the age of 18 years for each doubling of the days of paracetamol exposure when compared to children who were less exposed. In contrast, increasing paracetamol exposure in children who had other types of GSTP1 did not alter the risk of asthma. We also found effects in children who had a iant of GSTM1 in which one part is not ing. In these children increasing paracetamol use was associated with small, but signicant reduction in the amount of air they could forcibly breathe out in one second at 18 years. Our findings provide more evidence that paracetamol use in infancy may have an adverse effect on respiratory health for children with particular genetic profiles and could be a possible cause of asthma.

Flower headdresses and suspenders were among the items party-goers donned at the Defqon.1 festival in Sydney, Australia. Some decorated their bodies and faces with paint, while others went for masks, wigs and fancy dress costumes. Many women were pictured in bikinis and men in swim shorts. People were photographed enjoying themselves with groups of friends, but the event ended in tragedy.   Two people died, a dozen more were taken to hospital and hundreds others sought medical assistance after suspected drug overdoses at a music festival in Sydney, the police said.  A 23-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman died on Saturday after collapsing at the Defqon.1 festival, the police said. Two of the 13 hospitalised people remain in critical condition, while about 700 sought assistance on site.  The police has charged 10 people with drug supply offences, including two teenagers who allegedly carried 120 capsules to the festival, held at the Sydney International Regatta Centre.   I\u0027m absolutely aghast at what has occurred, I don\u0027t want any family to go through the tragedy that some families are waking up to this morning, it\u0027s just horrible to think about, the premier of the Australian state of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian , said.   This is an unsafe event and I\u0027ll be doing everything I can to make sure it never happens again, she added. Ms Berejuklian denied cancelling the event would force it and others to go underground, and said pill-testing at music events was not a solution. Anyone who advocates pill-testing is giving the green light to drugs. There is no such thing as a safe drug and unfortunately when young people think there is, it has tragic consequences, she said. In 2013 and 2015, two men in their 20s died while attending the festival, both of suspected drug overdose.  The festival, an annual event held in Australia since 2009, has been organised by Q-Dance Australia, part of the Dutch event organiser Q-Dance. On Sunday, the organisers said they were deeply saddened by the deaths. We are disappointed at the number of reported drug-related incidents, we have a zero-tolerance policy in relation to drug use at the festival, Defqon.1 said in a statement published by the Sydney Morning Herald. In total, 69 people were found in possession of drugs at the festival held at Sydney International Regatta Centre.  Local detectives have formed a new police strikeforce, dubbed Highworth, to investigate the two deaths. About 30,000 revellers attended this year\u0027s event. New South Wales Police Acting Assistant Commissioner, Allan Sicard, said police had done everything they could to ensure the event was safe.  What we can\u0027t do is be in people\u0027s heads, be in people\u0027s decision-making processes when they decide to take illicit drugs, he said, according to ABC.  Police can only do so much.

The Buk missile was built at a plant near Moscow during the Cold War and delivered to Ukraine in 1986 when it was a Soviet republic, the Kremlin claims. A team of international investigators has pointed the blame at Moscow, saying videos and other evidence show a missile launcher being secretly transported into territory held by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The investigators claim a Russian-made Buk missile brought down the jet and the launcher used in the air disaster - which killed all 298 passengers and crew onboard - belonged to Russia\u0027s military.  But Russia\u0027s Ministry of Defence claims those videos have been manipulated, and denies claims that Moscow was involved in the July 2014 tragedy of the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. At a news conference on Monday, Russia\u0027s military provided an audio recording which it claims is proof that Ukraine was involved in the air disaster. It claims that the missile used to bring down the jet was no longer in its hands.  Russian officials claim serial numbers found on missile fragments show the weapon was built in 1986 and it was owned by Ukraine when the jet was shot down. General Nikolay Parshin told reporters that the missile was sent to Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic military unit 20152, which is now the 223rd anti-aircraft defence regiment of Ukraine\u0027s armed forces. The general claims that unit was involved in Ukraine\u0027s offensive against Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk region in June 2014, just weeks before the airliner was shot down.  In May, the international team of investigators, led by the Netherlands, said Russia\u0027s armed forces supplied the missile launcher that fired a Russian-made Buk missile at MH17 over the war zone. Wilbert Paulissen, head of the Netherlands\u0027 national police crime squad, said the missile was fired from Russia\u0027s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Moscow is not involved in that investigation, and claims the probe is biased.

A desperate rescue mission was launched after the landslide destroyed the miners\u0027 bunkhouses at a hillside camp in the town of Itogon, but there were fears no-one would be found alive. At least seven bodies have been recovered and about 40 people were still believed to be trapped by the disaster which brought 200mph winds and torrential rain. Mangkhut killed at least 65 people in the Philippines after making landfall on Saturday as the world\u0027s strongest storm of 2018.  The Category 5 storm triggered dozens of landslides, brought down trees and power lines, tore apart homes and flooded villages before moving on towards Hong Kong and southern China. About a quarter of the estimated 4.2 million people affected by Saturday\u0027s storm in the Philippines live in poverty, and the United Nations estimated about 1.4 million farmers and 100,000 fishermen were hit by the typhoon, Reuters reported. Its 200mph winds were stronger than those of Hurricane Florence, which has killed at least 17 people after slamming into the US East Coast.  Known as Typhoon Ompong locally, Mangkhut was the 15th storm to hit the Philippines this year. Philippine authorities had said they were better prepared than in 2013, when Typhoon Haiyan devastated central areas of the country and killed 6,300 people. Meanwhile, Mangkhut was downgraded to a tropical storm after wreaking havoc in Hong Kong and southern China on Sunday.

Everyone was waving and I felt like a celebrity for a while.”Jasmine and Paul’s younger sister Sophie, 2, acted as flower girls with Paul’s sisters Jill Wilson and Abby Holmes as bridesmaids.Paul’s brother Craig was his best man and during his speech he gave the couple a wedding present they will never forget.Paul said: “When Craig was giving his speech he told Sheenagh and I to close our eyes.“He told a story about how he had forgotten to get us a wedding gt until a drunken night in Ayia Napa.“The whole room erupted in laughter and when we opened our eyes he was showing off a tattoo saying ‘Congratulations Mr and Mrs Wilson’ with the wedding date.”Sheenagh added: “It was never going to be a normal wedding.”It wasn’t the last time Craig was the centre of attention, because when his partner Kirsty Robertson caught Sheenagh’s bouquet he looked less than impressed.Paul captured it all on camera and since it was uploaded to YouTube the video has generated more than 29,000 views.The couple and their 20 guests danced the night away to their DJs Mark and Gail who were “amazing” and kept everyone entertained until late.The celebrations continued as it was Jasmine’s birthday just two days later.But disaster struck when Paul went swimming and lost his wedding ring in the sea.He was lucky that laid-back Sheenagh was still excited following the nuptials and the trip didn’t end in a record-breaking orce.Once the couple ed home, family and friends were invited to a party at the Rose Function Suite at Gulistan House.Sheenagh and Paul would like to say thank you to everyone who made it to Cyprus and their home party.Sheenagh added: “The past eight weeks have been a whirlwind but it was the best time of my le.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9b902a01761.jpg ","title":"dundee united new boy booth says he shouldnt have tried to run off injury","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCallum Booth admits had he been a Dundee United veteran instead of a rookie, two months into the season Arabs would have seen a lot more of him than they have.The 27-year-old is ready for today’s Championship clash with Morton at Tannadice and,  he completes the 90 minutes, it will be the first time since his debut in mid-July.That’s when he damaged ankle ligaments in the Betfred Cup defeat at Ross County, an injury suffered early on in the tie.It could have forced him off immediately but the fact he played on was, he admits, a mistake on his part that was caused by him being new to the team.“Firstly, it’s been good to be back, obviously being out for five weeks was a long time,” said the former Partick Thistle defender.“It felt like ages, especially when you join a new club because you just want to make good impressions and get games under your belt right away.“It was my ankle, I did in it in the first half at Ross County and quite stupidly played on.“The physio came on, had a look and I thought I could probably run it off. I did feel it for the rest of the game but being at a new club you just want to show up well in your first game.“If I’d been here a couple of years I would have come off but, because it was my first game, I stayed on and probably made it worse – I woke up the next day and it was agony.“The result was five weeks out and that wasn’t ideal but it’s in the past now and I’m raring to go.”What he isn’t doing is expecting to walk right back into the team and he knows, in the shape of fellow left-back Jamie Robson, he’s facing strong competition for that defensive berth.“Jamie has been doing really well, he’s a good player and it’s good to have competition. There are a few boys still out and they’re coming back, so there’s going to be even more and that can only be good for the squad.“I feel that, when we have everyone fit, we have a very strong squad and it’s just going to be a case of getting everyone fit and keeping it that way. There are always injuries, though, it’s part and parcel of football.”His mission now is to help however he can as United look to keep picking up points to mount a strong promotion challenge.The aim today is to pick up three points. He knows that will not be easy against a Morton side who will be something of an unknown quantity after their recent change of manager.It saw ex-United boss Ray McKinnon quit after just three months in chare to take over at Falkirk and former Rangers star Jonatan Johansson replace him.“Any team that gets a new manager, they usually take a couple of weeks to implement what the new man is trying to do. This is Johansson’s first game in charge so we are not really too sure how they’ll set up.“One thing we know is they have good inidual players and experience in there as well in the middle of the park.“It’s going to be a tough game and they are a good side. They’ve had a good couple of seasons where they’ve always been in or close to the play-offs and done well in a few cups.”For United the aim is to build on a three-game unbeaten run that’s seen seven points taken from the last nine, though Booth believes it should have been a full house.“We are going not too bad but,  we want to be winning the league, we have to be holding on to results like the one we should have had at Alloa last time out.“We didn’t play great but 1-0 going into the last 10 minutes, we should have seen the game out. Still, seven points from the last nine after a tricky start to the season is not too bad.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9bdfd048c4b-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"ray mckinnon dundee tried to punt ex captain darren odea to falkirk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew Falkirk manager Ray McKinnon has revealed the deadline day madness at the Championship strugglers – and even had a Dundee defender offered to him with just minutes to go till the window slammed shut.The former Dundee United boss was only in the door for a few hours after his shock switch from Greenock Morton.McKinnon managed to seal a deal for Rangers striker Zak Rudden on loan but narrowly missed out on former Tannadice loanee Anthony Ralston.He also revealed Dundee boss Neil McCann offered the services of former skipper Darren O’Dea as the clock ticked towards midnight.McKinnon said: “We had Darren O’Dea getting punted to us at 10.30 at night by Neil McCann.

We’ve been rehearsing and have just played at the Glenfiddich Festival Experiment so we’re on a roll. We can’t wait to play for everyone.”Dundee two-piece St Martiins are next up, performing a set at 12.40pm. Featuring Katie Lynch and Mark Johnston, they claim to have crafted a “unique sound” through music “laced with dark tones”.Katie said: “The V\u0026ampA is bringing something new to the creative scene here in Dundee, which has been needing a good refresh.

Today’s going to be great – we’re so happy that we were asked.”At 1.30pm is Andrew Wasylyk, the alias of Dundee writer and producer Andrew Mitchell.He describes his work as being “cinematic nostalgia” with “elements of Baroque pop and the influence of classic 1970s songwriters”. Andrew said: “It’s a privilege to be involved and to play a small part in the opening of this new chapter for the city. I’m a fan of Kengo Kuma’s architecture and I’m excited to see the V\u0026ampA evolve and grow with the local communities. I’m really looking forward to performing with a nine-piece ensemble.”Kyle Falconer  – frontman of The View – is the most familiar name on the bill and he will appear on-stage at 2.30pm. The Dryburgh lad has been on tour promoting his debut solo album No Thank You of late, and is expected to perform hits from that LP along with a few well-known tunes from the band that made him famous.Another familiar face appears at 3.30pm in Be Charlotte  – the stage name of local singer Charlotte Brimner.She continues to make a name for herself, having signed a record deal earlier this year and performed last night before Primal Scream on the first day of the 3D Festival.Rounding the day off will be Danny Wilson icon Gary Clark, who’ll play a solo set to his hometown from 4.30pm before being joined by Sistema – the children’s schools orchestra – at 4.50pm to bring the festival to a close. Gary found fame with hits like Mary’s Prayer – which is expected to get an outing today.Organisers say the festival is all-standing and entry is via two gates on Thomson Avenue.Those attending aren’t allowed to take food or drink but outlets will be available.There will be a host of other activities taking place at Slessor Gardens, including a special event involving The Beano – where children can complete a comic cell in an attempt to break a world record.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/VA-Dundee-promo.jpg ","title":"va dundee huge queue as museum opens to wider public after debut weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA large queue of eager visitors has formed as people aim to get their first glimpse of the V\u0026ampA Dundee.After a weekend of celebrations and exclusive access to lucky ballot winners, the museum opened its doors to the general public.The iconic building officially opened at 10am today.\u0026mdash Mary\u0026#39sChapelProject  September 17, 2018Shortly after the opening time, a large queue had formed \u0026#8211 stretching past the RRS Discovery.The iconic £80 million museum welcomed thousands of visitors over Saturday and Sunday.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0027 historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0027 committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0027 financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0027 a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Monday 17 Sep 2018 11:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117443.jpg","title":"Family support group lends a helping hand","story":"\u0026nbspTHE family of a Black Isle father-of-three who took his own le after he struggled to cope with depression believe they are now helping others to handle their grief.More than 80 people so far have attended Patrick and Wendy Mullery\u0027 suicide support group, which was founded in memory of their son James.The 28-year-old car salesman died last October.The Mullerys, of Bayview Crescent, Cromarty, together with James\u0027 long-term partner Jodie, who is the mother of his three children, run the monthly meet-up at Mercure Inverness Hotel, paying the heavily-discounted room hire cost out of their own pockets.Mr Mullery , a commercial waste manager for Highland Waste Services in Invergordon, said he was surprised at the group\u0027 high turnout, which is now gearing up for its sixth session.\"It\u0027 more than we expected which just shows there is a need,\" he said.\"People come along and just share their experiences.

Tony Watt was lurking unmarked at the back post for a cross but Andy Considine cut it out with a last gasp clearance for a corner.Aberdeen were looking vulnerable down the flanks and were also offering very little in terms of attack.It was grim viewing for the travelling Red Army.In the 31st minute Saints again threatened when Blair Aston sent a 15 yard glancing header along the face of goal and wide.A first shot of note on target from the Dons finally came in the 35th minute when Gleeson released Logan down the right flank with a cross-field ball.That was the only real effort from the Dons in a grim first 45 minutes for the Pittodrie side.McInnes changed it at half-time by bringing on striker Sam Cosgrove for Forrester.Within a minute of the restart McGinn was denied when his powerful 22 yard drive was pushed wide by keeper Clark.Winger Mackay-Steven injected real urgency when he picked up the ball on the right and cut across into a more central position.He unleashed a vicious 20 yard drive that Jason Kerr headed off the line with the keeper beaten.Moments later Shinnie fired a low drive wide from the edge of the box.Aberdeen did more in attack in the first five minutes of the second half than in the entire first 45 minutes.Keeper Clark did well to get down and block a low drive from Mackay-Steven at his near post.The Dons were denied in the 62nd minute when substitute Cosgrove latched onto a cross 12 yards out delivered by Logan.Cosgrove headed downwards but was denied by a superb save from Clark.Aberdeen were vastly improved in the second half and were running rampant.The goal the Dons second half play merited finally arrived in the 69th minute via a superb free-kick from McGINN.The winger lted a 19 yard effort up over the defensive wall and beyond the ing Clark into the top corner for a deserved equaliser.Moments later Joe Lewis saved a powerful drive from Blair Alston.

Seven players were out injured for the trip to Perth, with Mikey Devlin suspended.McInnes said: “Not many teams outwith the Old Firm could maybe cope with our level of injuries.“We have eight players out with suspensions and injuries.“Probably four or five of them would be starting for me.“When you take all that into consideration, a point at McDiarmid Park isn’t the worst result but it was still three points we were looking for.”Out injured are Mark Reynolds, Tommie Hoban, Scott Wright, James Wilson, Frank Ross, Lewis Ferguson and Greg Tansey.Centre-back Mikey Devlin was suspended after the SFA fast-track appeals’ panel rejected a bid to have his red card against Kilmarnock overturned.Aberdeen were dealt another blow when Scotland Under-21 international Lewis Ferguson sustained an injury in training.He was ruled out 24 hours before kick-off with a knee injury and is doubtful to face Motherwell on Saturday.McInnes said: “Lewis took a knock in training in a clash of knees with Dean Campbell.“We didn’t think anything of it but on Friday he reported with a wee bit of fluid on it.“So got it checked out and unfortunately he missed the St Johnstone game.“He will be a doubt for this weekend but probably not more than that.“Again, that didn’t help matters as he brings that presence and added dig that we missed in the first half.“Hopefully, he is okay as he has been terric.”The Dons gaffer hopes the injury problems will alleviate partially ahead of the clash with the Steelmen.He said: “Hopefully we will get a couple back.“We will certainly get Devlin back for next week and maybe James Wilson.”Aberdeen were denied two penalty calls in the draw by ref Willie Collum for challenges on Stevie May and Gary Mackay-Steven.The penalty call on Mackay-Steven came in injury time from a challenge by Blair Austin.McInnes said: “The referee is in a very good position.“Gary is adamant that he has come through and touched his foot to get to the ball.“My first thought is it was a penalty but when you are the manager that is always your first thought when it is your team.“Whether it is a penalty or not it is a close call.“By and large, the referee got the majority of things right.”Aberdeen trailed at half-time after a flat opening 45 minutes in Perth.However, they signicantly upped their levels to secure a draw via a free- kick from Niall McGinn.McInnes said: “We played far more aggressively in the second- half and with a lot more intent.“The players deserve a lot more credit as at 1-0 down the onus was on us to get something from the game.“We had to step things up and played at a good pace and tempo in the second-half with far more aggression.“Whether we deserved to win would be up for debate but the least we deserved was a point and it was a good bit of quality from McGinn.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen firm raises more than 1000 for city charities","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen firm has raised more than £10,000 for charitable causes.Johnson Carmichael Accountants and Business Advisers in Aberdeen has been fundraising for two local charities.A total of £10,531 has been raised this year.It will go towards Maggie’s Centres, with £5,156 donated to the charity.The money will be used to fund the centres for two days, which will help to provide vital support for those who have been diagnosed with cancer and their families.A further £5,375 has been given to the Rubislaw Ward at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital – where parents go when they have lost a baby during pregnancy.That cash will be used to purchase a memory tree for the ward, allowing parents who have lost a child to engrave the tree with their child’s name.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hub goes back to the future with 4k boost","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA community hub has pledged more than £4,000 of free accommodation a year to a social enterprise in an effort to support their services.Inchgarth Community Centre has committed to providing permanent free access to Future Choices to run its services, which will save the group around £4,500 annually.The charity, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary, aims to reduce social isolation for adults with disabilities by hosting recreational events alongside other adults who have additional needs.Paul O’Connor, manager of the centre and chairman of Garthdee Community Council, said: “Our long-term commitment and support allows the charity to concentrate on what’s most important – helping their members who are some of the city’s most socially isolated people where Future Choices is their leline, social outlet and place of friendship.“So, to support these two campaigns, this is our commitment to Future Choices.“They will receive permanent long-term free access at £4,500 per year, and the sponsorship to give their members monthly entertainment with Inchgarth picking up the tab.”Chairman David Forbes, who founded the charity in 2008, said: “When I heard, I burst into tears and was speechless.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience.

Now, with funding from another Spanish organisation, Africa Directo, the science block has been built and ZamScotEd is committed to completing the interior and providing the furniture and equipment.\u0026#8217Marian added that Manos Unidas have just agreed to fund the fourth and final classroom block.There are now 190 pupils at the school, which is run by ZamScotEd\u0026#8217s Zambian partners, the Teresian Sisters, and there are 95 boys and 95 girls.\u0026#8216Our aims are to meet three of the UN\u0026#8217s sustainable development goals,\u0026#8217 Marian continued. \u0026#8216Goal number four is quality education, and head teacher Sr Veronica Nyoni and her team  are achieving that.\u0026#8216Goal number five is gender equality – and we\u0026#8217re spot on there. These two can lead to Goal number one, which is to eliminate poverty. If these youngsters get a good education that leads to worthwhile employment, they will be able to turn around their own communities.\u0026#8217Every penny from events like ZamScotEd\u0026#8217s coffee mornings goes to enhance the school and the lives of these Zambia children.Marian concluded: \u0026#8216ZamScotEd can\u0026#8217t thank our community here enough.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the best of music food and festival fun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 14/09/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSet in the stunning grounds of Inveraray Castle, Best of the West is a firm favourite in the Scottish festival calendar.People of all ages came to enjoy the three-day celebration of the best in music, food, drink, arts and crafts \u0026#8211 and family fun.The weather gods were mercul for the Friday September 7 opening, featuring big crowds and a cracking atmosphere in anticipation of a great weekend of entertainment.And, the odd heavy Sunday shower aside , the weather stayed fine for the whole event.For the kids there was face painting \u0026#8211 also surprisingly popular among mildly lubricated adults \u0026#8211 as well as the ever popular climbing wall, dancing teacups and much more.Top-notch fare in the Food from Argyll tent proved as big a draw as it does every year, while local artists showcased a myriad of crafts and artwork in their own popular marquee.Top chefs from award-winning restaurants showed off their skills in the Festival Kitchen, including Calum Hall, head chef at Loch Fyne Oysters, Samphire chef and owner Andrew MacLugash  and Masterchef 2016 winner Gary MacLean.With 24 bands performing across the two stages, this was a real musical treat in relaxed surroundings.Music and the amber nectar poured from the Whisky tent in a mellow blend of conviviality. Mid Argyll\u0026#8217s Bar None Community Choir were excellent, as were duo Holly Renton from Inveraray and Lochgilphead\u0026#8217s Tiegan Holroyd bringing their soft, melodic tones to the festival once again.The big hitters were on the main stage. Former Runrig frontman Donnie Munro delighted audience members of a certain age with songs old and new on Saturday evening. At the opposite end of the experience spectrum, Cowal outfit Heron Valley showed why they are currently home in between US tours.The energetic Celtic sound of American band Seven Nations had the Friday night joint jumping ahead of Tide Lines, lead singer Robert Robertson all blue eyes and boundless energy.Arguably the Saturday show was stolen by the colour, noise and drama of the Bhangra Beatles \u0026#8211 with Fab Four favourites handed an Indian twist of spice.Argyll acts held their own and more among illustrious company. The Camans, Rhuvaal, Dr Hip and the Blues Operation and Ri Cheile put on cracking performances.The whole thing was rounded off with a bang by Trad supergroup Skipinnish.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust. The next championships will be held at Inveralmond Community High School, Livingston, on Sunday March 10 2019.More details are on our website \u0026#8211 www.thechampionships.Last March, 145 schools from Scotland and two from England were represented at the championships, with a category for all standards of playing.Five years ago we introduced a new category of \u0026#8216freestyle\u0026#8217.  The aim of this is to provide an opportunity for schools to showcase their other musical skills alongside those of their pipers.The Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust  hopes many young pipers and drummers from Mid Argyll \u0026#8211 with other musicians too  entering the freestyle event – will participate in next year’s championships.Patrick Gascoigne, administrator, Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13243376.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_lhr_ayp_260418funky.jpg","title":"ayrshire clubbers could tv club","story":"NewsAyrshire clubbers could be on TV with Club MTV filmingMTV have launched a new channel - Club MTV - that films at the best clubs across the country.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet11:58, 14 SEP 2018NewsFurys nighclub in Ayr \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailClubbers in Ayrshire will have the chance to show off their moves to the world.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her le now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a orced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no le, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my le was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horric surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year.

Jockey Oisin Murphy has made this year his own, riding the crest of the proverbial wave to land another Group 1 victory. It was always the worry that enigmatic HARRY ANGEL would lose his race in the stalls which he sadly did. It was a proper thrill to watch last years Arc winner ENABLE  to the track after a y absence with a decisive victory over CRYSTAL OCEAN. The John Gosden trained filly is now as short as 9/4 to retain her crown at Longchamp on October 7. With five Group 1 victories to her name you have to fancy her chances. For most of us the daily commute to work is no more hazardous than the annoyance of a late bus or a car that won’t start. Few will use a single engine plane or helicopter. It may look glamorous from the outside but for top trainers and jockeys who are engaged at two tracks on the same day it is an essential form of transport. The perils involved were highlighted on Saturday when trainer Richard Hannon’s plane collided with another on landing at a rain sodden Haydock. Mercully the only damage was to the clipped wings of the aircraft. Lets not always envy those who look as though they are living the high le. The climax to four days of racing at Doncaster comes this Saturday at 3:35pm in the final Classic of the season. Early in the week Aidan O’Brien’s KEW GARDENS was a rock solid favourite at 5/4 with LAH TI DAR  a remote second. The money has come for the Andrew Lloyd-Webber owned filly who is now favourite at 15/8 while KEW GARDENS can be backed at 2/1. LAH TI DAR  is three wins from three starts. The latest of which, the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at York’s Ebor Festival, was a 10  rout.  In the St Leger fillies are in receipt of a 3lb weight allowance against the colts in this 1 mile 6 marathon. It is a race that John Gosden excels in  having won it four times previously. Connections are confident the step up in trip will suit her strong galloping style and that any ease in the ground will suit the daughter of DUBAWI. With just one race this summer she should arrive at post on Saturday fresh as a daisy. In contrast this will be KEW GARDENS\u0027 fth engagement of the campaign. One we like and who has stamina in abundance is KEW GARDENS\u0027 stablemate SOUTHERN FRANCE at 14/1. Lightly raced, this son of GALLILEO has caught the eye on more than one occasion despite running a touch green in second behind KEW GARDENS in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot. SOUTHERN FRANCE  looks the value each way bet. In a tactical race he may be up in the vanguard keeping LAH TI DAR honest, forcing a true gallop. If there is a flaw to be found in the new favourite as she steps up in trip and in to Group 1 company for the first time, SOUTHERN FRANCE will be sure to find it.

urgent call was made at the beginning of July to collect the money in just two months.\nAnd on Thursday, August 30, thanks to the efforts of hundreds of people, companies in Tweeddale and many other local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the development of the Eastgate Theatre building.\nDiscussions are already underway about progressing to phase two which will improve and reconfigure the foyer/caf\u0026eacute areas.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sheriff-orders-gala-woman-to-hand-over-car-keys","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has been ordered to give up her car keys after being accused of two drink driving offences in the space of two months.\nJune McKain has been told she cannot drive a vehicle until the outcome of her trial in November.\nThe 58-year-old of Ladhope Crescent, appeared from custody at Selkirk Sherf Court where she pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving with a breath/alcohol count of 42 microgrammes -

Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message. Let people know what you\u0026rsquove seen and the emotions you\u0026rsquove felt.      \"Millions of children all over the world live in silence.\"    \u0027The Silent Child\u0027 screenwriter and star Rachel Shenton signed her #Oscars acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film. https:t.co/t3Dtf4Uy3c pic.twitter/PYB0M7gRNs"},{"url":null,"title":"hearing-to-take-place-on-substation-plans-at-former-cockenzie-power-station","story":"  Scottish Ministers called in the planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd  earlier this year before East Lothian Council had been given a chance to make a decision on the proposal.  ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer  members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again ening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"work-on-flats-at-former-musselburgh-tesco-set-to-start-in-spring","story":"  Plans were approved by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee nearly a year ago.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.

Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake.

Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.

The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.

Perth Sherf Court was told on Wednesday that the assault conviction was likely to lead to his dismissal from his job driving vulnerable people for the local authority.  Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated. He is already suspended and subject to an ongoing investigation.\"  Sherf Gillian Wade, who found McIntosh guilty of assault after a trial, fined him \u0026pound750.  She told him: \"It was a most unfortunate incident to have taken place and you are now suffering the consequences of having a conviction for assault on your record.  \"This will be very much felt by yourself. It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My we Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my we woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My we was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans ing from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light.

McIntosh, Stewart Crescent, Barrhead, was found guilty of assaulting Mr Wall on the A9 by punching him on the head to his injury on 16 April 2017.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"leading-academics-question-scotlands-flagship-free-education-policy","story":"  A series of leading voices raised concerns about the policy which sees Scottish students attend university without paying tuition fees as their counterparts do in the rest of the UK. There were also concerns raised about the overall level of funding for higher education.  One senior academic, who is part of the executive team of one of the nation\u0026rsquos leading universities, described the policy as a \u0026lsquoprop for the middle classes\u0026rsquo, and added that free university education was a \u0026lsquosacred cow\u0026rsquo in Scottish public le that could not be openly challenged.  :\u0026nbspNew industrial revolution means workers may never retire, warns Mark Carney  They also called for a \u0026lsquonational debate\u0026rsquo on the issue. They added that there was concern about the current system preventing the widening of access to higher education for those from low-income homes due to the limit put on the numbers of Scottish students at university.  The principal of another leading university, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: \u0026ldquoThe current funding model is unsustainable  we are going to get the level of investment we need to compete at the highest levels internationally and make sure we can take as many young Scots into higher education as possible in order to create a skilled population.\u0026rsquo  Free access to university puts an effective cap on the number of Scottish students that the sector can take in order to keep within Scottish government budgetary guidelines. In England and Wales, fees are around \u0026pound9,000 a year.  \"Funding is putting us in a dficult position,\" the university principal said. \"There\u0026rsquos been low investment from the Scottish government for over a decade now. It is time to look at a gradual increase in tuition fees for Scottish students - or at least consider it. A national conversation is needed.  \"It is dficult to have that conversation without it being politicised, and that dissuades constructive debate. We need to find a \u0026lsquosafe space\u0026rsquo where we can explore the pros and cons.  \"Is free education a good thing? Yes,  it is affordable, but no,  it is a challenge to sustain. A new model would mean more staff, more students and a better Scotland. Universities are places of innovation and we need innovation on this issue now.\"  Peter Mathieson, principal of Edinburgh University, said there was a \u0026lsquorisk of politicising education\u0026rsquo, adding: \"When it comes to the debate around tuition fees, my view is:  you want high quality education then it\u0026rsquos got to be paid for as it is expensive. Whether it is paid for by tuition fees, governments or loans, that is a debate we can have in society.  Mathieson said that the \u0026lsquorole of tuition fees versus other means of funding is very personal for me as I was the first member of my family to go to university\u0026rsquo. His father died young and his family did not have a lot of money, he said, adding that  there had been \u0026lsquotuition fees in my day then I think it less likely I would have gone to university\u0026rsquo.  Mathieson said he did not want the fear of debt to deter students from higher education. However, he said: \"The idea that we\u0026rsquove got to make sure higher education is attainable - for me that doesn\u0026rsquot immediately translate into an ideological argument over tuition fees.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a school leaver my ability to tolerate debt was very limited, the reality for a lot of school leavers now is that  they are going to go to university they need to be able to tolerate debt. I think that\u0026rsquos an issue we can\u0026rsquot hide from.  He added: \u0026rsquoI think university education without realistic estimates of what it costs is counter-productive. The idea that Scotland doesn\u0026rsquot want tuition fees I can live with, as long as there is a recognition that the money has to come from somewhere. What I don\u0026rsquot accept is that education is free, as it is not.\"  Mathieson said he wanted to see the contribution from the Scottish government increased. \"If we want more Scottish students at university and they aren\u0026rsquot going to pay tuition fees then that level of income needs to be increased.\"  He mooted more sponsorship from industry - including the armed forces. \"In own my field, medicine, the armed forces sponsor some students so you can have army-sponsored medical students who then commit to working with the armed forces after graduation.\"  Jim McDonald, principal of Strathclyde University, said that his institution delivered \u0026lsquosix times the investment from the government back into the Scottish economy\u0026rsquo, adding: \u0026ldquoI am sure the Scottish government understands the value of the higher education sector but  you look internationally there are many of our competitors both in Europe, America and Asia, which are really ramping up investment in higher education as they see it as a key component of growth.  \"This means in order to attract and retain the best academic talent and best students from home and abroad, we need to make sure that higher education is properly funded.  Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, principal of Glasgow University, said he supports the current policy by the Scottish government. Muscatelli said tuition fees are a \u0026lsquosocietal choice. \"What we see is that in developed countries, some chose to keep education free - like Scotland, Germany and Scandinavia. What you have to do is invest in the cost of higher education, and frankly we are happy with the investment that we are receiving from the public purse to educate home students. He said Scotland, Germany and Sweden all had \u0026ldquogreat universities. I think you have great publicly funded systems around the world that work very well.  Muscatelli, chair of the Russell Group of leading universities and a prominent economist internationally, added: \u0026ldquoOther countries, such as England, have gone another way, but let\u0026rsquos not kid ourselves, you see the debate in England - fees were introduced and now people are saying perhaps some of this should be publicly funded. Society will periodically go through this debate, but as long as universities are properly funded through the public purse I am perfectly happy with the situation.  John Swinney, the deputy First Minister and education secretary, said he \u0026ldquolooked at tuition fees through the lens of values. The values I associate with education is that society should benefit from collective investment in the educational development of our population - that is the moral purpose of education.  He added: \u0026ldquoWhat comes with that is a commitment to make sure that universities are properly and effectively funded, and that is the very firm commitment we have given to our institutions.  On comments that the effective cap on Scottish student numbers limited access to university for poorer students, Swinney said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot accept that point. What is important is that we make sure there are no barriers in the way of young people from a range of backgrounds gaining access to university education.  :\u0026nbspThe Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt - Muriel Gray on the Glasgow School of Art\u0027s plan to restore the the iconic building  He also reiterated the government\u0026rsquos commitment to the policy, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely committed to the policy of no tuition fees approach to university for Scottish students and that will remain the commitment of the SNP government.  Mary Senior, the University and College\u0026rsquos Union Scottish official, said Scotland should not go down the same route as England when it came to tuition fees, and added that the effective cap on Scottish students was a \u0026ldquopressure that needed to be addressed."},{"url":null,"title":"ferries-out-of-commission-as-repair-work-is-underway-on-fleet-including-new-45m-vessel","story":"  One is the brand new \u0026pound45million flagship vessel MV Glen Sannox that was launched last year and is due to serve the country\u0027s busiest ferry route.  The other is the 35 year old MV Isle of Arran and still serves that route despite being well past its normal operational age.  But neither are currently carrying passengers across the Firth of Clyde from Ardrossan to Brodick on the isle of Arran as they are currently undergoing vital repair work in Greenock, although the MV Isle of Arran is due to be back in operation today .  Meanwhile, the route is served by the MV Caledonian Isles which has also had engineering works carried last week, with engineers making repairs during passenger-only crossings to ensure that people could get to and from the island on a drastically reduced timetable.  It comes after Scotland\u0027s main ferry operator, Caledonian MacBrayne, has been heavily criticised after a summer of disruption across the network due to breakdowns, with the average age of vessel on a leline route now 22 years.  Ferry passengers are now facing yet more disruption on CalMac\u0027s ageing fleet after the two new prototype vessels, the MV Glen Sannox and its sister ship, which cost \u0026pound100 million have been delayed yet again.  The dual fuel flagships were supposed to be with the ferry operator this summer and autumn, but are now expected next summer and spring 2020.  But the MV Glen Sannox now sits on the Clyde without funnels as engineers work on its bulbous bow - nearly a year after being launched by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.  It comes amid concerns that a 10-fold increase in traffic is already causing severe problems for island communities.  Tourism bosses on the Outer Hebrides have already warned the disruption has cost them millions of pounds already this year.  Stornoway businessman Louis Maciver says he could not sustain his business without reliable ferries.  Mr Maciver, co-owner of Techmobile, a tech company in Stornoway, said 98 percent of his deliveries come by ferry.  He said: \"We are totally reliant on them. For us it means we can get the latest games at the same time as they are released online. It gives us a chance to compete.\"  \"To say ferries are vital to our business - and every other business here - is an understatement. We need reliable services.  \"The mistake they made was ordering one big ferry to carry both freight and vehicles and passengers . They should have gone for two, smaller and quicker ferries which could have also helped ease the disruption in the event of breakdowns etc.\"  Ironically the four-year-old MV Loch Seaforth \u0026ndash the biggest and newest large ferry in the CalMac fleet \u0026ndash was not supposed to breakdown because three back-up engines aim to keep the ship going on her regular timetable and speed even  one of her two main engines breaks down.  But that did not prevent a major emergency in the Minch last month when the \u0026pound42 million ship lost power when a severe fault hit the engines\u0026rsquo cooling systems.  Marion Macleod, a lecoach and music teacher who lives in Stornoway, warns that she may have to move to the mainland.  She said: \"If there was no reliable ferry service I would leave. This summer has been the worst I can remember for disruption. These islands would not exist without ferries - they are our roads. What we need are services we can trust.\"  So far this year five ships on Clyde and Hebridean services have been out of service.  Islay, Harris and Uist have all hit by disruption, when the Hebridean Isles built in 1985, one of two ferries that normally serve Islay, was withdrawn to work on the Tarbert and Lochmaddy routes.  Newer ships, such as the MV Clansman, which services the outer Hebrides from Oban, were among those out of action.  The knock-on effect of vessels being redeployed proved to be a severe test for the 32 ferries that serve 51 ports on 49 routes.  Between January and the end of July this year, 2,326 out of 79,203 CalMac scheduled sailings were cancelled.  Of these, 327 were for mechanical reasons. Most of the rest were because of bad weather.  Nigel Scott, spokesman for Western Isles Council, said the authority was meeting Scottish Government ministers soon to \"take matters forward.\"  He said: \"Obviously we have been expressing concern about the performance over the summer to the Scottish Government.\"  \"There has been undoubtedly disruption to thousands of passengers, businesses and the islands\u0027 economy. We rely on the ferries they are literally leline services for us.  \"We have argued for a two ferry solution on the Stornoway to Ullapool route - and right from the start. CalMac are not providing best value for money. There\u0027s a delay in new ferries which is disappointing and the new online booking system has not happened\".  \"Given the importance to communities and businesses in the islands these are serious issues which are impacting on the local economy and travelling public. It could be a factor in people moving away\".  Vice Convener of Highland Council Allan Henderson has also vented his frustration at the delay to the two new ferries being built on the Clyde.  Writing in this month\u0027s local West Word newspaper,he said: \"We have to give the Scottish Government credit for trying to get ship building going again in Scotland, but the decision to continue building super liners for island to mainland ferries, coupled with diesel/LNG technology instead of more nimble ferries that could shuttle back and fore and relieve at other ports has backfired.  \"Clearly the yard is not up to the task, with \u0026pound97 million now having been spent and a further \u0026pound30 million \u0027invested\u0027 to get two vessels fitted out, and that is long after they were due. Just think how many ships CalMac could have had at their disposal  conventionally powered 60 metre versions of the Coruisk  had been ordered with that money?  \"Another problem caused by this delay and extra financing is that the vessel replacement plan has also been set backwards with the contract having to be delivered on ever ageing vessels and absolutely no more vessels in the pipeline.  Last year, CalMac carried five million passengers, 1.5 million cars, 80,000 buses, and one million metres of commercial traffic.  Figures show the number of motorhomes travelling to the Western Isles has risen over the past decade, with nearly 2,000 heading to Harris alone.  The huge rise in tourists follows the introduction of a Scottish Government scheme to make island ferry fares more affordable.  The Road Equivalent Tarf bases fares on the cost of travelling the equivalent distance by road and was introduced to boost remote economies - and worked so well the number of cars on one route is up by more than 80 per cent.  But tourism operators in the Western Isles say they have lost \"millions\" from ferry disruption throughout the summer.  Outer Hebrides Tourism  said it saw \"no end to the critical issues caused by the continued unreliability of ferries to these islands as we end the season as it began - with disruption.\"  OHT previously costed ferry disruption to the islands\u0027 economy at \u0026pound6m.  Ian Fordham, Chair of OHT, said: \"Whilst the Scottish Government must now invest in CalMac to improve fleet resilience, they should also recompense our local businesses and invest in rebuilding confidence in the Outer Hebrides as a tourist destination after the negative economic impact of this summer\u0027s ferry fiasco! This has hit tourism business not just this summer but its future growth too.\"  OHT said ministers must address CalMac\u0026rsquos ageing fleet and its inability to move beyond the \"kne-edge on which it sits\" for service reliability.  Among its other complaints were that two new ferries were delayed \"with nothing else in a build pipeline.\"  Mr Fordham added:\"We continue to raise this signicant risk to the sustainability of our tourism businesses.The Outer Hebrides is a stunning place for tourists to visit and enjoy all year around but we want them to be able to get here and home again without disruption.  \"There has been a distinct lack of any visible action this summer from Transport Scotland and successive Scottish Government Ministers - as ministerial responsibility for ferries has changed three times in the past six months alone - to address this despite the local economic impact.\"  He said four new vessels - in addition to the ones under construction - or three plus a fixed link in the Sound of Harris, are required to provide a satisfactory service and room for the local tourism sector to sustain and flourish.  The First Minister has said she is \"determined\" to improve ferry services to Scotland\u0027s island communities in the wake of widespread concern over reliability.  Nicola Sturgeon said \"a range of work\" was ongoing to ensure that those living and working on islands \"have the services they deserve\".

However,  you were a mammal vocalisation researcher listening in \u0026ndash yes there are such people! \u0026ndash you would have been able to tell whether the winner was going to be Novak Djokovic or Juan Martin Del Potro and put your money on Novak to beat the bookies\u0026rsquo odds.  We know that grunting can distract an opponent \u0026ndash one Dutch player was once docked a point for counter-grunting \u0026ndash and can also help a player to hit signicantly harder, but predicting the outcome by grunt? Apparently so. Last year three such researchers at the University of Sussex published a paper in the journal Animal Behaviour entitled \u0026ldquoTennis Grunts Communicate Acoustic Cues to Sex and Contest Outcome. The conclusion was that, when winning, players\u0026rsquo grunts are lower pitched and losers pitch higher.  So  you\u0026rsquore a grunt aficionado you\u0026rsquod be able to confound the Ladbrokes algorithm and cash in. The lead researcher, one Jordan Raine, analysed 394 ying grunts from Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in the 2011 Wimbledon final and built his research from there. Nadal\u0026rsquos grunt apparently reveals \u0026ldquodeterministic chaos, akin to a motorbike erupting, while Djokovic\u0026rsquos ies a lot, but the one constant is something that sounds like a stled sneeze. Raine \u0026ndash where did he get the grant for this? That\u0027s what I want to know \u0026ndash also goes to drama schools to clock the sounds budding actors make when they\u0026rsquore told to imagine themselves in a war, or giving birth or falling from a tall building, or perhaps even being in a tennis final?  Raine, an Andy Murray fan, watched our boy in the second round of the US Open against Fernando Verdasco and knew from the first set it wasn\u0026rsquot going to end well because Verdasco\u0026rsquos pitch became lower while Murray just sounded like he was tired and wanted to go home to put his feet up. The denouement became inevitable when Verdasco served and loudly grunted what sounded like \u0026ldquoAu revoir. It was.  SCREAMS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE  Still in the strange but true and absolutely irrelevant category, going up to 11 on the Richter scale of sound effects, is the Wilhelm Scream, the most famous and most-used one in movie history, ululating in more than 370 films to date, from Toy Story to Star Wars \u0026ndash where Luke Skywalker shoots a Stormtrooper on the Death Star who falls off the edge \u0026ndash to Lord of the Rings and Reservoir Dogs.  The effect was called Wilhelm after the on-screen name of an actor who gives it out as he is hit by an arrow in the 1953 Western Charge at Feather River. But it was actually created two years earlier in a Raoul Walsh oater, Distant Drums, starring Gary Cooper, where a soldier is dragged underwater by an alligator and as he goes lets out the bellow. It was dubbed-on in post production by the musician and actor Sheb Wooley who was working on the film as a voice extra.  Wooley has never received proper credit for the scream, nor, I doubt, residuals for re-use. And he certainly shouldn\u0026rsquot get any credit for bringing out possibly the worst-ever song in popular music, The Purple People Eater. It was covered by our own teen pop star in a kilt, Leith\u0027s own Jackie Dennis, in 1958. And by Judy Garland.  In the trivia of unwanted facts useful only in a pensioners\u0026rsquo pub quiz it also went to Number One in Finland, recorded by British comedian Barry Cryer.  COLD COMFORT  The family-owned clothing company Johnstons of Elgin reports a record year in turnover and profits, and work at its mills in Hawick and Elgin is booming.  A growing liking for cashmere knitwear by customers in warm climates, like Panama and Dubai, is largely responsible, which seems like a bit of a contradiction in terms, not to say climates. But apparently it\u0026rsquos because shoppers frequent air-conditioned malls and  it gets a bit parky they pop into a shop and purchase a fleecy warm jumper.  International sales are up a whopping 30 per cent. The \u0026ldquooutstanding results were reported by the company\u0026rsquos managing director. And could there be a more apt name for him than Simon Cotton?  MAGGIE MAY? SHE CERTAINLY DID  The sex \u0026rsquon\u0026rsquo drugs lestyle schlockumentary about Princess Margaret during the week reminded me of the nickname of one of her many boyfriends. He was known as \u0026ldquoBungalow Bill because, while there was nothing up top, he was exceedingly well furnished below.  It\u0026rsquos not just royalty \u0026ndash sport, too, throws up many wonderful monnikers. There was the Reading football player Fitz Hall who was known as \u0026ldquoOne Size, for obvious reasons. Aston Villa midfielder Gilles de Bilde was \u0026ldquoBob.  The 1990s Spurs midfielder Justin Edinburgh was known as \u0026ldquoMusselburgh because it was just in Edinburgh.  The rugby player Martin Offiah was \u0026ldquoChariots. Of course. The Gloucestershire cricketer Paul Romaines was \u0026ldquoHuman. And when Ewan McGregor\u0027s brother was in the RAF his call sign was \u0026ldquoObitwo.  Then there was the diddy police officer called \u0026ldquoLaptop, because he was a small PC. I\u0026rsquoll stop there before I get to Gordon \u0026ldquoJukebox Durie.  NEW ROLE FOR THE HAND OF GOD  On Wednesday last week, the French sports diary L\u0026rsquoEquipe published a rather cruel cartoon about Diego Maradona as the news came out that he\u0026rsquos been appointed manager of a Mexican side.  I\u0026rsquove been rather fond of him since witnessing his first international goal for Argentina against Scotland, of course, at Hampden Park in 1979.  It\u0026rsquos been all downhill since he stopped playing, with ballooning weight. He\u0027s also a recovering drug addict.  He also collapsed rather dramatically in a box \u0026ndash not the penalty one \u0026ndash watching Argentina against Nigeria in the World Cup in June. Now, rather strangely, he\u0026rsquos been made boss of Dorados, third bottom of the Mexican second ision. The club is based in Culiac\u0026aacuten, which is the home of the Sinaloa drug cartel. Perhaps he just wanted to cut out the middle men?  MILLAR\u0026rsquoS CROSSING  The professional cycling union, the CPA , is about as democratic as Stalin\u0026rsquos USSR, with Chris Froome calling it a dictatorship, joined by the present Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas firing his own broadside at the establishment.  The presidency is up for the vote in nine days with the incumbent, Gianni Bugno, going for re-election. Under the rules riders can only vote  they turn up to the meeting, which is in Innsbruck, and given the pro racing season is still going strong it\u0026rsquos not very likely that many will.  The sport has often been in the news for all the wrong reasons, or the pre-eminent one, drugs. In one of those gambits you might describe as setting a gamekeeper to catch a thief  step forward the challenger to Bugno, Scotland\u0026rsquos own David Millar.  Millar, when he was a notable competitor, was banned for two years for, er, doping."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-cool-list-continued-from-60-to-21","story":"  The same rules apply.

Her photographs make us love ours bodies  She has photographed everything from Edinburgh strippers to Orange marches, but her latest, most personal work has been a series of women, shot naked at twilight on the new moon \u0026ndash and they have created a whole body positivity moment. At talks connected to her exhibitions, women are opening up about their bodies and how they feel about them. The Edinburgh-based Swedish photographer is also battling hard against censorship of the female body on social media. Her next project, she speculates, is likely to be on fathers and sons, again naked on the new moon. \u0026ldquoI think, she says, \u0026ldquopeople are just people and people just need to be seen and feel some love sometimes.  59 Keith McIvor  DJ, 50  Why? He\u0026rsquos a DJ legend  As JD Twitch, one half of DJ duo Optimo, Keith McIvor set up the legendary 1990s club night, Pure, and was founder of Optimo Espacio whose weekly residency ran in Glasgow\u0026rsquos the Sub club till 2000. The weekly gigs came to an end, but Optimo kept DJing and touring and became a global phenomenon. In recent years, they\u0026rsquove brought their eclectic and experimental coolness right back to Glasgow, opening the Bananamoon bar on Great Western Road and playing big parties like their 20th birthday bash. He and his Optimo partner, Jonnie Wilkes, are frequently on tour and regularly releasing new music. \u0026ldquoUp next, he says, \u0026ldquois an archive release from Port Glasgow\u0026rsquos finest Robert Rental. In November, McIvor releases a compliation of German post-punk music called Kreaturen Der Nacht. He also once lobbed an egg at Margaret Thatcher. \u0026ldquoIt missed, he says.  58 Tammy Koslowski  Nail entrepreneur, 29  Why? Nail art is huge \u0026ndash and she\u0026rsquos the Glasgow guru  Stay sassy. That\u0026rsquos the slogan on the neon lights and merchandise of Glasgow\u0026rsquos NAF! and  one person knows how to do that it\u0026rsquos the salon\u0026rsquos boss Tammy Koslowski. Not only is she the business-mind behind the salon, which won Nail Salon Of The Year last year, but she has painted nails for major fashion campaigns \u0026ndash most notably Stella McCartney\u0026rsquos Winter 2017. Her salon is reputedly up for trying whatever wild and wacky nail art designs you fancy \u0026ndash and even boasts an in-house pooch, Betty. \u0026ldquoShe\u0026rsquos been my sidekick for eight years, says Koslowski. It was when she was bored, eight years ago, while working on her dissertation for her clothing design and technology course, that she first started painting her nails. \u0026ldquoI got a little nail art pen and started doodling leopard print on my nails and it just totally snowballed from there.  57 Christopher Millington  Model, 28  Why? He is the beard  Back in 2015 a tweet by iconic bearded-model Christopher Millington saying that the beard was \u0026ldquoover caused a wave of panicked news articles. It was as  the oracle had spoken. RIP beard. Of course, it turned out that this was a slight exaggeration. The beard was not over, but massively pared down from the great, flowing fleece it once was to something a little sharper. Indeed, you can still see it now on Instagram posts by the model, who no lives in New York. Sometimes called the Bearded Scotsman, Millington was scouted in the streets of London by Urban Outfitters and has been a feature of fashion campaigns ever since. He now has 485,000 followers on Instagram. We still await the date when Millington goes for the full clean shave. Then we\u0026rsquoll definitely know the beard is dead.  56 Logan Hannah  Motor sports champion, 17  Why? She\u0026rsquos the girl racer who is going to beat the boys  At 16 years old, East Kilbridge teenager Logan Hannah made history by becoming the first woman to compete at the F4UAE races \u0026ndash and she made it clear this was just the start of things. Her ambition is to make it to F1 or American IndyCar and be a role model for girls. \u0026ldquoI hope, she said in a BBC interview earlier this year, \u0026ldquoto get to a certain level that I\u0026rsquom not only viewed as a female driver but as a driver itself\u0026hellip We are just as good as the boys,  not better. Her interest in driving was sparked when, as a youngster, she hung out with her motor-racing father, Graeme Hannah, in his pit garage. \u0026ldquoAs much as she has enjoyed coming to the events, her dad has said, \u0026ldquoshe always said, \u0026lsquoDad, I\u0026rsquod rather be driving.\u0026rsquo  55 Christopher Kane  Fashion designer, 36  Why? He gave us back the joy of sex \u0026ndash on a catwalk  Kane is the biggest Scottish name in fashion and style, worn by the Duchess of Cambridge, Michelle Obama and Cate Blanchett. He\u0026rsquos also daring, and last year, while most creatives, in the wake of #MeToo, were being cautious around anything too sexy, he brought out a collection inspired by the 1970s Joy Of Sex manuals and fizzing with eroticism and suburban kinkiness. \u0026ldquoI have never shied away from sex in the collections and this one is no dferent, said Kane. \u0026ldquoSince the beginning, I have found it fundamental to our idea of women. Women with their own power who create their own worlds. This week sees his new collection hit the catwalk at London Fashion Week. Bring on the joy.  54 Dougie Wallace  Photographer  Why? He shows us the super-rich in their grotesque glory  53 Sorcha Groundsell  Actor, 20  Why? She\u0026rsquos a shapeshter who loves to croft  This summer, it was hard to escape the hype around the new Netflix teen supernatural drama, the Innocents \u0026ndash a show which The Atlantic described as \u0026ldquothe most Netflixy dramatic series ever made.There, in every trailer, advert or article, was the face of its 20-year-old Scottish star, Sorcha Groundsell. Hitherto little-known, the Gaelic-speaking, Lewis-raised actress is now huge, and signed up for six seasons as shapeshter June McDaniel. But what makes her coolest of all is that, in the run up to the series launch, she wasn\u0026rsquot working the international party scene \u0026ndash rather she was hanging out for three weeks on her parents\u0026rsquo Hebridean croft, making hay. \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos really nice to be able to do something that is so removed from acting, she said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos good to be somewhere I can just mooch about in my wellies.\"  52 Andrew Fleming-Brown  Arts venue founder, 40  Why? He shows us what you can do with a big warehouse  Andrew Fleming-Brown is also known as Mutley, the brains behind one of Scotland\u0026rsquos leading arts and music venues, SWG3. The father-of-two, married to model Lauren Tempany, started his career as a promoter and curator, but when, in 2005, a derelict site in a former Tobacco Bond warehouse became available, he jumped at the chance of taking it on. Thus SWG3 was born. But what exactly is it? It\u0026rsquos a clubbing destination, a caf\u0026eacute, a massive outdoor space called the Yard, a TV studio facility and much, much more. SWG3 regularly host the hippest art events, pop-ups and live gigs. \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore unique, said Fleming-Brown last year. \u0026ldquoThat whole warehouse culture has been booming in London for ten years but we don\u0026rsquot really have anything else like that in Glasgow.  51 Pam Hogg  Designer  Why? All the cool cats have worn her cat suits  Name a female pop or rock icon \u0026ndash Rihanna, Kylie Minogue, Debbie Harry, Lady Gaga \u0026ndash and they\u0026rsquove probably worn Pam Hogg\u0026rsquos clothes. \u0026ldquoEvery woman who\u0026rsquos ever tried on one of my catsuits has said, \u0026lsquoOh my God, I can\u0026rsquot wear that!\u0026rsquo she has said. \u0026ldquoI always tell them to just try it on. When they do, they instantly feel empowered. For Hogg is all about that female power. Her 2014 collection, Courage, was a tribute to the Russian activist collective Pussy Riot.  The post-punk designer started designing back in the early 1980s. Not content with just being a designer, however, Hogg has also done her time on stage as a singer and musician, and even supported Debbie Harry on the Blondie comeback tour. Her latest project has been to design the costumes for the Citizen\u0026rsquos Theatre\u0026rsquos production of Cyrano De Bergerac \u0026ndash and, of course, they rock.  50 Malath Abbas  Games designer, 37  Why? It\u0026rsquos games. Enough said!  Games culture in Scotland is changing. It\u0026rsquos not all about the big studios making Grand Theft Auto and Minecraft. There\u0026rsquos also an alternative scene of people hanging out, playing together and making more personal and experimental games. People like Malath Abbas, founder of the Dundee-based Biome collective in Dundee. Originally from Iraq, Abbas grew up in Liverpool and came to Dundee because of its thriving games industry. He believes games can be about so much more than what you can do with a screen.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom interested, he says, \u0026ldquoin the idea of taking games away from the screen and seeing the city a landscape as being playful. Biome collaborated on the spectacular sound and light installation at the V\u0026ampA opening party last week. Currently, they are working on a virtual reality game called Garden, in which the player plants neon plants that make music. \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore trying to create a VR experience that\u0026rsquos mindful, relaxing and is actually appealing to a broad spectrum of people, says Abbas.  49 Louise Rusk  Restaurateur, 37  Why? She\u0026rsquos queen of the Tomahawk steak  We all know veganism is cooler than cool. But, actually, so is meat \u0026ndash particularly when it\u0026rsquos grass-fed, hung-on the bone beef, dry-aged for 35 days. And nowhere does that quite like The Butchershop Bar And Grill, set up by Louise and her husband James Rusk, son of hair gurus Irvine and Rita. The former fitness professional, who toured the world as an Irish dancer at just 18 years old, is behind some of Glasgow\u0026rsquos coolest eateries, whether they be The Spanish Butcher or Hutcheson\u0026rsquos Grill, and they are as much about the style and design as the locally sourced food. Her own favourite meal? \u0026ldquoHas to be a Sunday Roast. Grew up with our family coming together every Sunday and we continue the tradition to this day.  48 Scott Reid  Actor, 25  Why? He is one of the best actors of his generation.  Scott Reid burst onto our television screens in BBC Scotland comedy series Still Game playing Methadone Mick, a recovering drug addict with a heart of gold and set of gnashers to rival the toothy grin of former footballer Frank McAvennie . The character, who debuted in 2016, became an instant favourite among viewers. When did Reid, 25, first get an inkling his star was on the rise? Well, there was seeing his face tattooed on a stranger\u0026rsquos leg. And people sharing pictures of themselves dressed up as him at Hallowe\u0026rsquoen. Oh, and a Glasgow bar named a cocktail in his honour. Further testament came when fans snapped up 10,000 sets of replica rubber teeth during the Still Game Live 2 shows at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow last year.  Reid, who hails from Paisley, has since gone on to roles in BBC police drama Line of Duty. He will  to our screens in the final series of Still Game this autumn and recently shot Amazon Prime sci-fi fantasy Carnival Row, which is due out in early 2019.  47 Val McDermid  Author, 63  Why? She remains the undisputed queen of crime  Sell as many books as Val McDermid has \u0026ndash 40 million or so \u0026ndash and you ought to be more establishment than cool. But somehow the Queen of Crime has never quite lost her alternative vibe, and with another novel featuring cold case detective Karen Pirie out last month she\u0026rsquos still firing on all literary cylinders. Meanwhile her plots continue to be highly relevant. Last year\u0026rsquos Insidious Intent, for instance threw a light on coercive control in a year in which the new Scottish domestic abuse law was being passed. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot do it with any sense of banging the drum, she explained in a recent interview. \u0026ldquoBut I do it because things come along that interest me and I think will interest my readers.  46 Talat Yaqoob  Feminist, 32  Why? She\u0026rsquos the powerhouse bringing equality to the workplace  If you want to know just how cool Talat Yaqoob is the best place to start is the forceful, funny and strident TEDx talk she did on \u0026ldquoreclaiming feminism back in 2014. \u0026ldquoImagine, she said, \u0026ldquo we and every one of us challenged sexism \u0026ndash it would cease to exist. Yaqoob has been fighting that battle ever since, and doing so in ways that are changing the climate in Scotland. She was a founder of Women 50:50, an organisation campaigning for equal representation and is now director of Equate Scotland, an organisation promoting women in STEM.  But Yaqoob didn\u0026rsquot come from a particularly political family. \u0026ldquoInequality isn\u0026rsquot something that we would have talked about in any academic way, it\u0026rsquos just something we lived \u0026ndash constantly. Her parents were immigrants from Pakistan who came to Scotland in the 1950s. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom first generation here she says, \u0026ldquoand being a woman, being a woman of colour, being a Muslim woman - all of those things, all of those experiences, come with the experience of inequality. Once you\u0026rsquove had your eyes opened to that, it\u0026rsquos not something that you can ignore.  45 Oli Norman  Entrepreneur, 42  Why? His Merchant City HQ has a Prosecco bar  One of the hippest things about Oli Norman is not that his itison, luxury deals website has been phenomenally successful, or that he\u0026rsquos married to presenter Cat Cubie \u0026ndash these things are quite cool \u0026not but that his company, last year was named one of the 100 best UK companies to work for. In other words, he\u0026rsquos the man behind Scotland\u0026rsquos coolest office, complete with complementary Prosecco bar, fairy-lit oak tree and yoga studio. \u0026ldquoThe itison office, he says, \u0026ldquois an experiment in breaking down the barriers between work and le.  But Norman also deserves a place on this list because of his support for the homeless. Itison\u0026rsquos fundraising feeds Social Bite\u0026rsquos entire programme over the whole year. We also like his work philosophy. \u0026ldquoI only choose, he says, \u0026ldquoto do things that I\u0026rsquoll find fun  things aren\u0026rsquot fun, we stop doing them. Simple.  44 Moyo Akand\u0026eacute  Actor  Why? She\u0026rsquos making films that tell black stories  When Moyo Akand\u0026eacute, and her sister Morayo, brought out their first film collaboration, 1745 it became one of the most-talked about short films in Scotland in years.  Inspired by real adverts published in 18th century newspapers for runaway slaves, it told the story of two sisters on the run from their Highland master.  But Moyo Akand\u0026eacute is about more than 1745. The daughter of Nigerian immigrants is making an impact in her industry on many levels. Earlier this year, she starred as a kick-ass thief in the disaster-movie, The Hurricane Heist, and this autumn she\u0026rsquos set to appear in The Cry, a television baby-abduction drama starring Jenna Coleman.  What we\u0026rsquore most looking forward to, though, is the Akand\u0026eacute sister\u0026rsquos planned feature version of 1745. \u0026ldquoWe saw, she said to us earlier this year, \u0026ldquothat there weren\u0026rsquot many challenging roles for women of colour in this industry. We put our heads together and thought  there aren\u0026rsquot those roles out there, we might as well create them for ourselves.  43 Kayus Bankole  Musician,30  Why? He\u0026rsquos hip, hot and now  It wasn\u0026rsquot surprising when Young Fathers won the award for Scottish Album Of The Year . Anyone who had heard Cocoa Sugar, by the hip-hop trio, probably saw it coming.  Besides, everything they do makes its mark. Back in 2014 they won the Mercury prize with their album Dead. Six of their songs were in last year\u0026rsquos T2: Trainspotting and defined the movie\u0026rsquos sound. This is also the second time they\u0026rsquove won SAY.  So, they\u0026rsquore indisputably cool \u0026ndash and really it\u0026rsquos hard to say which of the three of them is coolest. Here, we\u0026rsquove picked Kayus Bankole, but it could have been any member of this band that delivers a sound that is like no other. As James Milton wrote in the NME, \u0026ldquo\u0026lsquoCocoa Sugar\u0026rsquo isn\u0026rsquot a filtered version of what came before. Instead, it cements their status as riled-up oddballs determined to reinvent the wheel.  42 Vic Henderson  Chef, 41  Why? The chef\u0026nbspgave vegans the restaurants they deserve  Veganism is cool. But that\u0026rsquos not the only reason why Vic Henderson, the resident chef at The 78 Bar \u0026amp Kitchen, is cool. Henderson, who identies as non-binary, and goes under the pronoun \u0026ldquothey, had always cooked for the whole of their\u0026nbspfamily from an early age.  \u0026ldquoWhen I moved out, says the chef, \u0026ldquoI started cooking a lot when I was away with my bands or when touring bands stayed at my house. It would always be vegan and would always be like a big pot of something delicious.  Right now, Henderson\u0026rsquos plan is to open a fine-dining restaurant in Glasgow. \u0026ldquoI still think there\u0026rsquos a gap in the market for places to go that are next level for vegans and non-vegans alike. It would bring Glasgow up to the same standard as vegan destinations like London, Los Angeles and New York.  Henderson, who also worked up\u0026nbspMono in Glasgow and the Harmonium in Leith, sports some impressive tattoos, one of which is an armoured skeleton. \u0026ldquoI just got that from my friend Paul Clav\u0026eacute. He\u0026rsquos one of my favourite tattooists as he has the best chat when you get tattoos. You end up taking about veganism, toxic masculinity, gender issues, cool nieces or daughters, fat politics, period poverty, music, food and loads of other important stuff. Plus his drawings are badass!  41 Ervin Trykowski  Global whisky ambassador, 31  Why? He gives whisky that  Millennial vibe  Manila, Singapore, Sydney, Melbourne, Bali \u0026hellip the global whisky ambassador for Singleton whisky  seems like he\u0026rsquos been everywhere in the last year, and not just to pour a few drams either.  In Manila he was in a bar juggling spinning vinyl and providing a range of Scottish whisky cocktails. Trykowski who hails from Aberdeen and has a Polish grandfather, is giving whisky a vibe that is young and hip. As Esquire put it, \u0026ldquohe\u0026rsquos the Millennial man fronting the 180-year-old whisky maker.  The former bartender and mixologist, however, is always glad to get back home from his travels to his two French bulldogs, Bont\u0026egrave and Clyde. He also has a quirky obsession with badgers. \u0026ldquoOh, yeah, he says. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove got a big badger tattoo on the back of my arm. Don\u0026rsquot ask why, I can\u0026rsquot remember. I\u0026rsquom a big fan of the Mustelid family. The badgers, pine martens, stoats, weasels. I think they\u0026rsquore cool guys.  40 Clara McGregor  Model and photographer, 22  Why? She\u0026rsquos a rebel who out-cools her famous dad  22 years on from Trainspotting Ewan McGregor is now so huge it\u0026rsquos hard to see him as cool. But his daughter, Clara, now that\u0026rsquos a dferent matter.  The photographer and model is proving to be such a rebel she warrants a place on this list. Last autumn, she caught media attention when, following the break-up of her parents she tweeted that her dad\u0026rsquos new girlfriend was \u0026ldquotrash. In spring, her photos featured in Playboy, along with the headline, \u0026ldquoClara McGregor Isn\u0026rsquot Just Ewan\u0026rsquos Daughter. She\u0026rsquos Your New Crush.  What\u0026rsquos her grand plan? To be an actor, of course. \u0026ldquoHonestly, as she said to Playboy, \u0026ldquoI would love to play someone like Patti Smith\u0026hellip There are so many badass women who would be so cool to play. Lee Miller, who was one of the first female war photographers, is another.  39 Tom Walkinshaw  Space entrepreneur, 28  Why? He\u0026rsquos the man behind the world\u0026rsquos smallest, lightest satellites  Seven years ago Tom Walkinshaw was graduating in business studies at Glasgow Caledonia University, and thinking he might like to get a job in the space industry. Only there wasn\u0026rsquot that much of an industry in Scotland back then, so he decided to help start it. He created Alba Orbital and dedicated himself to developing the cheapest, lightest satellite.  These tiny devices are called picosats, just around a kilogram in weight, and are revolutionary. \u0026ldquoAlba really started to make it viable option for people, says Walkinshaw. \u0026ldquoThe industry doesn\u0026rsquot believe in picosats. This is an attitude that we\u0026rsquore overturning in a global way.  38 Eubha Akilade  Actor, 20  Why? She\u0026rsquos a time-travelling hit with teenagers across the globe  Unless you\u0026rsquore a tween, you probably haven\u0026rsquot heard yet of Find Me In Paris, but, filling you in here, it\u0026rsquos massive. It\u0026rsquos the latest big Nickleodeon tween show, a time-travel drama about an international dance school, and it features a cast from all over the world, one of whom is 20-year-old Eubha Akilade from Glasgow.  On only her third acting job after she was spotted in an open call audition for CBBC show Eve, she is hitting the big time. Akilade recalls that following her audition, she found out within weeks that she would be off to Paris, and living for six months in an aparthotel with a cast of actors. Sounds like a party waiting to happen? \u0026ldquoActually, no, she says. \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos surprisingly little of that. We don\u0026rsquot have time and have to keep ourselves in top form.  37 Gareth Williams  Entrepreneur, 49  Why? He had an idea in a pub \u0026ndash which made billions  Ask any tech-oriented entrepreneur who their hero is and many will say Elon Musk. Ask that same question to an entrepreneur in Scotland and chances are, they\u0026rsquoll say Gareth Williams, co-founder of Skyscanner.  He\u0026rsquos the man who made a digital boom in Scotland seem possible \u0026ndash and it all started with a drink in a pub between friends, and an idea generated because Williams was struggling to find cheap flights to the Swiss Alps.  Two years ago Skyscanner was sold to a Chinese company for \u0026pound1.4 billion in 2016. But the the early days of Skyscanner weren\u0026rsquot nearly so easy. \u0026ldquoIt was two years, Williams has said, \u0026ldquobefore we got our first revenue \u0026ndash we earned \u0026pound46 in one month. Yes, I miss those days but it\u0026rsquos easy to forget the struggle of the startup days. There\u0026rsquos a lot I don\u0026rsquot miss.  36 Dr Liberty Vittert  Statistician, 29  Why? She uses maths to predict the future  Statistics, boring? Not when they\u0026rsquore in in the hands of Dr Liberty Vittert, though even she says that at dinner parties she\u0026rsquos prone to saying that she\u0026rsquos a \u0026ldquodata scientist studying fake news rather than statistician. Anyone who has watched her TEDx talk, How To Win The Lottery And Get Away With Murder will know, however, that there are many good reasons to love stats.  Vittert grew up in the US, and currently has a post at the University of Glasgow. Among her projects is one working with the cleft lip and palate charity Smile Train to map the human face to help children with facial deformities. She is also working on a \u0026ldquofun TV show called Lies And Alcohol.  Remarkably, it turns out that, at school, Vittert wasn\u0026rsquot good at mathematics. When she was 14 years old a maths teacher called her parents into school to say that, as she puts it, \u0026ldquoI was too dumb to be there and was just simply not smart enough to understand basic math. \u0026ldquoI have the most wonderful mother in the world who decided to get me a tutor and spent hours helping me. I just needed to learn maths in a dferent way. Sometimes, I wonder who the dumb one was in that whole scenario.  35 Kyle Ross  Barber, 28  Why? Because those beards are winning  When last year, Kyle Ross, MD of The Huntsman barbers in Aberdeen, went to Nurnberg for the final of the International Barber\u0026rsquos competition, he won the trophy for best UK barber.  As ambassador for Hanz de Fuko, he\u0026rsquos also traveling the world and attending fashion weeks in London and Paris. But, actually, he doesn\u0026rsquot class himself as a barber. He\u0026rsquos more, he says, of a hairstylist. So, those Aberdonians heading to The Huntsman get the kind of attention that comes with that. He teaches them to maintain their style, or gives them one that suits their lestyle rather than what\u0026rsquos on trend.  34 Donald MacLeod  Club owner and charity chair  Why? The maverick music man is all about the charity these days  One thing you can be sure of is that given the bands that have played at his venues \u0026ndash Oasis, Queens Of The Stone Age, Pearl Jam \u0026ndash music promoter and club supremo Donald MacLeod must have some cracking tales.  Not long after he started The Cathouse, in 1990, he has said, he gave up being in a band and became a music promoter because he realised what the people wanted was short-haired indie kids, not long-haired rockers like him. He still has that hair and stylish dress sense \u0026ndash and the persistence almost makes it cool. but these days, as chair of Nordoff Robbins, the music therapy charity, he\u0026rsquos more about the power of music. He once said, \u0026ldquoI encourage all bands to put a bit back so why not to Nordoff Robbins, who use music to do good?  33 Judy Murray  Tennis coach, 59  Why? She showed us she was more than just Andy\u0026rsquos mum  Murray is not just cool because she\u0026rsquos mother to two outstanding tennis stars. She\u0026rsquos cool because somewhere in her fties, after years of having been nagged at by the media, she seemed to blossom.  It started with that fabulous appearance on Strictly Come Dancing and then it just snowballed, till last year, there she was getting a spider tattoo and publishing her autobiography, Keeping The Score. That spider tattoo says it all. The arthropod was a reference to the one Robert the Bruce saw struggling in a cave and her belief in \u0026ldquoperseverance and the rewards that come with endless effort.  Somehow she got through it all \u0026ndash and is no longer just Andy and Jamie\u0026rsquos mum, but a national treasure in her own right.  32 Mark Mackie  Director of Regular Music  Why? We\u0026rsquore loving those Summer Nights at the Bandstand in Kelvingrove Park  The bands may be cool but it\u0026rsquos Mark Mackie of Regular Music who brings them to us. Whether at Edinburgh Castle, Kelvingrove or Loch Lomond, he\u0026rsquos been delivering to us some of the industry\u0026rsquos biggest names.  In fact, he\u0026rsquos been doing that since way back when he was a student at Glasgow University, where, strangely enough, he studied marine science and zoology. For Mackie wanted to follow in the footsteps of his idol Jacques Cousteau, until he became entertainments convenor of the Queen Margaret Union and got into bringing the best of bands into town. Marine science\u0026rsquos loss, Scottish culture\u0026rsquos gain.  31 Lynne Ramsay  Film-maker, 28  Why? She\u0026rsquos a tough genius working in a hard industry  You\u0026rsquove got to hand it to Lynne Ramsay. Last year, at the Cannes Film Festival, she got a standing ovation, as well as prizes for best screenplay and best actor, for a film that wasn\u0026rsquot even finished.  The film, You Were Never Really Here, starring Joaquin Phoenix, arrived on the screen straight out of the sound-mix and the audience loved it. It was a comeback to quell all the doubters who thought that when she walked out of directing Jane Got A Gun, her career was over.  But, the really cool thing about Ramsay is she sticks to her guns, and true to her working-class Glasgow background is always direct.  \u0026ldquoYou know, she said in an interview this year, \u0026ldquoI grew up in a place where people appreciate it when you\u0026rsquore very direct. I think that helps cut through a lot of bullshit with filming. Straight talking and going on your instincts was important when I grew up.  30 Kapka Kassabova  Author, 45  Why? She took us to the edge of Europe  Kapka Kassabova\u0026rsquos Border: A Journey To The Edge Of Europe was a book that was hard to pigeon-hole. Was it a memoir? A travelogue? A meditation on history and a lost part of Europe?  One thing that the literary world could agree on last year was that the book \u0026ndash which won the Saltire and other awards \u0026ndash was a marvel. Kassabova lives in a cottage in rural Inverness-shire, but she grew up in Communist Bulgaria, and Border tells the story of her  visit to the border between Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece and the people she met there. She describes her books as \u0026ldquogenre-bending hybrids of narrative non-fiction. Currently, she is writing another book and travelling to Macedonia and Albania to visit the world\u0026rsquos oldest lakes. It will, she says, be a \u0026ldquojourney into an ancestral landscape through my mother\u0026rsquos family.  29 Danny MacAskill  Mountain biker, 32  Why? We never get bored of his bike tricks  \u0026ldquoI finally made it to Graub\u0026uumlnden, says Danny MacAskill in his most recent film as he poses on his bike on the top of the Swiss mountain, before catapulting off on one of his high-adrenalin rides. In the film, sponsored by Red Bull, it\u0026rsquos still the same old Danny, only the mountains are higher, the budgets are bigger, and, well, it\u0026rsquos hard for him ever to top the feeling that he gave us when he did his first street trials video back in 2009, or the romance he delivered when he cycled The Ridge.  But nevertheless, the boy from Dunvegan, Isle of Skye, still knows how to move us \u0026ndash and he\u0026rsquos always bringing us something new. He did so earlier this, in spite of a recent broken knee cap, when he performed in the Celtic Connections music and bike spectacular Bothy Culture And Beyond.  \u0026ldquoI suppose when you first jump on your bike it\u0026rsquos your first dose of freedom, he said in a recent film about his Kilimanjaro bike trip. \u0026ldquoYou can constantly think of something new to challenge yourself and it\u0026rsquos kind of like a game that you\u0026rsquoll never get bored of.  28 Anna Meredith  Composer, 40  Why? She took the Edinburgh International Festival by storm  Bright, breezy and pleasantly down to earth isn\u0026rsquot how you\u0026rsquod imagine a composer of left field music to be \u0026ndash this, after all, is the woman who wrote a concerto for beatboxer and orchestra, and another piece to be performed using \u0026ldquobody percussion by a flash mob at the M6 services.  But the description fits Anna Meredith perfectly. A 10-year veteran of commissions for the BBC Proms and a winner of the Scottish Album Of The Year for Varmints, her debut record, the Scot\u0026rsquos playful but intellectually rigorous compositions had already won her a legion of admirers before this year\u0026rsquos Edinburgh Festival.  After it, she was the name on everyone\u0026rsquos lips thanks to having had not one but three separate works performed in the capital, including an orchestrated  performance of Varmints as part of the uber-cool Light On The Shore series at the Leith Theatre.  27 Robbie Grfith  Freerunner, 17  Why? He delivers his parkour thrills Renton-style  \u0026ldquoChoose le. Choose a sport. Choose an interest. These were the words which kicked off a viral video, a parkour remake of the classic Trainspotting scene, in which Coatbridge-lad, Grfith flipped and hurtled across Edinburgh, until it concluded with the alternative line, \u0026ldquoChoose parkour.  The film, Grfith recalls, was triggered when his brother suggested that he should make a video to the Trainspotting track and his dad then suggested they should go one further and remake the scene. Grfith and a film-maker friend made it, uploaded it in March last year, and overnight became a sensation. Since then Grfith has travelled the world with parkour, competing, visiting friends, doing a six month tour of America with his sponsor, the Motus Projects, and yes making more videos.  26 Mhairi Black  SNP MP, 24  Why? She won\u0026rsquot be told, on anything  One of the coolest things about Mhairi Black is the way that three years at Westminster doesn\u0026rsquot seem to have changed her very much at all. Yes, she\u0026rsquos got a little older \u0026ndash she went in at just 20 years old \u0026ndash but she hasn\u0026rsquot got any quieter or less determined. When, as she has said, Alex Salmond suggested to her that she should have a bit of a makeover and some new clothes, she ignored the advice. When online haters took her to pieces she shrugged them off, and then fought back \u0026ndash with a powerful speech earlier this year describing some of the misogynistic and homophobic comments she received.  Mhairi Black is who she is \u0026ndash gay, smart, passionate, angry, socialist \u0026ndash and she\u0026rsquos not changing any of that for anyone. She even still maintains her disregard for the institution which she is part of and, just last month, reiterated her feelings. \u0026ldquoIt does not serve us, she said, \u0026ldquoand in actual fact I would go so far as to say it\u0026rsquos not even a parliament it\u0026rsquos a club that masquerades itself.  25 Katie Archibald  Cyclist, 24  Why? She\u0026rsquos got style and medals  Katie Archibald is nothing  not colourful. Her hair has been just about every hue under the sun. Her left arm is tattooed by drawings from The Thinker of Tender Thoughts by the poet Shel Silverstein. On her right are the Olympic rings. Her love of motorbikes saw her crash at 70mph on a Cheshire lane in the run up to the Rio Olympics.  But in between all this colour and extracurricular drama, there are the races and that really cool thing she does which is to win medals \u0026ndash three at this year\u0026rsquos Commonwealth Games and she has her eyes on three, too, at the next Olympics in Tokyo 2020.  24 Bigg Taj  Beatboxer, 35  Why? His mouth is a drum machine  As a kid Bigg Taj started doing beatbox long before he knew what those sounds he was making were. Then, he says, \u0026ldquowhen I heard guys like Killa Kela, Rahzel and Scratch, I realised what it is and decided to pursue it. It\u0026rsquos been my passion for well over a decade, creating music with my mouth and pushing the boundaries of my vocals.  Now Scotland\u0026rsquos premier beatboxer, Bigg Taj, a Sikh of Indian heritage, has performed with his idols, supporting Method Man and Redman. But Bigg Taj isn\u0026rsquot just about the performance \u0026ndash he also runs a Youtube channel with beatbox tutorials and has been doing youth work for years. The workshops, he says, are about the creative writing and beatboxing, but they\u0026rsquore also about giving young people a space to talk. Among these, he says, is one in Polmont prison with rap emcee Spee Six Nine.  23 Claire Cunningham  Dancer, 41  Why? She alters the way we look at bodies, able or disabled  Dancer and choreographer Claire Cunningham\u0026rsquos extraordinary shows have always challenged how people feel about disability. When she dances on crutches \u0026ndash which she has used to walk since the age of fourteen \u0026ndash they become marvellous, magical and sometimes humorous extensions of herself. Her shows ask big questions. Guide Gods, for instance, looked at religious attitudes towards the disabled. Give Me a Reason to Live was based on the depiction of disability in the work of the painter Hieronymus Bosch. It was, she said, a live memorial to the disabled victims of the Nazi euthanasia program.  Cunningham was born with osteoporosis and arthrogryposis, but didn\u0026rsquot view herself as disabled until she went to university. Only later, when she came in contact with the choreographer Jess Curtis, did she realise that she might be able to dance, and that she had her own very special set of tools, her crutches.  Her most recent work, The Way You Look  Tonight is a collaboration with Curtis.  22 Richard Madden  Actor, 32  Why? Two words. The Bodyguard.  Richard Madden, without a doubt, is having his own special cool moment right now. It\u0026rsquos happening for him. The Bodyguard, in which he stars as Sergeant David Budd, is, according to the BBC, their \u0026ldquodrama of the decade.  At the bookies, the odds on him being the next Bond just got slashed to 10/1. He\u0026rsquos having to worry about being objectied and being seen as a hunk.  You can\u0026rsquot open a newspaper without coming across some article about who he is dating \u0026ndash actor Ellie Bamber \u0026ndash or what his latest movements have been. But, one of the coolest things about the Renfrewshire born actor, whose biggest role, previous to this was Robb Stark in Game Of Thrones, is that he clearly acknowledges he hasn\u0026rsquot always been cool. In one interview he confessed that  he weren\u0026rsquot acting he\u0026rsquod be a \u0026ldquoshy, fat kid living in Scotland with no girlfriend.  21 Shirley Manson  Singer, 52  Why? She\u0026rsquos not going to be owned by anyone  \u0026ldquoI actually feel that this is the most glorious part of my career, Manson said earlier this year. And it is, on many levels \u0026ndash not just because her band, Garbage, have stuck together for over twenty years, but because she\u0026rsquos being more outspoken, almost, now more than ever and she is showing younger artists the way to go. She has spoken out on #MeToo.  Earlier this year she wrote a moving op-ed in the New York Times about her experience of self harm. \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know I was a cutter until the first time I chose to cut, she wrote. \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot even know it was a \u0026lsquothing.\u0026rsquo..  Last month she had a go at the mainstream music industry, calling it \u0026ldquoexploitative. Along with Chvrches frontwoman, Lauren Mayberry, she is set to deliver the keynote speech at the annual South by Southwest conference next year \u0026ndash and you can bet it will be fizzing with feminism.  But above all, it\u0026rsquos glorious because of the raw power she still has a performer. Garbage performed at the Barrowlands earlier this month, and Peter Ross, reviewing the gig for The Times observed, \u0026ldquoShe was amped, vamped, pumped veins made a river delta on her temples."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-admits-to-getting-irritated-by-leadership-talk","story":"  The Prime Minister insisted she was focused on the country\u0027s future rather than her own, in a BBC interview to mark the six-month countdown to Brexit.  Mrs May criticised Mr Johnson for using \"completely inappropriate\" language when he described her Brexit strategy as putting the UK in a \"suicide vest\".  Around 50 Brexiteers met to war-game ways to oust the PM last Tuesday evening and Mr Johnson is widely-expected to vie to replace Mrs May.  Asked  she would reassure the Conservative Party she was not determined to go on and on, the PM told BBC Panorama\u0027s Inside No 10: Deal or No Deal?: \"I get a little bit irritated but this debate is not about my future, this debate is about the future of the people of the UK and the future of the United Kingdom.  \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m focused on and that\u0027s what we should all be focused on.  \"It\u0027s ensuring that we get that good deal from the European Union which is good for people in the UK, wherever they live in the UK, that\u0027s what\u0027s important for us ... It\u0027s the future of people in the UK that matters.\"  Mr Johnson faced a Tory backlash after comparing Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan to a \"suicide vest\" and his former communications director, Guto Harri, said on Saturday that his ex-boss was \"digging his political grave\".  Mrs May said the former Foreign Secretary\u0027s comments were \"not right\".  She went on: \"I have to say that that choice of language is completely inappropriate.  \"I was Home Secretary for six years and, as Prime Minister for two years now using language like that was not right and it\u0027s not language I would have used.\"  The PM was once described as \"bloody dficult woman\" by former Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, and later claimed the description as a badge of honour.  She told the programme that person was \"still there\" but there was a \u0026ldquodference between those who think you can only be bloody dficult in public and those who think actually you bide your time, and you\u0027re bloody dficult when the time is right and when it really matters.\""},{"url":null,"title":"a-good-week-for-the-eu-with-its-stance-on-hungary","story":"  Prime Minister Victor Orb\u0026aacuten of the ruling Hungarian Fidesz party came to Strasbourg to debate the criticisms in a resolution drawn up by Dutch MEP and my group colleague Judith Sargentini. If anyone needs a refresher it is worth remembering this is a man who has called migrants poison, referred to \u0026lsquomuslim invaders\u0026rsquo and peddled anti-Semitic myths about George Soros. His government, democratically elected it has to be said, has forcibly retired judges, banned international NGOs from working in Hungary, built a fence to keep out refugees and lots more besides.  As one academic succinctly put it this week \u0026ldquothe EU is like a club with a strong bouncer, but little security once you\u0026rsquore inside the venue. The present Hungarian government has not been abiding by the values that make up the EU, and the EU, slowly, had got round to acting. The Parliament, for the first time ever, was to debate the triggering of Article 7 proceedings, effectively putting Hungary in a sin bin cutting funding, limiting voting rights and other measures until it plays by the rules.  On the day he simply fell back on tired rhetoric asserting that the report \u0026ldquoinsults the honour of the Hungarian nation whilst feeding a victim complex that the Parliament had already made up its mind. He fell back on anti-immigration rhetoric repeatedly talking about migrants whilst ignoring all other criticisms proudly proclaiming that \u0026ldquothe Hungarian people have decided not to be a nation of migrants.  Remember, Hungary signed up to the values of the EU when it joined and these values are part of the organisation. These include the rights of iniduals and the EU institutions must defend them where possible, particularly in the face of the threats we now face. Europe is a continent of migrants and  our history shows us anything it is that narrow minded anti-immigrant rhetoric always ends badly.  Unsurprisingly his speech fell flat. MEPs from the centre right EPP, the centre left S\u0026ampD, the liberal ALDE and Green groups all stood one by one to condemn his government\u0026rsquos actions and at the end of the day with 448 votes in favour the European Parliament voted to recommend the initiation of Article 7 proceedings. This is a real strong sign that EU values must be respected and could result in Hungary being stripped of its right to vote in the Council of the European Union.  The details of the resolution that we approved are grim reading. The Budgetary Control Committee recommends deduction of EU funding to Hungary over concerns that much of it ends up in the pockets of his cronies the Culture Committee condemns attacks on academic freedom the Constitutional Affairs Committee condemns infringement of judicial independence the Committee on Women\u0026rsquos Rights condemns reversals on gender equality.  This week\u0026rsquos debate got to the heart of what the EU is for. To what extent should the sovereign EU states be able to pick and choose from the common rules they all voluntarily signed up to? To what extent should the rest of us be able to call them on it? Can solidarity be imposed?  None of these have simple answer, and in the EU everything is connected to everything else, that\u0026rsquos the point. Recently, in Greece a profligate series of Greek governments tipped their economy into chaos, and it was only EU support that avoided a worse disaster. But could, should, the EU have been gentler with the Greek people themselves? I would say yes, but then, why should my taxpayers in Scotland pay for irresponsible profligacy at the other end of the continent?  Catalonia too has shown that the EU is ultimately a club of member states and there is work to do. There\u0026rsquos a democratic discussion that needs to be promoted between Barcelona and Madrid and the EU has not stepped up, though I hope it may yet. At least on Hungary, this week the Parliament has stood up for democracy and the rule of law.  However, in the face of this overwhelming display of what the EU can be, there were still 197 members of our European Parliament that opposed taking action against Mr Orb\u0026aacuten. My greatest shock comes not from UKIP and the Front National, you\u0026rsquod expect it of them, but from the UK Conservatives who were the only governing right-wing party to support him.  They voted to support the policies and the man, in the face of everything he stands for. My most charitable explanation is that this shows the chronic weakness of the UK post-Brexit as its government desperately cuddles up to anyone who might provide some help irrespective of morals or long-term strategic cost. At its worst this is a sign that the Conservative party is shting hard to the right and anything goes.  I think it is the latter and increasingly I do not think you can describe the Conservatives as a centre-right party. The clues are in the company they keep. It was because of an ill thought out commitment to appease the right in David Cameron\u0026rsquos 2005 leadership campaign that the party left the centre-right EPP group of the parliament and set up their own. Earlier this year they invited the anti-migrant Swedish-Democrats to join them. Yes, the party that was the focus of so much concern in last weekend\u0026rsquos Swedish election are happy members of the same Group as Mrs May\u0026rsquos Tories.  Unfortunately, the rhetoric of our Prime Ministers also fits with that of the hard right. David Cameron talked about \u0026ldquoswarms of migrants. In the debate this week Mr Bay of the French Front National said that \u0026ldquothe EU promotes multiculturalism, against out values. How is that so dferent from Mrs May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquo you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere?  I fear for the Tories and for what they may turn into. I fear for what that means for the rest of us  we\u0026rsquore stuck in a brexit Britain run by them. Right now there is a fight going on in constituency branches across the UK. This is a fight for the soul of their party and I fear the old fashioned \u0026lsquosmall c\u0026rsquo liberal Conservatives are losing. There are still those fighting but they are increasingly cast out or in a minority. The MEPs Richard Ashworth and Julie Girling voted against Orb\u0026aacuten but they have already felt the need to leave the Conservative group in the Parliament. Only one actual Tory MEP voted against Orb\u0026aacuten and I want to end by praising Nosheena Mobarik, Conservative MEP for Scotland. She not only voted with us and her conscience, she defied what I\u0026rsquod guess was a pretty tough London imposed group whip as well. I hope her colleagues across the UK will look to her action, ask themselves some hard questions and set about challenging those who are changing the Tory party into something they find unthinkable. Their silent acquiescence has implications for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-high-streets-in-the-running-to-be-named-best-in-the-uk","story":"  The retail hotspots are all in the running to win a \u0026pound15,000 prize as part of the Great British High Street Awards 2018.  The Scottish high streets shortlisted for the overall champion category include: Alness High Street, Ross and Cromarty A77 Pollokshaws/Kilmarnock Road corridor, Glasgow Turrf High Street, Aberdeenshire Kirriemuir High Street, Angus Kirkwall High Street, Orkney and Newport-on-Tay High Street, Fe.  Newport-on-Tay is also in the running for the rising star award, as well as Prestwick Main Street and Ayr High Street.  The categories will now be put to a public vote, which counts for 30 per cent of the final score, before being looked at by a judging panel.  High Streets Minister Jake Berry MP said: \u0026ldquoCongratulations to all 38 high streets shortlisted for this year\u0026rsquos Great British High Street Awards.  \u0026ldquoThe awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding.  \u0026ldquoOver the next six weeks they have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they also battle it out in a public vote for the title of Britain\u0026rsquos best high street.  \u0026ldquoThis is a great opportunity to show your support for all the hard work taking place on our high streets, so get voting.  The shortlist comes after recent research by credit card firm Visa, which sponsors the awards, showed signs of renewed confidence in the country\u0026rsquos high streets despite a challenging retail environment.  The findings revealed that more than a third  of Scotland\u0026rsquos independent high street retailers are optimistic about the future of their local high street, while almost four out of five  Scottish shoppers claim they would miss their local high street  it was no longer there.  Sundeep Kaur, head of UK \u0026amp Ireland Merchant Services at Visa, said: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the nation\u0026rsquos high streets are transforming, this year\u0026rsquos Great British High Street Awards shortlist contains some fantastic examples of high streets and merchants which are evolving and embracing change to attract visitors.  \u0026ldquoIt is genuinely heartening to see so many businesses and communities that are harnessing their adaptability, resilience and creativity to offer the services and experiences that today\u0026rsquos shoppers want.  Author and TV presenter Simon Reeve, who will act as a judge, added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove spent the last couple of months visiting independent high street retailers across the UK and I\u0026rsquove been blown away by the passion and commitment shown by shopkeepers to keep their high streets alive, especially in this challenging climate.  \u0026ldquoThe best examples are those that are listening closely to their customers and innovating to meet their demands. These are the shops and high streets that will stand the test of time.  A total of 38 high streets have been shortlisted for the 2018 awards, which are organised by the Ministry of Housing, Communities \u0026amp Local Government.  The public and the judges will select an overall UK winner, as well as a winner from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for each of the two categories: the Champion and Rising Star awards.  The UK champion will receive a \u0026pound10,000 grant for a local community project, while each of the inidual country winners will receive \u0026pound5000 towards a street party.  The Rising Star winners will each receive \u0026pound5000 towards a local community project.  The results will be revealed at an awards ceremony in London on November 15.  Anyone looking to vote in the awards can do so at www.thegreatbritishhighstreet.  Previous winners of the best high street award include Blackburn in 2016, Bishy Road in York in 2015, and Norwich Lanes in Norfolk in 2014.  The awards did not take place last year."},{"url":null,"title":"sketch-perhaps-its-time-for-those-too-nice-lib-dems-to-get-nasty","story":"  The question arises as it seems dferent Liberal Democrats have dferent takes on just how being in bed, politically speaking of course, with the likes of David Cameron and George Osborne during those oh-so-stable Coalition years really was.  For example, step forward Jo \u0026ldquosoon to be the next party leader, possibly, perhaps, Swinson, who claimed the yellow peril \"lost too many arguments\" when hooked up to the terrible Tories and the compromises they agreed to simply \"sucked\".  \u0026ldquoWhen they fought dirty, we were too nice, declared the champion from East Dunbartonshire.  \"And austerity left behind people who Liberals are in politics to protect.\"  Yet, the Coalition knight from Kingston, Sir Ed Davey, the former Energy Secretary, popped onto the press room to tell the small but perfectly formed merry band of hacks attending conference what a wonderful experience the Lib-Con partnership had been and he was \"deeply, deeply proud\" of the \u0026ldquoamazing things achieved during that golden period.  Elsewhere, the nice, happy-clappy Army of Lib Dems, wearing EU-starred berets, yellow T-shirts and even yellow shorts \u0026ndash I kid you not \u0026ndash gathered for Uncle Vince\u0026rsquos fireside chat.  One question echoed Ms S\u0026rsquos point: are the Lib Dems too nice?  Uncle Vince admitted niceness was a \u0026ldquotemperamental failure we all have and agreed with Ms S that perhaps the Lib Dems could have been \u0026ldquonastier and more aggressive with the Cameroons. Surely not.  But he said that the best way to deal with the likes of Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg was not to imitate them. \u0026ldquoGod forbid, we should engage in that kind of crude gutter populism, declared the big V.  He insisted part of the yellow peril\u0026rsquos appeal was that it rejected that \u0026ldquosimple-minded approach to politics, that looks for scapegoats.  He then declared, ironically, to loud applause: \u0026ldquoWe shouldn\u0026rsquot be betraying our values simply to make a big noise.  Also during the Q\u0026ampA, Uncle Vince was asked  the Lib Dems should think of getting into bed again with the Tories or Labour. The party leader didn\u0026rsquot blink before insisting to cheers: \u0026ldquoThe simple answer is no.  Noting how the current iding line between his party and the Corbyn comrades and the May marauders not just on Brexit but a whole range of issues was \u0026ldquoenormous.  \u0026ldquoYou have a very right wing authoritarian Conservative Party - and that\u0026rsquos ignoring the extremes - and you have the Labour Party, which is in this absolutely appalling state, where even many of its own MPs dissemble.  There was \u0026ldquoabsolute no prospect of a 2010-style coalition, declared Uncle Vince. So there.  Whether the earth will move in Brighton during this week\u0026rsquos conference is a moot point but  the party is to rise up the polls, perhaps those nice Lib Dems will finally have to engage in some political rough and tumble."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7797102.jpg?type=article-full","title":"majority-of-scots-want-holyrood-to-control-immigration","story":"  A poll shows that 64% of Scots back immigration devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland giving them powers to decide how many visas are issued for people who want to work there.  A new report says just one in ten Scots think that the UK government has managed immigration competently and fairly and the authors say urgent action is need to restore public trust. Across the UK they are slightly more supportive with only 15% backing Britain\u0027s handling of immigration.  The figures come from the largest-ever public consultation on immigration, ahead of the independent Migration Advisory Committee\u0026rsquos immigration report on Tuesday expected to be pivotal to shaping Theresa May\u0026rsquos post-Brexit immigration policy.    Nicola Sturgeon has made repeated calls for a Scottish-specic immigration system in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.  But the Home Office believes that applying dferent immigration rules to dferent parts of the UK would complicate the system, harming its integrity, and cause dficulties for employers who they say need the flexibility to deploy their staff to dferent parts of the UK.  It says that it will engage with and consider the views of the Scottish Government and businesses when deciding on any action over the MAC findings.  The new report from the National Conversation on Immigration, co-ordinated by think tank British Future and anti-prejudice campaigners HOPE not hate, said that even the English agreed that Scotland should take control.  Some 55% across the UK said the devolved governments should have powers over immigration. The policy is also supported by half of those who live in the Midlands  and the south east  and by Leave  and Remain  voters.    Stuart McDonald, the SNP spokesman on immigration, asylum and border control said: \u0026ldquoThe support for devolution of migration powers recorded by the National Conversation is hugely signicant and welcome. Not only in Scotland, but across the UK, people have had enough of one-size-fits-all migration rules and do not believe that the UK government will deliver competent or fair migration policies.  \u0026ldquoIt is more urgent that ever for the UK government to devolve migration powers to the Scottish Parliament, so we can build a system that is designed to meet Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and aspirations \u0026ndash for example, a post-study work visa, rules that allow families to stay together, and visas that encourage people to work, start businesses and invest here.  The First Minister has argued that Scotland needs power over immigration to attract more people north of the border where there is a rapidly ageing population.    But earlier this month, CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn, one of the most influential figures in British industry said that businesses are not ready for a separate Scottish immigration system.  Earlier this month, the Home Secretary unveiled a pilot scheme that will allow fruit and vegetable growers to recruit non-EU migrants as seasonal workers - but critics say it goes \"nowhere near\" far enough to plug a recruitment crisis in Scots fruit-picking industry.  The new report calls for an annual \u0026lsquoMigration Day\u0026rsquo in Parliament, where ministers are held accountable for their performance against a three-year immigration strategy that it says should replace the annual net migration target, and would have input from the devolved administrations.    Jill Rutter, director of strategy for British Future and co-author of the report, said: \u0026ldquoThe lack of trust we found in the government to manage immigration is quite shocking. People want to have their voices heard on the choices we make, and to hold their leaders to account on their promises.  \u0026ldquoWhile people do want the UK Government to have more control over who can come to the UK, most of them are \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash they recognise the benefits of migration to Britain, both economically and culturally, but also voice concerns about pressures on public services and housing.  Rosie Carter of HOPE not hate, co-author of the report, added: \u0026ldquoImmigration is a national issue, but people see it through a local lens. Where people live, and their living conditions, makes a real dference \u0026ndash that includes the perceived impact of migration on their community, broader grievances about economic insecurity and levels of contact with migrants and ethnic minorities too.  \u0026ldquoAn official National Conversation on Immigration would give people a chance to express their concerns in a constructive debate, so anxieties are not driven underground or exploited by those seeking to stoke ision.    The research by ICM for the National Conversation, which polled 700 people in Scotland also found Scots were more positive about integration with 69% agreeing \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants commit to stay in Britain, put down roots and integrate, compared to 61% UK-wide.  And just 31% in Scotland agree that \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants come here to work for a few years without putting down roots and then  home\" against 39% UK-wide.  But the report also uncovered some dissenting voices in citizens\u0027 panels held across Scotland.  In four of the five citizens\u0026rsquo panels in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh and Paisley \u0026ndash some participants felt that international students were taking the place of Scottish students.  \"This view was more surprising, given that these four citizens\u0026rsquo panels held many positive views about other forms of migration,\" said the report.  Students who live in Scotland or are from EU countries do not have to pay tuition fees in Scottish universities.    \"This seems to have fuelled a belief that Scotland\u0026rsquos universities prioritise international students from outside the EU over Scottish students for financial reasons,\" said the report.  \"However, our nationally representative ICM survey did not indicate any statistically signicant dference in the desire to reduce the number of international students in Scotland  compared with all of the UK .\"  And some over two out of three Scots were happy for the numbers of international students to be increased or remain at the same level.  The Home Office said: \"Our immigration system is designed to work for the whole of the UK. We have no current plans to introduce a devolved immigration system.  \"Scotland, as well as other devolved governments, have dferent ways available to encourage more iniduals and families to move to their part of the UK.  National Conversation on Immigration researchers held over 130 meetings in 60 locations across every nation and region of the UK, with citizens\u0026rsquo panels, recruited to be representative of the local population, in each place alongside meetings with local government, businesses, faith and civil society groups.  In Scotland, panels were held in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Lerwick and Paisley.  Nationally representative research by ICM polled 3,667 people across the UK and an open online survey was completed by nearly 10,000 people.  Other Scottish findings  \u0026bull 62% agree that migrant workers support the British economy by doing jobs British people don\u0026rsquot want to do  \u0026bull 51% agree that public services are under strain because of immigration  \u0026bull 64% agree that migrants bring valuable skills for our economy and public services like the NHS  \u0026bull 51% agree that migrants are willing to work for less money so put jobs at risk and lower wages  \u0026bull 80% think the number of high-skilled migrants from the EU should remain the same or increase while 11% say they should be reduced.  \u0026bull 47% would like the number of low-skilled workers from the EU to be reduced while 34% think they should stay the same and 9% would like more.  \u0026bull 63% agree that the public should be consulted more on important national issues, like immigration.  Analysis:\u0026nbspScottish public are balancers  by Jill Rutter, Director of Strategy for British Future and co-author of the National Conversation on Immigration final report.    Immigration was one of the biggest issues of the EU referendum, but the public have not had a chance to say what should happen next.  The National Conversation on Immigration, jointly conducted by British Future and Hope not hate, is the largest ever public consultation on immigration.  Holding sixty citizens\u0026rsquo panels across the UK, including five in Scotland and a mixed English-Scottish panel in Berwick, it was a chance to hear the public\u0026rsquos voice.  These real-world conversations were constructive and pragmatic, in sharp contrast\u0026nbspto the more polarised online debate. We heard dferent views across Scotland: in Paisley, local faith and political leadership had shaped a public discourse that was more sympathetic to refugees and migrants than in similar places south of the border.  In Aberdeen, awareness of migration\u0026rsquos contribution to the oil industry was mixed with concerns about pressures on school places and housing. The Berwick citizens\u0026rsquo panel showed that views on migration can be toughest in places of low ersity and least contact.  Scotland has a distinctly more positive national immigration discourse. The Scottish public are balancers, seeing the gains of migration for the NHS and economy and wanting practical plans to manage the pressures too.  Asked to rate the overall impact of immigration on a 1-10 scale, the most common Scottish response is six out of ten, with a modest dference between the Scottish  and UK-wide  averages.  Views about whether Scotland should have more control over immigration policy often ided along independence referendum lines. There was more support in Paisley, while citizens in the Shetlands were firmly opposed.  But the sense that Westminster is distant and unlikely to consider Scotland\u0026rsquos needs transcends the independence question: a pro-Union panel in Edinburgh felt the City of London would dominate in decisions about future policy.  So 64% of Scots support devolving immigration powers, according to the survey that formed part of the National Conversation.    While political, business and civic society stakeholders saw a clear demographic need for immigration in Scotland, it was striking how the public were barely aware of the debate about future population needs. Scotland\u0026rsquos immigration \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo will be ready to hear that case, but a sustained national conversation on Scotland\u0026rsquos demographics will be needed for elite debate to be converted into a public one."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/1934845.jpg?type=article-full","title":"students-backlash-over-call-to-make-scots-pay-for-university-education","story":"  A university principle, speaking on condition of anonymity, said \u0026ldquoit is time to look at a gradual increase in tuition fees for Scottish students - or at least consider it, as the current funding model is \u0026ldquounsustainable.  But Liam McCabe, the president of the National Union of Students in Scotland,\u0026nbsp said there should be more not less support for Scotland\u0026rsquos students, so that they are not burdened with debt.  Mr McCabe said:\u0026ldquoNUS Scotland has and always will assert that education is a right, not a privilege. It should be ability that determines how far students go in education, not the depth of their pockets - and it\u0026rsquos right that the Scottish Government remains committed to free tuition.    \u0026ldquoUniversity bosses would do well to join NUS in making the case for increased government investment in Scotland\u0026rsquos students, especially those from the poorest backgrounds, rather than burdening them with thousands of pounds of new debt.  Scottish students get free university tuition in Scotland, as do students from other EU countries, but those from England, Wales and Northern Ireland have to pay to study there.  In February, the Scottish government extended the guarantee of free tuition for EU students to those starting in the 2019 to 2020 academic year.  Eligible students will have their fees met for the duration of their studies, even after the UK leaves the EU.  In England the fees cost up to \u0026pound9,250 per year, making it the most expensive place to study in Europe.  Now academics have publicly stated that Scottish society should be open to debating university funding.  Elizabeth Smith, the Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman, said: \u0026ldquoI am not surprised by these calls, particularly at a time when there are many issues about the SNP\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquocapped places\u0026rsquo policy.  \u0026ldquoWe are seeing increasing numbers of well qualied, domiciled Scots not being able to get into Scottish universities of their choice even when places on the relevant courses are still available.  That cannot be right.  \u0026ldquoIf Scotland\u0026rsquos universities are to maintain their competitive advantage at the same time as enhancing academic standards and widening access, they require additional levels of income.    However, Colin McAllister, a special adviser to Nicola Sturgeon, said the Scottish Government was told that free tuition was \u0026ldquounsustainable when they last had the debate ten years ago.  \u0026ldquoDespite UK austerity and a recession we sustained it and Scottish universities remain world class, he said.  \u0026ldquoHow will pro-fee voices explain that away I wonder?  Peter Mathieson, the principal of Edinburgh University, said fees might have deterred him from attending university in his youth but acknowledged high-quality tuition is \u0026ldquoexpensive.  \u0026ldquoWhether it is paid for by tuition fees, governments or loans, that is a debate we can have in society.  Mathieson said he did not want the fear of debt to deter students from higher education.  However, he said: \u0026ldquoThe idea that we\u0026rsquove got to make sure higher education is attainable - for me that doesn\u0026rsquot immediately translate into an ideological argument over tuition fees.  He added: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a school leaver my ability to tolerate debt was very limited, the reality for a lot of school leavers now is that  they are going to go to university they need to be able to tolerate debt. That\u0026rsquos an issue we can\u0026rsquot hide from.  Jim McDonald, principal of Strathclyde University, said: \u0026ldquoIn order to attract and retain the best academic talent and best students from home and abroad, we need to make sure that higher education is properly funded.    Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, the principal of Glasgow University, said \u0026ldquosociety will periodically go through this debate about free tuition, but warned the majority of Scots are unlikely to back a change in policy.  \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos not kid ourselves, you see the debate in England - fees were introduced and now people are saying perhaps some of this should be publicly funded, he said.  Professor Muscatelli insisted Scottish universities are in \u0026ldquogood company with leading European countries in giving free tuition to home students.  \u0026ldquoOur sector is highly competitive given the substantial investment from the Scottish Government and leverages additional economic benefits for Scotland, he said, adding that an important thing for the sector is \u0026ldquosustainability of funding\".  John Swinney, Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary, said he \u0026ldquolooked at tuition fees through the lens of values.  \u0026ldquoThe values I associate with education is that society should benefit from collective investment in the educational development of our population - that is the moral purpose of education, he said.  \u0026ldquoWhat comes with that is a commitment to make sure that universities are properly and effectively funded, and that is the very firm commitment we have given to our institutions.  He rejected claims that that the SNP has \u0026lsquocapped places\u0026rsquo for Scottish student numbers \u0026mdash a policy which is said to have limited access to university for poorer students.    \"What is important is that we make sure there are no barriers in the way of young people from a range of backgrounds gaining access to university education, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely committed to the policy of no tuition fees approach to university for Scottish students and that will remain the commitment of the SNP Government.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snps-brendan-ohara-calls-on-chancellor-to-continue-duty-freeze-on-scotch-whisky","story":"  Nationalist MP Brendan O\u0026rsquoHara, who chairs Westminster\u0026rsquos all-party parliamentary group on scotch whisky, echoed industry concerns, saying it was vital that businesses and sectors were protected and not burdened with a counterproductive and unnecessary tax hike.  He said: \u0026ldquoScotch whisky is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos major assets and a global success story. At a time of continued Brexit uncertainty and instability, we cannot risk or undermine our whisky industry by increasing the tax liability on our producers who are already contributing so much.  \u0026ldquoDespite the Treasury predicting lost revenues of \u0026pound225 million from the November duty freeze, they actually rose by \u0026pound113m. By contrast, when the Treasury increased revenues the previous March by 3.9per cent, revenues dropped by 7.2 per cent. Scotch whisky cannot be forced to bankroll the UK\u0026rsquos failing economic strategy, declared the Argyll and Bute MP.  \u0026ldquoFor too long the Treasury has viewed the industry as a \u0026lsquocash cow\u0026rsquo, as evidenced by last year\u0026rsquos counterproductive duty hike. That approach must come to an end and I call on the Chancellor to rule out unnecessary tax hikes and instead take heed of the economic reality and retain the duty freeze on scotch whisky to ensure that this vital Scottish industry continues to grow, he added.  The SNP stressed that scotch whisky was responsible for approximately a fth of UK food and drink exports and recently reported record numbers of visitors to distilleries and tourist centres. The industry supported more than 40,000 jobs directly and through its supply chain, it noted.  The Scotch Whisky Association \u0026ndash the sector\u0026rsquos trade body \u0026ndash has already said that a continued freeze would \u0026ldquonot only deliver greater revenue for the Treasury but also help to support an industry that has invested more than \u0026pound500m in capital projects over the last five years.  The Budget date is not yet known and it is thought Mr Hammond is waiting to name a date until there is clarity over the success or otherwise of the Brexit talks.

The city had its first newspaper in late 1715, when the Glasgow Courant opened for business. In 1783 came the weekly Glasgow Advertiser, which in 1805 changed its name to the Glasgow Herald.  Now all of the city\u0026rsquos newspaper, book and commercial printing history has been assembled in the Glasgow Print Trail, a booklet and -  there is sufficient interest - a guided, physical trail for visitors to follow.  Maps in the booklet show the geographical spread of printing businesses. Many were clustered in the city centre. Among them were the Foulis Press, 18th century publishers to Glasgow University, in Shuttle Street, and Bell \u0026amp Bain, book and periodical publishers, which was established in Glasgow Cross in 1831 and would later spend a century in Mitchell Street.  But many others were to be found outwith the city centre, including John Cossar \u0026amp Co, in Govan.  Edinburgh\u0026rsquos printing industry pre-dates Glasgow\u0026rsquos by at least a century. A Print Trail has already been published, covering the capital.  The booklet is the work of the Scottish Printing Archival Trust, with funding from the Watson Foundation, which was established by John Watson OBE, who for more than half-a-century ran the well-known printers, John Watson and Company.  \u0026ldquoI would say that during the era of Glasgow being the Second City of the Empire, printing was the third or fourth largest industry in the city in terms of numbers employed, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a huge employer in those days. You had McCorquodale\u0026rsquos, which opened a print works here in the 1870s, and Robert MacLehose, who was appointed printers to the university in 1872.  \u0026ldquoThere was such a number of printers. There were many small family businesses, certainly, but you had the big boys as well.  Among the newspapers represented on the Glasgow Trail are the Glasgow Herald and Evening Times, the Daily Mail, and the Daily Record.  Mr Watson describes the booklet as a labour of love.  \u0026ldquoHaving spent my entire working le in printing I wanted to make sure that the rich history of printing in Glasgow was not forgotten. It is a story undoubtedly worth telling, he said.  \u0026ldquoMost people involved with the printing industry would generally agree that there have been more fundamental changes in the last 50 years than in the preceding centuries since Johannes Gutenberg invented printing from movable type back in 1450.  \u0026ldquoThe pace of change has been unrelenting, and with technology and new processes, the ways of communicating the printed word have changed out of all recognition. Sadly the industry has, too, and many of the companies mentioned in the booklet have fallen by the wayside.  \u0026ldquoNowadays there are so many ways of viewing or receiving information rather than from books or newspapers.  He added: \u0026ldquoFor me, the print trail is a walk down memory lane and an attempt to ensure the history of printing is not lost as the years roll by. It really was crucial to the commercial success of Glasgow and I don\u0026rsquot want that strong heritage lost in the mists of time.  \u0026ldquoIt is worth remembering that Glasgow boasted the largest book printers in the world with William Collins \u0026amp Son printing many bestsellers, including the Bible in no fewer than 42 languages. It is well known in the printing industry that every second person one who lived in Bishopbriggs worked for Collins.  Mr Watson added: \u0026ldquoThe idea is that,  there is enough interest in the Glasgow trail, we will run a guided tour, probably starting in Buchanan Street, where the Glasgow Herald was based for many decades until 1980.  Fittingly, the print-trail booklet was printed, free of charge, by Bell \u0026amp Bain, one of the oldest surviving printers in the UK, which is now based in Thornliebank.  * The booklet, researched by archivist Helen Williams, is available via www.scottishprintarchive.org for \u0026pound5."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Times are grim enough    let s not scrap free university tuition","story":"  There are bound to be feelings of excitement and trepidation for students and their parents as the academic semester begins, with the high cost of studying in 2018 doubtless contributing to worries for both parties.

The Scottish Government has always robustly resisted calls to introduce a similar scheme, despite opponents arguing the position is hypocritical, since further education places have been cut to fund the policy.

Normally I\u0026rsquom all in favour of national conversations, especially about the things that really matter. But in this case, I find myself drawn to the opposite response: now is definitely NOT the time to be having this particular debate.  At a time when many of us are already losing sleep over the potentially horrying economic ramications of Brexit, having suffered years of pitul wage growth and the chipping away of conditions that followed the financial crash, do parents really deserve the worry of an additional \u0026pound36k in fees should their children be bright enough to be offered a place at university?

And make no mistake, before long \u0026pound9k a year  would be the reality. Those in favour of fees talk of a very gradual introduction at a low level, but as English students learned so brutally, such promises are easily thrown out with the bathwater alongside the principle of free education.  The fee brigade in Scotland  often talk of the continuing and shameful lack of young people from deprived backgrounds going on to university, and how free higher education subsidises the middle classes.  But it\u0026rsquos impossible to see how introducing \u0026pound9k a year fees will help these young people, especially when you look again to the experience of English students: despite a massive hike in course fees over a short period, in 2016 maintenance grants for the poorest were replaced with, yes, you guessed it, loans. I speak from experience as the first person in my family to go to university and the recipient of a full grant . I may still have decided to study had fees been in place, but I doubt I would have felt free to chose the academic path I did, one that enabled me to enjoy education for its own sake but also led me to the career I love.

In further extracts from her interview, Mrs May was pushed on whether or not she had ruled out giving a special immigration arrangement for EU citizens and replied: \"What we will be doing is putting forward a set of rules for people from the European Union and people from outside the European Union.\"  She went on: \"Parliament will vote for a deal because people will see the importance of a deal that maintains a good trading relationship with the EU but also maintains good co-operation in other areas but gives us the freedom to take the benefits and opportunities of Brexit.\"  The PM cast doubt on whether or not the EU would offer a better deal  MPs were to reject her final proposal, adding: \"I believe we\u0027ll get a good deal we\u0027ll bring that back from the EU negotiations, put that to Parliament.  \u0026ldquoThe alternative to that will be not having a deal because a I don\u0027t think the negotiations will have that deal, and b we\u0027re leaving on March 29 2019.\"  But Sir Nick Clegg, the former Deputy PM, accused Mrs May of presenting Britain with a \"con trick\" choice on Brexit.  He explained: \"It is a deep disservice to our democratic traditions to have a Prime Minister now saying: \u0027You\u0027ve got no choices left, it\u0027s my fudge or the abyss\u0027 that is not true. We always have more choices  only we are prepared to take them.  \"Of all the con tricks we have been subject to in this whole sorry Brexit saga - from the lies in the referendum to the so-called virtues of what is nothing more than an inelegant fudge in Chequers - the worst is now to come, declared the former Liberal Democrat leader, who will be back in the spotlight today as he addresses a fringe event at the party\u0026rsquos annual conference in Brighton.  Mr Clegg said: \"We\u0027re now going to be told: \u0027It\u0027s my way or no way\u0027 it\u0027s either the Chequers fudge or a sort of cataclysmic clf-edge.  \"The idea that the only thing this country should accept is a fudge or the abyss is not only an insult to the intelligence of British voters but it\u0027s simply not true.\"  Sir Nick insisted that his experience as an MEP taught him that Britain would be given more time by the EU to reflect on what it wanted to happen ahead of the slated withdrawal date of next March.  \u0026ldquoThe clock is ticking but the clock can definitely be changed, he declared. \u0026ldquoOne thing that is very elastic in Brussels is time. They\u0027ve got a name for it. It\u0027s called \u0027stop the clock\u0027 and it is provided for in the EU treaties.\"  The former DPM said the UK could tell Brussels: \"\u0026rsquoI\u0027m sorry, we\u0027ve got a bit stuck here, we need more time to straighten ourselves out and decide what we want to do next.\u0026rsquo\"  He called for a pause in the withdrawal process so that the UK could hold a \"People\u0027s Vote\" on Brexit.  Sir Nick was scathing about the current Brexit situation, saying: \"It\u0027s the equivalent of leaving your home, locking your front door, chucking your key away and having absolutely no idea where you are going next.\"  The former party leader, who lost his Sheffield seat at the 2017 General Election, said he had been holding talks with European leaders on the Brexit situation to ensure the UK had more choices on what to do about its relationship with the EU.  In her BBC interview broadcast tonight, Mrs May also said she gets \u0026ldquoirritated by the debate about her leadership and criticised Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos controversial \u0026ldquosuicide vest comment.  Britain is heading full throttle for a total write-off of Brexit  it continues with Theresa May\u0027s disastrous plans for the Irish border, Boris Johnson has claimed.  The former Foreign Secretary launched another broadside against the PM\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan, saying the Irish border backstop deadlock was being used to force the UK into becoming a vassal state and that the talks were on course to end in a \"spectacular political car crash\".  Mr Johnson argued that the EU\u0026rsquos fall-back position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland being \"annexed\" by Brussels.  Alternative plans set out by Mrs May would \"effectively\" keep Britain in the bloc, he declared.  However, the PM has said the counter-proposal to her Chequers plan is \"still a hard border\" and hers is the only way that does not \"carve up the United Kingdom\".  His comments came as reports suggested the EU was preparing to accept the use of technology to avoid the need for new border infrastructure.  Mr Johnson has backed proposals by the pro-Brexit European Research Group that physical checks can be done away from the border, without keeping the UK or Northern Ireland tied to EU customs rules.  Writing in The Daily , he said: \"If the Brexit negotiations continue on this path they will end, I am afraid, in a spectacular political car crash.  \"If we are to get out of this mess and get the great British motor back on track, then we need to understand the Irish backstop and how it is being used to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels.  The former Cabinet minister claimed the EU\u0027s backstop would leave a border down the Irish sea while the UK\u0027s proposal left it \"volunteering\" to \"remain effectively in the customs union and large parts of the single market until Brussels says otherwise\".  Both versions of the backstop were \u0026ldquodisastrous,\" argued Mr Johnson. \"One threatens the Union the other version - and its close cousin, Chequers - keep us effectively in the EU, as humiliated rules-takers.  \"We need to challenge the assumptions of both these Irish backstops, or we are heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit.  \"We are straining at the gnat of the Irish border problem - in fact we haven\u0027t even tried to chew the gnat - and we are swallowing the camel of EU membership in all but name,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"birthday celebration for charity knitter iris","story":"        A Rothienorman woman who knits items for charity is preparing to celebrate her 98th birthday.

In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.

A new plan to develop food and drink tourism in Scotland – aiming to deliver an additional £1 billion to Scotland’s economy by 2030 – was recently launched by Nicola Sturgeon. At the event, Peter Cook, Director of Food, Drink and Agriculture at Opportunity North East, updated those attending about Opportunity North East’s work within that sector.Jo Robinson, VisitScotland Regional Director, said: “I am delighted that representatives from so many businesses in East Aberdeenshire attended this event, which hopefully gave them real food for thought on the subject of rural tourism.“This region has tremendous assets and strengths that offer visitors a range of great experiences – from food and drink to farm shops, coasts to castles and woods to wigwams. VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important. Hopefully events like this can help rural businesses to make the most of these opportunities.”                                                                                                        Gillian Martin, Aberdeenshire East MSP, said: “We have one of the most erse regions in Scotland with an abundance of historical and cultural signicance and interest.

September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low.

They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an inidual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be erted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwe whom you interviewed.Monday 17 Sep 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientic and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classication of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has

From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Monday 17 Sep 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman.

Without the support of the Youth Achievement Group I would never have had the confidence to apply for such an important opportunity.”Maureen Herdman  said: “We are delighted for Hope as this is a great opportunity for her to further advance her skills and confidence and represent young people on a national stage. It has been a delight to watch Hope develop into a self-assured and confident young lady who is always keen to represent the views and opinions of young people from Orkney and beyond!”Jack Norquoy said: \u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m absolutely delighted to be part of the panel to represent the work of SYP, young folk in Orkney, and crucially help to ensure we see a progression, not a regression of young people\u0026#8217s rights in Brexit. I\u0026#8217m looking forward to working with everyone on the panel to influence the Brexit process constructively. Our generation will inherit the full consequences of Brexit and I believe it is only right we have our voice heard.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously dficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

It\u0026rsquos certainly a possibility that there will be more launches in the area.

Data transfer is probably the easiest way of describing it. The launch was very successful.\"It was on a small scale but it was under real launch conditions.\"It\u0026rsquos the first one we have done and it went really well.\"It was a successful flight up to the expected altitude and we found the rocket again within the estate.\"The launch comes just weeks after the UK Space Agency identied Sutherland\u0026rsquos Moine peninsula \u0026ndash between Loch Eriboll and the Kyle of Tongue \u0026ndash as its planned location for a commercial space port.Monday 17 Sep 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The authors all call for an annual “Migration Day” in parliament where ministers are held accountable for their performance against a three-year immigration strategy - replacing the net migration target.: Humza Yousaf brands immigration policy cruelThey also want the government to start engaging directly with the public through an official National Conversation on Immigration run by the publicly funded Migration Advisory Committee.A spokesman for British Future said participants were asked about the level of trust in the government to manage immigration.But he added distrust has been building for 15 years following previous governments’ failure to predict the large amount of migration from recent entrants to the EU such as Poland and Romania.            Despite the low levels of trust in the present government’s ability to manage immigration, it found the majority of those involved held a more balanced view on the issue than is reflected in the media.Dubbed “balancers”, these respondents felt immigration brings economic and cultural gains to the UK, but also worry about control, fairness and pressures on public services.The research found 65% of people thought migrants bring valuable skills for the economy and public services such as the NHS, while 59% believed ersity is a good thing for British culture.A further 61% of people believed it is better for migrants to commit to remaining in the UK and to integrate, rather than coming to work for a few years before ing to their country of origin.On the other hand, 52% of respondents said public services are under strain as a result of immigration, and a further 52% believed migrants are willing to work for less - putting jobs at risk and lowering wages.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800841.1537167254!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith cross border business can show benefits of the union","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Scotland\u0026#8217s win-win with the UK goes beyond just economics Thank goodness for Robert Kilgour. By establishing Scottish Business UK, the serial entrepreneur has ensured that business leaders no longer feel intimidated by independence campaigners into keeping their counsel when the country\u0026#8217s economic future is at stake.                In the 2014 referendum, instances of Scottish-based businesses speaking out about what was in their interests to ensure success – and thus create jobs and spread prosperity – were noticeably few. Kilgour often found himself a lonely figure as the only businessman willing to openly challenge the economics of the Scottish Government’s White Paper, or debate on television and radio when he knew many that privately agreed with him.             The reasons for this were many some business organisations, be they national or representing inidual sectors, felt unable to take a position for or against breaking up the UK, so chose to say nothing. Some inidual businesses felt they might become targeted for boycotts or subject to negative publicity that would lose them customers and that, commercially, saying nothing made more sense. Some businesses relied on government contracts and had no wish to put themselves at risk.             After the referendum delivered its resounding defeat of independence, Robert Kilgour resolved that never again should the country’s businesses be put in such a marginal position. He decided there had to be a vehicle for business leaders with something to say, that had some useful insight to share with their employees, their customers and the wider society that benefits from the tax revenues their enterprises generate. Scottish Business UK was soon established and a board of Scots successful in their respective fields pulled together. Now Scottish Business UK is to publish tomorrow, on the fourth anniversary of the referendum that rejected independence, its first paper on why Scotland remaining in the UK is good for business. Entitled Win-Win, it argues Scotland profits in two ways, firstly through gaining signicant economic benefits that could not be improved upon but would be hugely diminished were Scotland to be outside the UK and secondly our locally-tailored public services can be more responsive to our particular needs while being underwritten through the “union idend”.The economic pluses might be obvious to many but still benefit from being repeated so they are never taken for granted. There is the tarf and regulatory free access to the UK single market for our goods, services and people, worth four times as much as the EU to our exporters. We are able to use the pound sterling at no cost to our businesses or citizens. And there is the “union idend” where beneficial fiscal transfers can ensure vital public services are maintained even when Scotland’s own tax revenues are lower than the costs of running them. Rather than deliver Westminster austerity, the union idend from the UK has helped us to avoid it. That idend was worth £11.1 billion last year – but the fact it exists rather than its amount is the most important benefit.We also know that £45.8bn or 65 per cent of all Scottish exports go to the rest of the UK, compared to £12.7bn or 17 per cent to the rest of the EU and a larger £17.1 or 20 per cent to the rest of the world. The Fraser of Allander Institute estimates that while 125,000 Scottish jobs are supported by trade with the EU, there are 529,000 Scottish jobs supported by trade with the rest of the UK.What this tells us is that , as the Scottish Government says, we are to be concerned about the loss of frictionless trade with the EU single market following Brexit, then the risk to Scottish trade, jobs and prosperity is proportionately four times greater.             Furthermore, once the UK leaves the EU on 29 March next year, any deal that is agreed between the EU and UK would not automatically transfer to Scotland were it to subsequently become independent. Scotland would need to negotiate its own deal or obtain full or associate membership – paying its own membership fee, agreeing to adopt the Schengen border scheme and eventual membership of the Euro. All of these issues could impact upon the friction-free trading arrangements with the UK. Nor would negotiations be easy, Scotland’s hand would be weaker than the UK’s has been and we would need to repair relationships with countries such as Spain – or see any agreement being vetoed. Economically the optimal arrangement is to remain in the UK and benefit from all of its strengths.Scotland remaining in the UK is not just about economics, however, it is about the close personal ties that have built up over the last 300-plus years, our shared culture and history – and how the soft power and opportunities that come from being inside the UK, and often from leading it at the political or business level, are of great value too.            A timely reminder of how economic benefits come from more than just trade came with the opening of the V\u0026ampA Dundee at the weekend. Much economic as well as cultural profit is expected in Dundee from the new gallery – and yet little acknowledgement has been given to the fact that V\u0026ampA Dundee is a member of the British institution and that its beneficial arrival could not have been realised in the same manner were Scotland outside the UK. Of course Dundee’s V\u0026ampA pays testimony to the cultural legacy of Scots such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Scotland’s contribution to design more generally, but as a member of the V\u0026ampA family the recognition of that contribution is elevated – while the sharing of the V\u0026ampA’s rich British archives is also made possible.Likewise, the ious city deals that are being signed off between the Scottish and UK governments – bringing over £1bn of UK funding that is outside the Scottish block grant or the Barnett Formula shows that there can be further benefits to what was being anticipated even a decade ago. The UK continues to evolve and change and Scotland can both shape that change and gain from it.Scottish business in the UK is indeed a win-win opportunity. If Robert Kilgour and his team can publish more reports that bring to our attention the quiet or untold advantages of Scotland remaining a full and active member of the UK, then his challenging experiences in the referendum will have been worthwhile.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800192.1537168158!/image/image.jpg","title":"christine jardine snp needs to make good on this vital broken promise","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Local authorities cannot afford to fix potholes and a myriad of local problems, but replacing the council tax with a land-value tax could make a real dference, writes Christine Jardine.                Sometimes politicians can be guilty of only thinking about the big picture, blue sky thinking, always looking up.            Well in Edinburgh, at the moment, that can be dangerous. Simply because you are likely to trip.            Our pavements are awful, in some places dangerous. The potholes we all complain about are not confined to the roads, which, incidentally, can also affect pedestrians and cyclists.And with winter approaching, it’s probably going to get worse.I’m sure you are probably wondering what has provoked this mini-rant? Unless, of course, you live in Edinburgh, in which case you will already know.In fact,  you live anywhere in Scotland you can probably appreciate exactly what I’m talking about.The problem was epitomised for me a couple of weeks ago when I was invited to a meeting of tenants in sheltered housing in Corstorphine.            On my way there, I had to pick my way carefully around a large pothole in the road and over an uneven – and, for the elderly, treacherous – pavement.At the meeting itself, the problems the state of the pavements was causing for residents was the main topic of discussion.And the residents, housing association and the local councillor were in complete agreement: it needs fixed.But here’s the problem. None of the people in the room, myself included, actually control the issue which is the root of the problem.            It’s the council tax and, in Edinburgh, the garden tax and the fact that it doesn’t seem to matter how much more we pay it doesn’t seem to be enough to fix the problems.To be clear though, I don’t just blame our council for that.: Cost of living crisis sparks rise in council tax warrants, Labour claimsOh, the garden tax with its extra charge for taking away garden refuse is entirely down to the SNP/Labour Edinburgh City Council. But the fact that our council tax no longer stretches to fixing the roads, the pavements, providing full grit bins, in some places not even empty grit bins, keeping public toilets open or simply providing the level of council services that the public deserves – that’s a buck which stops on a completely dferent desk.For more than a decade, the SNP Government has failed to tackle the issue of properly funding our local authorities.            For most of the SNP’s time in office, they have frozen the council tax. For nine years, in fact, as costs to councils increased and what we paid didn’t.So even though the council tax might be increased now, the block grant from Holyrood gets reduced undermining any impact it might have.And you and I are paying the price. Literally. This is not the first time, or even close to it, that I’ve written to call for something to be done about the funding of councils and services.But, as this year’s budget negotiations approach, I still nurture a faint hope that the SNP will listen to those encouraging a less centralised and damaging approach to local authority funding.It’s a policy which makes it appear that they simply do not trust the local authorities to spend money, even those where, as in Edinburgh, they are in the administration.: SNP and Tories team up to defeat Green call to scrap council taxAnd it’s a financial power-grabbing approach which increasingly extends to adding strings to any area or form of funding – teacher numbers, for example.But it’s still the council tax that the majority of us have the most direct experience of, and whose impact we feel most closely.At first, most of us backed the idea of a temporary council tax freeze.That was partly because we were all trying to cope with the personal impacts of the financial crash, and this felt like a short-term measure to help us all.Then, of course, there was the fact that the SNP had been elected in 2007 on a platform of changing the system, introducing a local income tax. The then First Minister Alex Salmond had even calledthe council “unfair”, so we expected that they would be good as their word and reform it. Well, not so much it seems.Here we are ten years later with a system that isn’t fit for purpose, councils without the resources they need and a government without the political will to fix it.Is it that they somehow don’t have constituents whose cars have been damaged by potholes? Are there no elderly residents in their areas who have suffered broken bones falling on cracked or damaged pavements? Or is it that they just are not listening? If they do pay attention they will find that the paying public want something dferent. A couple of years ago, I thought that might actually happen. There was a cross-party commission which looked at local tax reform. But Nicola Sturgeon, who had been scathing of the existing system, ignored its recommendations and instead did some tinkering around the edges.Changing Bands E to H is not reform, it’s simply more of the same. It’s time we had proper root-and-branch reform of a system which is no longer fit for purpose. Be bold. Scrap it.Most of all, let go of the strings. Let the councils respond the way they know best – because they do know best – to local problems. There is already another radical, progressive, suggestion on the table: a land-value tax.Liberal Democrats believe there are a number of economic and social benefits that could be achieved and we should be investigating it. We already know that it works well in other countries.It encourages derelict land in urban areas to be brought back into use. And  you decide to improve or extend your property you are not penalised because the tax remains based on the value of the land it is on. What do we have to lose?Next time you are frustrated by the state of the pavements, lack of services or the way you are seeing the council hamstrung at every turn by the current system of funding, take a minute and think: maybe we should do it dferently?        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4796096.1536904995!/image/image.jpg","title":"richard leonard this is how we can fix scotland s broken economy","story":"        A Scottish economics education, five years working as an economist, followed by 20 years representing working people at the point of production in Scottish industry has afforded me a rare insight into the relationship between economic theory and practice.                It has also fired up my passion to bring about a real change and a radical rebalancing of power in the Scottish economy.            That’s why I was pleased to read two eagerly awaited reports on the future of the economy just published. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s  distinguished Commission on Economic Justice provides a radical and visionary plan for delivering change in a post-Brexit economy and the David Hume Institute’s  “Scotland’s Productivity Challenge” stimulates debate around a very practical agenda for change.            They complement and reinforce each other. Both reports serve as useful reminders of the importance of clarity in debate. The DHI report begins as it means to go on, “A country’s productivity is the single most important determinant of its average living standards and wealth.” The IPPR make a similar point “poor productivity ... holds back growth and holds down wages”.And both recognise the importance of long termism. So, the IPPR’s Commission notes that “the economy needs fundamental reform”, as the “weaknesses in productivity, investment and trade go back 30 years or more. They will not be addressed by incremental change or trying to ‘muddle through’.”This is refreshing. The challenges we face are deep-seated and they demand a new radicalism and vitality.There have, after all, been far-reaching changes to our economic structure over the last three decades. We have shted from being a nation of producers to being one of consumers. We have witnessed a continued contraction of manufacturing jobs and the total collapse of entire industries like mining.We have seen the emergence of a service-led economy and a consequent impact on our balance of trade and our national accounts, but also at a human level on working lives and the sustainability of local communities too.              : Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAnd we have seen a transformational loss of economic and industrial ownership and control from Scotland which has strained and broken accountability in our economy even further.Telling in the reports is an analysis that despite a high level of skills in the workforce and favourable terms of trade – we sell exports at relatively high prices compared to the imports we buy – our labour productivity and our labour force is being let down because we have low capital stock, that is we have low levels of business investment in machinery and equipment.Intriguingly, the IPPR conclude that low capital investment is exacerbated by the growth of the low-wage, precarious employment economic model. Business owners getting caught up in a downward business spiral of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.            Productivity in simple terms is measured as GDP per hour worked. The long hours culture is one of the reasons why both productivity and the quality of le is dragged down.One suggestion to tackle this is better parental leave entitlement and more holidays. I would not argue with this. But it is also long overdue that we revisit the UK opt-out of the European Union Working Time Directive, which means in Scotland alone more than a quarter of a million workers regularly work beyond a 48-hour week. We need to break away from this long hours’ culture, not only for the sake of our productivity, but also for the sake of our health, and health and safety.The answer to the productivity challenge and many other industrial questions from the political right is iniably tax cuts. But there is a sleight of hand here.Whilst the Tories have cut corporation tax from 26 pence to 19 pence, they have put up regressive taxes like VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent – hitting the poorest the hardest. So, there has been a redistribution of income and wealth, but just in the wrong direction.: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workers            Moreover, both reports eschew this tax-cutting agenda. The IPPR concludes “there is in fact little evidence that investment levels are signicantly influenced by corporation tax rates” – pointing to much higher rates in much more successful economies. The DHI’s finding is that the answer to Scotland’s productivity challenge is not to be found in tax cuts, but business research and development, investment in a stronger indigenous business base and better management.And they make clear that the Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance, including education, health, housing, planning, transport and economic development.At the start of this year, the Scottish Government published its assessment of Brexit’s effect on Scotland. Productivity was singled out as the largest factor in the reduction in our GDP, expected to contribute a 5.8 per cent drop in economic output.And there is little doubt that Brexit should inject some added urgency to tackle the long-term problem of Scotland’s productivity gap. It only serves to reinforce this need for a step change in how we do things. If we do not make this change in the context of Brexit, we will simply drt even further from the high-skill, high-wage economy Scotland needs. Increasing the level of productivity is key to achieving sustainable economic development, to raising incomes and to creating better quality jobs. Scotland is one of the better performing parts of the UK by measure of productivity, but it is still below the UK average. Much of the debate in the Scottish Parliament is regularly focused on what powers the current Government does not have rather than the ones that it does.The Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance. It is high time that at long last they were used.After all, the questions we now face are far too important to be left to economists alone to answer, and they certainly cannot be left to the present parties of government. If we are to bring about the real economic change we need, we will need to change our political priorities too.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800802.1537167645!/image/image.jpg","title":"gap between snp s 2014 plans and north sea revenue reaches 30bn","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The SNP should apologise for the growing black hole in the economic prospectus for independence as the shortfall in oil revenues reaches \u0026#16330 billion, Labour has demanded.                Projections in the Scottish Government’s White Paper on independence were more than ten times bigger than estimated revenue from taxes on North Sea oil and gas production in each of the past three years.            It means the shortfall in revenue is expected to reach £29.9bn by the end of this year.            On the eve of the fourth anniversary of the 2014 referendum, Scottish Labour’s economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie MSP claimed the figures confirm that the economic case for independence was “nothing more than snake oil” and “a lie”.Economic projections in the 2013 White Paper were based on Scottish Government models that predicted oil prices would be broadly stable for at least two years.However, the price of crude oil plunged in the second half of 2014, as the independence referendum reached its climax, nearly halving from 112 per barrel in June to 58  in December.Oil prices hit a low of 28 in 2016 before steadily rebounding to their current level of around 75.This summer saw the publication of the SNP’s Growth Commission report, which the party hopes will convince voters that it has a more realistic economic vision of independence.            Its author, Andrew Wilson, admitted that the White Paper had a robust oil price “baked into the numbers” in 2014 but promised that a future referendum would be fought with North Sea revenues treated “as a proper windfall”.“I can say with some certainty in terms of our own work that we’ll assume for the purposes of our projections that oil is producing zero revenues and therefore treat any revenues that we get from oil as a proper windfall to be used on intergenerational projects rather than spent on spending today,” Mr Wilson said last year.Ms Baillie said: “The SNP told voters that Scotland was on the cusp of a second oil boom, and that oil was simply a bonus when it came to the costs of independence. That was simply a lie.“Instead, the figures that Nicola Sturgeon campaigned on have a £30bn black hole in them.            “That would have led to turbo-charged austerity on an unprecedented scale, with huge cuts to schools, hospitals and social welfare programmes.“These figures were baked into the promises the SNP made to some of the poorest communities in our country. It was nothing more than snake oil.”Ms Baillie added: “Nicola Sturgeon should be apologising to the people of Scotland for misleading them on an industrial scale. Rather than attempt to ide the people of Scotland again with a referendum the country does not want, it is time the SNP focused on jobs, schools and hospitals.”The SNP’s Westminster economy spokeswoman Kirsty Blackman hit back, claiming that “Labour’s only contribution as ever is to do Scotland down”.“The people of Scotland deserve an apology from Labour – who shamelessly told us voting against independence would protect our EU membership but are now working hand-in-hand with the Tories to drag us off the Brexit clf edge against our will,” Ms Blackman said.            She added: “Tory and Labour plans for a hard Brexit are by far the biggest threat to Scotland’s economy and long-term prosperity – with the potential to cut Scottish GDP by up to 9 per cent, costing £12.7bn a year and putting around 80,000 jobs on the line.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800800.1537168509!/image/image.jpg","title":"john swinney ready to ignore parliament over p1 tests","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

They don\u0027t want a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.: ‘One track’ SNP won’t help stop Brexit - Jo Swinson\"The only proposal that\u0027s been put forward that delivers on them not having a hard border and ensures that we don\u0027t carve up the United Kingdom, is the Chequers plan.\"EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is drafting a new \"protocol\" text that includes the use of technology to minimise checks at the Irish border, according to The Times.Diplomatic notes seen by the paper state: \"The biggest unsolved problem is Northern Ireland. There is a political mobilisation in the UK in this regard.

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what,  any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nMonday 17 Sep 2018 11:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread  AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my we and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This signicantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport. Other high achieving subjects included: Applied Business 70%, English 80%, English Literature 92%, Engineering 70%, French 75%, Geography 79%, ICT 70%, Single Award Science 78%, Technology \u0026amp Design 91%, Drama 91%, Music 82%, BTEC Sport 91%\n  \nThe Principal noted that amongst the numerous excellent combinations of grades were children with special educational needs, and many personal best achievements. It was also very encouraging to note that 96% of all students in the year group achieved at least 5 grades in the A – E range.\n  \nCongratulations to top achievers: Kirsten McLeister - 5 A* and 3A, Craig Francey - 4A*, 4A, 1B and 1C and Charlotte McKay 1A*, 4A, 2B and 1C.\n  \nOther students with a profile of A - C grades in eight or more subjects included: Stuart Adams, Tori Agnew, Chloe Bleakley, Alan Clarke, Daniel Compton, Megan Davison, Laura Du Bois Pidgeon, Amy Ewart, Joy Forsythe, Rachel Greer, Abigail Harris, Timothy Hill, Korben Houston, Lynn Hughes, Deanna Johnston, Jamie Knox, Danielle Mahaffy, Tamzin McClenaghan, Adam McConnell, Grace McCullough, Emma McDowell, Thomas McFall, Megan McKay, Luke Neeson, Robbie O’Neill, Aimee Penney, David Saunderson, Chad Shaw, Joshua Shaw, Robyn Telford, Charlotte Waide, James Warwick, Leah Young. This, in addition to the list of students, too numerous to list, who achieved 7 top grades.\n  \nInterviews are currently underway at the College for Sixth Form places and/or advice for students on the next steps in their learning. Applications are also welcome from students from other schools.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

It’s always good craic, but our Cadets also put in some serious work, learning something new every week and stretching themselves with training that can lead to respected accreditations.  Acquiring those new skills – whether that’s a BTEC in Public Services or how to abseil off a clf – creates a real sense of achievement.  Importantly, it also gives our Cadets something signicant to put on their Personal Statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs and everyone comes away feeling positive about themselves.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“No-one can be good at everything, but we believe that everyone can be good at something and our hugely committed Adult Instructors make sure that every one of the Cadets under their care has the encouragement and opportunity to shine.”\n\nTeens from Cadet Detachments across County Antrim are already getting behind the membership campaign, preparing to welcome newcomers. \n\nCadet Sergeant Yasmin Andrews, who currently serves as her Majesty’s Lord Lieutenant’s Cadet for the County of Antrim, says, “We all know how much you can get out of being a Cadet, but we also know that it can be awkward to walk into somewhere new, knowing no-one.  Hopefully anyone coming along to check out our Detachment will see how friendly we all are and will feel welcome. … it’s up to us to persuade them to give Cadets a try!\n\n“We get to do the sort of outdoor stuff that can cost a fortune  you try to go it alone - mountain biking, climbing, marksmanship, abseiling and kayaking, plus we can do the Duke of Edinburgh Awards, work towards BTECs and we get the chance to go on Camp every year. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDromore Cadet Daniel Hooke agrees.  He says, “There’s so much happening that there really is something for everyone.  Most people find something they really enjoy and do well at but, even  you aren’t great at a particular activity, it’s always good craic having a go!”\n\nColonel McCammond adds, “Parents naturally want to give their children as many opportunities as possible but there have to be limits to withdrawals from the Bank of Mum \u0026amp Dad!  A key benefit of the cadet movement therefore is that all our activities are affordable or, even better, totally free … even the unorms are free all kids pay for is their footwear.\n\n“Cadet membership is open to boys and girls from age 12 to 18 and, right now, local Detachments are encouraging potential new members to come along and see for themselves what the Cadet movement has to offer. The earlier you join the more time you have to fit in all the experiences, but people shouldn’t be put off by the idea that they’ve maybe left it too late.

Certainly, for most people, there will be a Detachment within easy reach, and we are hoping that we’ll see plenty of potential new members coming along to check us out, without any obligation to make a commitment. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Mums and dads are welcome to come along too, to see what the kids are getting involved with … and we’re hopeful that we may even be able to persuade some intrepid parents to consider working with us as Adult Volunteers!

mary s say goodbye to mr timothy doyle","story":"\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n\n                \nTimothy dedicated 30 years of his le to the teaching profession and shared his expertise and knowledge with pupils, teachers and parents.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe had a passion for Mathematics and imparted a love of this subject to all who had the privilege of knowing him. It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional le. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘le and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"celebrating irish language","story":"\n\nNOMINATIONS\n are still open for The Outstanding Contribution to the Irish Language Award in this year’s Aisling Awards.\n\nThis award celebrates the vibrancy and uniqueness which the Irish language brings to the city of Belfast, the award will honour an organisation or person who works tirelessly to pioneer the language.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day  it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identied all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them  they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however,  we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or  Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre documentary maker macrae defends film as providing balance to false official narrative","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present.

another of which, Hurricane Florence, caused mass evacuations on the east coast of the United States in recent days.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s road, rail, air and ferry services are likely to be affected, with longer journey times and cancellations a possibility, Met Office experts warned.\n\nRoads and bridges may close, and fallen trees are expected, with gales and heavy rain anticipated along Northern Ireland\u0027s east coast from this evening.\n\nTomorrow is forecast to start off dry and bright, becoming cloudy with rain showers and strengthening winds as the day goes on. \n\nUnsettled weather conditions are due to  on Wednesday and Thursday, the Met Office said.\n\nThe weather warning kicked in just a day after Belfast City Council held its annual Autumn Fair in the city\u0027s Botanic Gardens, where a dazzling range of acts, florists, gardeners, musicians and craftspeople entertained the crowds, marking the end of summer.\n\nWhile the grown-ups enjoyed the music and displays of flowers and specially-grown vegetables, the Autumn Fair\u0027s younger visitors were spoilt for choice with a vast array of carnival games, safari train rides, workshops, mini explorers sensory play and crazy golf, amazing magic shows, captivating street performers and autumn arts and crafts to explore.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"howlin vows to continue as labour leader","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The Labour Party is about providing solutions, not protest.”\n\nAsked of the potential for joining forces with the Greens and Social Democrats to re-enter government as a part of a coalition of the left, Mr Howlin suggested the party might currently be more effective from the opposition benches.\n\n“We obviously have a free hand in opposition,” he said, explaining that his party was not wedded to a coalition partner that does not share its view point.\n\n“Fianna Fail and Fine Gael are parties that fundamentally agree with the market solving problems, we believe in the state solving problems for ordinary people.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"aviva investors to vote against unilever hq move from london","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

London-listed firm, warned that the move will fail to benefit shareholders who will likely be forced to offload Unilever stock after its is removed from the FTSE 100.\n\nUnilever, which owns well-known brands including Marmite and Dove soap, will put plans to simply its dual headquarter structure to shareholders on October 25 and 26.\n\nIf successful, Unilever will ditch its second head office in London and run its headquarters solely out of the Netherlands.\n\nUnilever aims to complete the changes by Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\nUnilever’s decision appears to be a defensive response to recent governance challenges and consequently will not create any value for shareholders.\nDavid Cumming, Aviva Investors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cumming, chief investment officer for equities at Aviva Investors, said: “We will be voting against Unilever’s proposal to relinquish its UK domicile in favour of Rotterdam.\n\n“Unilever’s decision appears to be a defensive response to recent governance challenges and consequently will not create any value for shareholders.\n\n“Furthermore, a material number of long-standing supportive UK shareholders will become forced sellers due to the resultant removal of this high-quality company from the FT All Share and FTSE 100 indices.”\n\nUnilever announced that it planned to “simply” from two legal entities into a single one incorporated in Rotterdam in March.\n\nIt dealt a major blow to the UK Government and its efforts to uphold Britain’s status as a centre for business after Brexit.\n\nBut Unilever has insisted the move to Rotterdam has “nothing to do with Brexit”.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt also said at the time its 7,300 workers the UK and 3,100 in the Netherlands will be unaffected by the changes.\n\nUnilever, which is also behind well-known household brands such as Ben \u0026 Jerry’s ice cream and Lipton teas, employs around 169,000 people around the world.\n\nThe changes simplication will be achieved through a UK scheme of arrangement and a Dutch legal merger, which will complete over the weekend of December 22 and 23.\n\nThe new shares will begin trading in the Netherlands on December 24.\n\nHowever, Unilever’s shares are unlikely to continue trading in the FTSE 100 in the wake of the move.\n\nWithout a UK headquarters, Unilever is expected to fall short of requirements which would allow a listing on the FTSE 100, where its shares currently trade.\n\nIts shares will continue to trade on the London Stock Exchange, but will no longer be listed on a benchmark index.\n\nAs part of the rejig, Unilever will also restructure into three isions – beauty and personal care, home care, and foods and refreshment – which will each have dferent headquarters split between the UK and the Netherlands.\n\nThe beauty and personal care and home care isions will be headquartered in London, while the foods and refreshment arm will have its HQ in Rotterdam.\n\nUnilever shares were down 0.4% in morning trading.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"13 phrases from tv and film that people use all the time in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

couple have raised over £5,000 in aid of the hospital unit that saved their twins’ lives with the help of a close friend.\n\nBob and Michelle McLaughlin daughters Saorlaith and Saoirse received le-saving care at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit , where they were looked after in 2016 after they were born prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication.\n\nThe girls arrived six weeks early and suffered from ‘Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome’ in the womb, where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.\n\nThey were nursed back to health by the staff at the Neo Natal unit and their parents have held a charity walk for the past two years to raise money to say thanks.\n\nThis year family friend Michael Kelly offered to hold a fundraising event at his tattoo parlour to help boost their donation.\n\nIt soon mushroomed into a huge family fun day at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park and rock night at the Delacroix which both took place on Saturday.\n\nMr Kelly was joined by a team of tattooist from across the north who managed to ‘ink up’ 120 people with specially designed tattoos.\n\nThose who got tattooed included parents whose children had spent time in the ward and even three members of staff.\n\nMr McLaughlin got two designs himself- a purple ribbon, which is the symbol of prematurity awareness, and a set of footprints surrounded by a heart shaped stethoscope to pay tribute to the care given to his daughters at the hospital.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push

would turn up and show their support from all over the city and beyond.\n\n“A lot of people had personal reasons for being there and personal reasons behind the tattoos that they choose.\n\n“There was one woman who got a tattoo in memory of her grand child who had sadly passed away in the NNICU, so there were a lot of really emotional stories.”\n\nAwareness\n\nMr McLaughlin thanked everyone who helped make the fundraising event such a huge success.\n\n“It means the world to us that Michael decided to do this for our family and that he and all his staff and visiting tattoo artists gave up their time for free,” he added.\n\n“It is something we will never forget. It has raised £5,347.20 for the NNICU and it has raised so much awareness as well.\n\n“Thank you also to The McConomy School of Irish dance who allowed their premises to be used for the fun day and to the dancers and bands that performed during the day, to Donna Kelly and Noleen O’Hara who baked all night for the bake sale, to the bikers and bands who took part in the Delacroix and everyone who gave their time and money to make the event such a success.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"garden remembrance opened derry memory people taken lives","story":"\nA ceremony was held in Derry earlier this week for the opening of a garden of remembrance for those who have taken their own lives.\n\nPeople assembled at the Creggan Community Collective at Cromore Gardens last week to officially open the garden for those who have lost their lives to suicide.\n\nThe Creggan Men’s Group planted a weeping willow tree alongside a plaque which read: “We will be known forever by the tracks we leave.”\n\nThere was a moment of silence for those who have passed away and people gathered, many of whom have been deeply affected by suicide, took time to reflect on their own loved ones.\n\nCross-community support was shown for the event by Reverend Katie McAteer and Rev.

overturn a planning decision which would have seen the owners of a restaurant in the city centre banned from erecting a shelter at the front of the premises.\n\nThe application came before the September meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Committee seeking approval for the installation of three external retractable awnings to part of the front façade of the Custom House building at Custom House Street in Derry, pictured above.\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, a planning officer said that advice had been received from the Historic Environment Division  that the installation would have an ‘adverse affect’ on a number of listed buildings within the area, including Custom House, the Harbour Commissioners Office, Harbour Square and The Guildhall.\n\nThe meeting was told that the HED were of the opinion that the proposal would result in ‘unnecessary damage’ to the historic structure. \n\nThe officer added that while the plans before them had been amended from a previous application, the awnings would still ‘obscure the windows to a certain extent and remain inappropriate on a building of this style and character’.\n\nThe meeting head that a precedent had been set by the nearby Guildhall Taphouse bar, formerly the Monico Bar, another listed building which mow has an awning over a seated area.\n\nHowever, the Historic Environment Division said the building was ‘of a dferent style’.\n\nThe planning officer advised local councillors refuse the application on grounds that the proposal is ‘unacceptable’ as it would have an adverse effect on the character of Custom House and the setting of the surrounding listed buildings.\n\nThe meeting then heard from a representative of the applicant, Kular Fashions, who said that the contractor chosen to carry out the work are the ‘best in the UK’ and would carry out the work in a ‘delicate’ manner which would have ‘no impact on the structure itself’.\n\nHe added that the awning would bring ‘le and people’ into the space and said buildings are ‘not antiques’ and should be ‘inhabitable’ whether it is sunny or raining.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize

of buildings in the area and she didn’t want to interfere with their architectural integrity.\n\nCouncillor Dan Kelly, of Sinn Féin, said the awnings would provide shelter for street entertainment and believed that tables on the streets was part of the ‘direction of travel’ in the city. \n\nHead of Planning with council, Maura Fox, said it is a ‘balancing act’ and she was ‘very much in favour of retaining listed buildings’. \n\nSDLP councillor Tina Gardiner said she would be supportive of the awning  it was ‘tasteful’ and made reference to their widespread use on historic buildings in London. \n\nUsing the Guildhall Taphouse as an example, she said it made the space visible and attracts ‘le and vitality’.\n\nMeanwhile, Sinn Féin Cllr Patricia Logue said, the buildings may become ‘vacant and derelict’, but agreed that they should contain ‘no advertising’. \n\nHowever, the SDLP’s Gus Hastings believed awnings didn’t serve much purpose and would only encourage ‘outside smoking’ and therefore wouldn’t be supporting it.\n\nEleven councillors voted in favour of the awnings and two against, meaning the advice of planning officers was ‘overturned’.\n\nThe meeting was told that the matter would come back before the council next month.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"young film maker calls derry support john hume entry international competition","story":"\nA Media Production

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

It also provided an opportunity to maximise the natural resources of Portaferry by creating a space to access the outdoor recreational infrastructure with a particular focus on maritime activity.\n\nThe project began in 2017 when, after a seven-year search for ideas and funding, the sailing club was successful in getting permission to develop a semi-derelict building adjoining its premises.\n\nTo develop and manage the property, the club formed Portaferry Community Services Ltd.\u0026nbsp Renovation work on the Hub was finally completed in April this year.\u0026nbsp\n\nFunding came from a number of sources including Portaferry Regeneration Ltd through their Heritage Lottery\u0026rsquos Townscape Heritage Initiative, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the Rural Development Programme, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Leader, Rural Partners Ards and North Down, Ards and North Down Borough Council, The Coastal Communities Fund and Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nPrincess Anne was welcomed on Wednesday morning by Mr Leonard Lawson, Director of Portaferry Community Services Ltd, who managed the Hub project, and Mr John McAlea, commodore of Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nThanking Princess Anne, Mr Leonard paid tribute to all of the people who brought the project to a successful fruition, including the architect, contractor, consultants, ious funders and user groups, as well as the sailing club and its voluntary workforce.\n\nHe said the club had the \u0026ldquovision and courage to invest in this project and risk going ahead with such a large scheme and had trusted him to manage the project.\n\n\u0026ldquoPeople don\u0026rsquot realise that when groups within communities create these schemes they are depending on vast amounts of voluntary input in terms of time and commitment, Mr Lawson remarked.\n\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank each and everyone one of you for the support and co-operation that has made this project possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is incredible that It takes all this number of people, the thousands of emails, countless meetings, official forms, letters and telephone calls to bring this about.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

\nGlowing tributes have been paid to a youth organisation on its 125th anniversary for its help in giving young people a “sense of belonging” and building le skills.\n\n\n   \n                 \n

\u0026amp Church Girls’ Brigade  – while similar in name to the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigade – serves only the Anglican Church, which includes the Church of Ireland, as opposed to being an interdenominational Christian youth organisation like the BB and GB.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTo mark the 125th anniversary of the organisation in Ireland, 13 members of the CLCGB Staff were invited to attend the Royal Garden Party at Hillsborough Castle on September 4, when Princess Anne was present.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe Church Lads’ and Church Girls’ Brigade will mark 125 years serving the Church of Ireland this year. \n\nIn 1893, two companies were established in Dublin at Christ Church, Leeson Park, and St Peter’s. Another two, at St Mary’s, Donnybrook and St Stephen’s were added in 1894. \n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nNorthern Ireland staff officers at the Royal Garden Party at Hillsborough Castle on September 4\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nThe first company in Belfast at St Luke’s, Northumberland Street, was formed in 1895 by Curate, Rev James Archer. Soon every diocese, other than Meath, had its CLB companies and battalions were established in Armagh, Belfast, Derry, Dublin and Limerick. Girl units were also established to work alongside CLB companies. \n\nIn 1909, Derry Cathedral established a Church Girls’ Brigade, followed by All Saints, Clooney, and they competed annually for the Marchioness of Hamilton’s Shield. St Nicholas’, Cork, ran a very successful CGB company alongside its CLB for several years.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe Great War had dreadful consequences for the brigade. Companies were closed as they lost their officers and members to the war effort. When the war ended, other than St Mary’s, Limerick Cathedral Company, and St Nicholas’, Cork, CLB and CGB, the main strength of the brigade was to be found in the north, in the 1st Down, Connor and Dromore Battalion.\n\nA successful rebuilding process took place and new CLB companies were established across Northern Ireland. With the formation of a 2nd Battalion, and subsequently a 3rd Battalion, a higher formation was required and the Ulster Regiment was formed , its first Commanding Officer being Mr Samuel Waring, DCM, of Christ Church, Lisburn. \n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nThe Ballymena CLB Company, winners of the All Ireland Camp Cup in 1912, is still going today. Founded in 1897, it is the Regiment\u0027s oldest company, and last year celebrated 120 years of service\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nNew CGB companies opened in Ballymena, Ballymoney, Dobbin, Grange, Newry, Magherafelt and Seagoe and the 1st Battalion Church Girls’ Brigade was established, under the command of Mrs Margaret Twinem from Seagoe. In 1978 CLB and CGB amalgamated.\n\nIn recent years, with the decline in attendances at churches and at Sunday schools, the brigade has experienced challenging times, losing strength in urban areas, particularly in Belfast. However, in the last five years the brigade has worked hard, under its Commanding Officer, Melvyn Lockhart, and Development Officer, Victoria Jackson, to make progress. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nCompanies have been enrolled or re-enrolled at Aghalee, Dromore , Drogheda, Dunmurry, Killinchy, Lambeg, Christ Church, Lisburn, and St Michael’s, Belfast, and there is interest being shown in other parishes. Approximately 400 members have been added to brigade’s strength.\n\nIn light of the milestone CLCGB members past and present shared their memories of the youth organisation which was set up by Walter M Gee in 1891 and first established in Ireland in 1893.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRev James Archer, while curate at St Luke\u0027s, Northumberland Street, Belfast, started the first Ulster company in 1895, and is seen as the founder of what we know today as the Ulster Regiment\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaul Crowe attended CLCGB at Christ Church, Lisburn and is now managing director of Todd Architects – the lead architect on Belfast’s iconic Titanic Centre.\n\nHe said: “I have made long lasting friendships both from within the company and with people from other companies. It has given me confidence to deal with people, particularly when it came to taking on a leadership role. \n\n“It also gave me a set of values which I feel has helped me with making right and wrong decisions.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJames Perry, who received an MBE last year for his services to the community in Ballymena, was High Sherf for Co Antrim during 2016, and is presently Clerk to the Lieutenancy of Co Antrim. \n\nHe said: “I was in the Church Lads’ Brigade in Ballymena for about 10 years, going through the YBC , JTC  and Senior Corps. \n\n“As an only child I appreciated the company of the other lads and it gave me a sense of belonging. \n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nIn 1938 Armagh and Seagoe Companies formed a Guard of Honour for Archbishop Godfrey Day at his enthronement in Armagh Cathedral as the new Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“I remember being a little bit heavy and not particularly good at getting over the vaulting box but that the officers sought ways around this to build my self-confidence. \n\n“I found the discipline and guidance from them was helpful throughout my le. I saw my officers as role models as I later became a bell-ringer and a lay reader.”\n\nDiane Roney Gould of Seagoe Church Girls’ Brigade in Portadown recalled: “Ulster Regiment trips to the CLCGB national competitions in England are something that I reminisce about often. \n\n“All CLCGB companies from Ulster that were taking part would gather at the docks, excited to meet up with friends you had made on previous trips. \n\n“My partner in crime on these trips was Ann Darcy from Portrush Company. \n\n“When we arrived in Stranraer or Cairnryan, we were flat out to get the front seat behind the driver of our coach – dear help anyone who got there before Ann. \n\n“Then we would sing the whole way to Penrith or wherever our stopover was. \n\n“Early next morning we were on our way again to the venue. Our singing would start again – much to the disappointment of some. Sometimes we sang for two to three hours solid. Our signature tune was Crazy. \n\n“I am glad to say that Ann and I are still friends all these years later.”\n\nFormer CLB member Charles Jackson, who is now living in Mauritius, said: “There were a few dficult times growing up through the teenage years. \n\n“Looking back, I can see that Friday nights at CLB, around friends and trusted leaders, was a much-needed oasis and escape, where I knew I could count on fellowship, fairness and camaraderie. I have never really said ‘thanks’ for all that hard work from the leaders over the years, but it was indeed priceless for me.”\n\nAdrian Magowan, a member of the organisation in Carnmoney, has fond memories of the summer of 1980: “I remember ‘Tom Hark’ by The Piranhas was in the top 10 and was being played everywhere you went.\n\n“I remember it was hot, but most of all I remember staying in a marquee in the grounds of Windsor Great Park. \n\n“I was all of 12 years old and it was a great adventure – the boat and train and staying in the shadow of Windsor Castle. \n\n“We were there for a Royal Review. The Queen was to inspect the lads and girls and we were representing the Ulster Regiment, with a good contingent from our company in Carnmoney.\n\n“We formed up looking smart in our black blazers, brass buckles and shoes polished and gleaming. \n\n“We waited in the rising July heat for Her Majesty to come and she did. Standing in the back of a jeep, waving like only she can. \n\n“I remember with great pride standing to attention with the rest of the lads and girls. I think we did our founder, Walter Gee, proud.”\n\nJohnny Conn, CLCGB Staff Officer, said: “I have a memory of a summer camp where I ended up in hospital with a twisted knee after slipping on the wet grass after we had a water fight in the local park.\n\n“Another time I remember one of our lady leaders standing up in a boat and hanging on to the edge of a pier, only for the boat to move away from the pier whereupon she fell into the water. \n\n“I wished I had a video camera that day.”\n\nA number of CLB men were awarded medals for their service during WWI.\n\nOne of them – Robert Hamilton, a member of the Derry Cathedral CLB Company, was 19 when the war began. He joined the 10th Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and rose from the rank of Private to Company Sergeant Major and was one of a small number of men to have been awarded both the Military Medal and Distinguished Conduct Medal. \n\nLance Sergeant Hamilton was awarded the Military Medal for his actions on the July 1, 1916 during the Battle of the Somme. After his Platoon Officer had been killed he rallied the men around him and thwarted a German counter-attack. \n\nIn 1918, Company Sergeant Major Hamilton was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal when during an attack he captured an enemy machine gun and three of its crew single-handedly. \n\nNews of the award appeared in the London Gazette, on March 28, 1918, five days after his death.\n\nOther CLB men awarded the DCM included Company Sergeant Major Samuel Waring of Christ Church, Lisburn and Sergeant Major Harry Hamilton and Corporal George Bothwell, both Holy Trinity, Portrush.\n\nCLCGB’s anniversary will be marked by a parade and service of thanksgiving in St Patrick’s Cathedral, Armagh, on Sunday, September 30 at 3.30pm.\n\nSpecial Guests will include Mrs Jill Armstrong, Deputy Lieutenant of County Armagh and Councillor Julie Flaherty, Lord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon. \n\nFormer members of the CLB and CGB are invited to attend.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nA shooting team from St Barnabas\u0027s Church, Duncairn Gardens, Belfast, 1912.
