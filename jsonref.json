Releases of restrictions, increased numbers of imports due to people travelling overseas, and evidence of poor adherence in some cases to such restrictions that remain, all have the potential to contribute to increased transmission. \u0027This trend also reflects patterns seen in other European countries which released restrictions earlier and therefore saw a case resurgence earlier. \u0027Whether or not this represents the beginning of a second wave of a national epidemic will depend on the ability of the test and trace system to respond effectively by stamping out as many local outbreaks as possible, quickly.\u0027  One saving grace even if the numbers of cases are rising is that the death toll does not seem to be picking up pace, which experts say is because cases may now be more common among younger people who are less affected.Dr Simon Clarke, professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, added: \u0027It should be remembered that we have not yet seen corresponding increases in hospital admissions, let alone deaths and it seems likely that we’d need to see sustained increases in the daily numbers of fresh diagnoses and hospital admissions before the authorities move towards any significant tightening of restrictions on our lives.\u0027People need to remain conscious of the risks of infection and get tested if they have any symptoms.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Passenger hauled flight no symptoms received text seconds off","story":"Share this articleRyanair coronavirus scare: What really happened when passenger was dragged off jet - Mirror OnlineCovid passenger on Ryanair flight \u0027had no symptoms\u0027 \u0026amp plane was about to TAKE-OFF when \u0027he received positive test text\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markles mother starts new job teacher showing students make hippy jewellery","story":"Share this article \u0027Are we about to let out one of Yorkshire\u0027s best kept secrets?\u0027 they teasingly inquire on social media, adding that Sutton, where BBC drama Gentleman Jack was filmed, boasts \u0027stunning views\u0027 — and its own caravan site.

And 59 per cent said they agreed with Boris Johnson\u0027s criticism of the BBC for \u0027cringing with embarrassment over our history\u0027.The two planned new services are both expected to be more \u0027news-talk\u0027 shows than the traditional rolling news services that are provided by BBC News and Sky News. One of the companies, GB News, which has already secured an Ofcom licence, is backed by investors from the US and the UK. It has been in talks with American media giant Discovery.It is understood that GB News has been in discussions with Mr Neil about joining up, with sources suggesting it would be similar to a TV version of the LBC radio station.According to an insider it will aim to sit in the centre of the political spectrum but be less Left-wing and less woke than the BBC. The insider said: \u0027Just by taking a centrist line it will seem more to the Right because the others are so much to the Left.\u0027 Sources say News UK, the publisher of The Sun and The Times, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, has also been developing plans to launch a news channel. Discussion are at an advanced level.Earlier this year David Rhodes, former president of CBS News in the US, was brought in to News UK. It is understood he joined to launch a news channel.There are said to be high-level discussions about what form the service will take. Mr Rhodes also worked as a senior executive at Fox News, which is on the Right of American politics and is famous for its strident take on the news. "},{"url":null,"title":"Bravery medal hero British Army dog took Al Qaeda sniper","story":"Share this article He had already conducted 16 operations over a five-month period when he was injured.Kuno required several operations before he could be flown home on an RAF plane for reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation, receiving in-flight care from a Royal Army Veterinary Corps team.Back in the UK he was transferred to the Defence Animal Training Regiment in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, where he underwent further extensive surgery.The surgery was overseen by Dick White, one of the world\u0027s leading specialists in canine surgery and special professor of small animal surgery at the University of Nottingham.Kuno then embarked upon a lengthy programme of rehabilitation to restore function to his nerves and muscles – just as any other injured service personnel would.

Does jogging wreck your knees? … An evolutionary biologist provides entertainment and helpful tipsMark Twain once said that he got all the exercise he needed acting as a pallbearer at the funerals of his friends who exercised regularly. Similarly, Donald Trump reportedly thinks the human body is like a battery with a limited store of energy, and so chooses not to use up any of it on exercise. This may be the only thing the two men have in common.Suspicion of exercise, though, is entirely natural, as the evolutionary biologist Daniel Lieberman points out in this entertaining and informative book. When interviewed, modern hunter-gatherer peoples are mystified as to why westerners should be obsessed with running long distances and lifting heavy weights when they don’t have to.The difference, of course, is that we don’t automatically get enough physical activity in an ordinary day – but learning from modern hunter-gatherers, along with facts about the evolution of the human skeleton, can give us some clues as to how to do so in a healthier and perhaps even fun way. Lieberman himself is an expert in the evolution of running, for example, and his research helped inspire the barefoot-running movement based on solid evidence that striking the ground with the ball of the foot (rather than the heel, as highly cushioned shoes encourage) is more ergonomically efficient and leads to fewer injuries.It’s not the case, though, that even if you run “normally”, you’ll eventually wreck your knees. That is one of the many “myths” about exercise that Lieberman helpfully punctures by carefully assessing all the evidence from studies. (Inactive older people are much more likely to develop osteoarthritis of the joints than lifelong exercisers.)Nor is it true that simply walking would be insufficient exercise: it’s just that you need to do much more of it than most people (at least five hours’ brisk walking a week). You often hear these days that exercise doesn’t help people to lose weight. It turns out, argues Lieberman, that isn’t true either, and for the same reason: most people trying don’t do enough of it.The book is full of helpful tips – you’ll build muscle faster by extending muscles under load rather than contracting them the kind of chair you sit on doesn’t matter as long as you strengthen your back muscles and move regularly – conveyed in a humorous and sympathetic style. The notion of exercise, Lieberman keeps repeating, is modern, weird and unpleasant, so the best way to do more is to find something you actually enjoy, and perhaps build in some social motivation by doing it with other people.

As well as red flags about the specific businesses in question, they challenge Boohoo’s claim that issues exposed over the summer were simply “the actions of a few”. There is no suggestion that Boohoo, which has its own oversight process, had access to the reports.Asked about the findings, eight of the firms denied the claims in whole or in part, in some cases saying that they reflected circumstances at a particular moment that have since changed.Another 10 did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Here is a summary of the concerns raised at some of the companies – and their responses:Onyx, which has about 50 employees, was accused in one recent audit of having inaccurate hours recorded for workers. The report also alleged that in some cases furlough money was not paid to workers and that holiday pay was not paid.The company, which confirmed that it supplies Boohoo, said it had not seen the reports. It noted that it had installed a biometric clocking system a month ago and that workers were paid every four weeks and provided with payslips.It said holiday and furlough entitlements were paid in full and it “vehemently denied” the claim that managers and workers had said full-time workers were recorded as working part-time. “We have never received a complaint from them and their feedback for us has been positive, as far as we are aware.” CTG, which identified Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing as its key customers, was accused in a 2018 audit of failing to maintain working-hours records, making it impossible to verify payment of the minimum wage. The audit found a worker’s passport had expired, and that the worker did not have the right to work in the UK.CTG said the passport issue was the result of an oversight and led to the worker’s suspension until the passport was reinstated, noting that the company had since reformed its processes over the issue. It added: “Minimum wage is always paid … the company operates under the strictest ethical and industrial codes of best practice.” It said the welfare of its employees was paramount.The company, which mainly produced leisurewear, faced concerns in a 2018 audit report that timesheets were not signed by workers and minimum-wage payments could not be verified. It later went into liquidation, owing more than £600,000 to HM Revenue and Customs, even as it paid almost all its other creditors, leading to its director, Mahomed Hanif Musa Patel, being struck off as a director, HMRC records show. He is still legally allowed to own a business and now part-owns a different firm not covered by the audit, Dariyai Products Ltd, which operates from the same premises producing women’s outerwear. Patel did not respond to the ’s requests for comment last week. The company, which sits in the heart of Leicester’s garment district, was accused in a 2017 report of failing to keep proper records of working hours, making it impossible to verify the payment of minimum wages. And the report found that one worker was missing their right-to-work documentation while others had not been verified by the factory. At the time, the company produced solely for Boohoo. There was no answer when the  visited the premises recently, and no response to emails, while a member of staff who picked up the phone ended the call when asked for comment. The company was named this week in a Health and Safety Executive improvement notice, which it complied with, for failing to provide adequate washing facilities in toilets during the coronavirus crisis.On 8 July, we announced an independent review of our UK supply chain in Leicester. This two-part approach\u0026nbspsaw us invest heavily in significant extra compliance and auditing resource to forensically investigate the allegations that had been made about mistreatment of people employed by garment manufacturers in the area. We also appointed senior barrister Alison Levitt QC to lead a comprehensive and fully independent review of our Leicester supply chain, which has included a public call for evidence.\u0026nbspThe documentation that has been seen by the  appears to be a selection of commentary from a limited number of the third-party audits that have been completed. Whilst we are deeply concerned by these findings, until these processes are concluded, we have had sight of all the facts and received Ms Levitt’s findings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe group is committed to delivering the highest standards of ethics, compliance and transparency, and we have committed to sharing an update on the findings of Ms Levitt’s review, our response, and the actions that we will take to address any failings at the end of September.\u0026nbspWe will continue to offer our full support to raise standards where appropriate for the benefit of those employed in our supply chain, but will not hesitate to take more severe action when necessary. We can confirm that due to the nature of the non-compliance that we have found in a small number of manufacturers during this process we have immediately suspended trading with them whilst they take the appropriate action to resolve the issues identified within the timeline we have set. This includes some of the manufacturers identified by the , as our own investigations have highlighted similar issues.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe feel that it is important to give owners the opportunity to show demonstrable, measurable and significant improvement to protect the jobs of those employed, but if we are left in any doubt about an owner’s true commitment to drive change in the timeframe that we have set out we will have no choice but to terminate trading with them.\u0026nbspWe recognise that walking away from every factory where an issue is found would have a catastrophic impact on the livelihoods of those employed in the sector. Instead, we are working closely with a number of organisations, including the GLAA and Slave Free Alliance, sharing our findings with them to support the important work that they do in ensuring that the rights of workers are protected and that everyone is treated fairly and paid appropriately.A recent audit of the company said records of working hours were inaccurate, with worker interviews claiming that staff paid for part-time hours were in fact working for longer, and therefore being paid below the minimum wage. It also said Gal Fashion was subcontracting for a Boohoo supplier at a price estimated to be below what would be realistic if staff were paid the minimum wage.Jigar Patel, who has run the business since it was founded in 2018, said: “Everyone is paid properly, Boohoo checked and everything is fine” when approached by the . In a subsequent email the company said there were “some mix-ups due to human error” with its manual recording system in November 2019 and that the firm had recently installed a clocking-in system. Describing the allegations as outdated, they added: “There were no issues regarding minimum wage or concerns about employees getting paid. In 2018, the company had a national minimum wage audit carried out from HMRC and this was all fine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed2fe976d253334925cd932a53bc7309c888941f/0_219_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6867c4c2ace657c2daac0941f22696b1","title":"revealed auditors raised minimum wage red flags at boohoo factories","story":"Exclusive: Third-party reports set out allegations at 18 Leicester suppliers The fast-fashion retailer Boohoo has been selling clothes made by at least 18 factories in Leicester that audits say have failed to prove they pay the minimum wage to workers, a  investigation has found.Third-party audit reports produced over the past four years make claims of “critical” issues over record-keeping and working hours at the time they were written, suggesting that in parts of the supply chain workers may be paid as little as £3-£4 an hour.Disclosed alongside new whistleblower claims about Boohoo’s supply chain, the confidential reports provide a snapshot of alleged issues in a factory at a specific time. They pose a new challenge to the brand’s insistence that issues reported in July were simply evidence of “the actions of a few” and stood in contrast to “the excellent work of many of our suppliers in the area”.Claudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, where many of the factories are based, said the allegations suggested “an unforgivable breakdown of our basic social contract” and called on Boohoo to urgently release a full list of its suppliers in the city.Boohoo said the documentation seen by the  “appears to be a selection of commentary from a limited number of the third-party audits that have been completed”. But it added that its own investigations “have highlighted similar issues” in some of the manufacturers identified by the  and that it had suspended trading with them until its concerns were resolved.Claims in the documents, which were described by one expert as “a smoking gun” on Boohoo and other brands’ oversight of minimum wage issues, detail allegations of:The reports, which date from 2017 to just a few months ago, came alongside whistleblower claims of other violations in Leicester’s factories. Industry sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they had seen dozens more that raised similar concerns at other Boohoo suppliers.There is no suggestion that Boohoo had access to the reports, which were circulated to some factory managers and other brands. The company, which has been accused in the past of turning a blind eye to issues in its supply chain, has its own oversight process for factories in Leicester.On its own investigations, Boohoo said: “Due to the nature of the non-compliance that we have found in a small number of manufacturers … we have immediately suspended orders with a number of suppliers whilst they take the appropriate action to resolve the issues identified. This includes some of the manufacturers identified by the .”It added that it was “deeply concerned by these findings” but said that until its own investigations and an independent QC-led review were complete “it would be inappropriate for us to comment further”. The brand did not clarify which of the factories it had suspended.Eight of the 18 companies denied some or all of the claims set out in the audits, with some calling them historical or saying they did not represent typical standards. The other 10 did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Audit reports are a central part of how fashion brands assess working practices in factories before deciding whether to place orders. But while they may be circulated within the industry, until now the reports have not been released publicly, even when they raise concerns over possible minimum-wage violations.“We have long known these reports exist, but brands never release them,” said Nik Hammer, an associate professor in employment studies at the University of Leicester and author of a 2015 report on the city’s textiles industry.The reports came alongside separate claims from one worker at Pro Fashion Limited, a subcontractor making clothes for Boohoo and its sister brands PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal. The worker showed the  a recent “official” payslip. It showed them earning the £8.72 legal minimum wage. Separately, the worker had what they described as a “shadow” payslip which was handwritten and they said showed many hours more had been worked. That suggested the real rate was just £6 an hour.Concerns over the company’s supply chain have been raised repeatedly over the years by campaign groups, the media and MPs, including the Conservative Andrew Bridgen in a speech to parliament earlier this year. But the brand and the government have until recently largely ignored calls for reform.The scrutiny intensified again this summer after the  revealed claims that Leicester textile firms had breached lockdown measures, and the Sunday Times reported that one Boohoo supplier had offered an undercover reporter £3.50 an hour.The Manchester-based brand had £1.5bn wiped off its share price in two days in July amid growing investor concern over practices within its supply chain. When the lockdown claims first emerged, Boohoo said they were inaccurate and that it “categorically does not tolerate any incidence of non-compliance … with our strict code of conduct”.With investors deserting the firm, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, demanding the company do more to protect workers in its supply chain, it announced plans to set up a “model factory” in Leicester where workers would be treated fairly, and set up an independent review. It also said it would increase an inspection programme led by the third-party auditor Verisio.But critics say the whistleblower accounts and reports seen by the  provide a worrying snapshot of the problems within the industry, particularly over alleged minimum-wage violations. At Onyx Fashion, a Boohoo supplier, one audit claimed managers admitted full-time workers were being falsely recorded as working part-time hours – an allegation the company “vehemently denied”.A 2018 report on Ezili Dariyai, which mainly produced leisurewear, said timesheets were not signed by workers and minimum-wage payments could not be verified. The company then went into liquidation, owing more than £600,000 to HM Revenue and Customs, causing Mahomed Hanif Musa Patel to be struck off as a director. He did not respond to requests for comment.Another firm, Bux Clothing, was accused in a 2017 audit of failing to keep proper records of working hours, making it impossible to verify the payment of minimum wage. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment.On 8 July, we announced an independent review of our UK supply chain in Leicester. This two-part approach\u0026nbspsaw us invest heavily in significant extra compliance and auditing resource to forensically investigate the allegations that had been made about mistreatment of people employed by garment manufacturers in the area. We also appointed senior barrister Alison Levitt QC to lead a comprehensive and fully independent review of our Leicester supply chain, which has included a public call for evidence.\u0026nbspThe documentation that has been seen by the  appears to be a selection of commentary from a limited number of the third-party audits that have been completed. Whilst we are deeply concerned by these findings, until these processes are concluded, we have had sight of all the facts and received Ms Levitt’s findings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe group is committed to delivering the highest standards of ethics, compliance and transparency, and we have committed to sharing an update on the findings of Ms Levitt’s review, our response, and the actions that we will take to address any failings at the end of September.\u0026nbspWe will continue to offer our full support to raise standards where appropriate for the benefit of those employed in our supply chain, but will not hesitate to take more severe action when necessary. We can confirm that due to the nature of the non-compliance that we have found in a small number of manufacturers during this process we have immediately suspended trading with them whilst they take the appropriate action to resolve the issues identified within the timeline we have set. This includes some of the manufacturers identified by the , as our own investigations have highlighted similar issues.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe feel that it is important to give owners the opportunity to show demonstrable, measurable and significant improvement to protect the jobs of those employed, but if we are left in any doubt about an owner’s true commitment to drive change in the timeframe that we have set out we will have no choice but to terminate trading with them.\u0026nbspWe recognise that walking away from every factory where an issue is found would have a catastrophic impact on the livelihoods of those employed in the sector. Instead, we are working closely with a number of organisations, including the GLAA and Slave Free Alliance, sharing our findings with them to support the important work that they do in ensuring that the rights of workers are protected and that everyone is treated fairly and paid appropriately.Bux Clothing is one of five textile firms in Leicester to separately be issued with improvement notices by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) over hygiene and social distancing measures since the city’s second lockdown, alongside I Design Leicester, Clothing Pallet, VR Mode Limited and Smart Garments. All five complied with the notices.As well as Bux, the  has established through worker interviews that Smart Garments is also a Boohoo supplier.Smart Garments did not dispute the HSE’s findings that it “failed to put reasonably practicable control measures in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19” but said the body was “satisfied with our risk assessment and how we managed the factory in the current Covid environment”. Boohoo did not comment on the improvement notices.Dominique Muller, whose report on Leicester factories in lockdown for the campaign group Labour Behind the Label prompted the recent Boohoo storm, claimed the range of the audits showed that “the idea that this could go on without Boohoo’s knowledge or tacit acceptance, it’s a complete fallacy. They hold the power in Leicester, and it’s disingenuous to pretend anything else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64db94351c41669ced77ba1960099443015b078d/0_119_3736_2242/master/3736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4baa4ef2c1ca60c2bdfb71a0d9bb42dd","title":"waitrose and deliveroo to take on m and s and ocado online groceries","story":"Tuesday marks new front in fight for online groceries market as Ocado and Waitrose part waysWaitrose is to test fast-track grocery deliveries with the takeaway courier firm Deliveroo as it prepares to do battle with its rival Marks \u0026amp Spencer, which will finally begin selling groceries online next week.After almost two decades together, the online grocery specialist Ocado has ditched Waitrose and will switch to selling M\u0026ampS food from Tuesday, kicking off a fight between the two grocers for the online upper-midmarket.In a last minute move, Waitrose has unveiled a 12-week trial with Deliveroo, through which more than 500 of the supermarket’s products could be delivered within 30 minutes of five stores. The service will be available from stores including Bristol, Cambridge and Notting Hill, west London, and adds to Waitrose’s two-hour Rapid service, which is now operating from 29 stores and has 23,000 customers.James Bailey, the executive director of Waitrose, said: “This gives us another opportunity to give our customers a taste of what the future of convenience shopping could look like for us.”Slick delivery service from robot-run distribution centresDelivery fee:\u0026nbspup to £6.99 depending on timingNumber of products: 50,000, including 6,000 M\u0026ampS items from TuesdayFastest delivery:\u0026nbspless than 30 minutes if you live near the Zoom facility in Chiswick, west LondonStaff-owned service run from mix of stores and warehousesNumber of products:\u0026nbspup to 27,000, about half of which are own-labelSubstitutions: average two per order, with option of refund or biggerbetter productFastest delivery:\u0026nbspless than two hours via Rapid service, which operates from 29 stores. Also less than 30 minutes via Deliveroo from five stores from SeptemberWhile Waitrose is revving mopeds and delivery bikes, Ocado will close two of its three giant robot-run warehouses on bank holiday Monday so it can ship out remaining Waitrose products to food banks and the food redistributor Company Shop. At the same time, thousands of fresh M\u0026ampS products will be trucked in to join the tins, packets and other less fragile and perishable goods that have been gradually filling Ocado’s warehouses over the last three weeks.Only those Ocado shoppers close to the group’s warehouse in Erith, south-east London, will be able to receive one of the last Ocado deliveries containing Waitrose products on Monday.Melanie Smith, the head of Ocado’s retail arm, will be present at one of group’s first deliveries containing M\u0026ampS food products on Tuesday at about 6am – potentially in a van decked out in the livery of M\u0026ampS Percy Pig sweets that was spotted on a motorway covered in black plastic before the launch.Smith said she felt relaxed about the switch from Waitrose to M\u0026ampS after 18 months of preparations, adding that there had been a “strong level of forward demand” for the move. Despite the gradual unwinding of coronavirus lockdown measures and return to work for many, Ocado’s delivery slots are still selling out every day with all of Tuesday’s snapped up earlier this week.Bailey, who only joined Waitrose in May, said he was “feeling optimistic” especially as the switch to online shopping during the pandemic had already helped Waitrose replace those Ocado sales.Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, has gained more than 100,000 extra online orders a week – or about 250,000 customers – since lockdown began. Online sales are already at an annualised rate of £1bn, the group’s target for the end of the year. But the retailer is clearly ambitious for more with two last-minute changes this week.First Waitrose cut its minimum order from £60 to £40, putting it on a par with Ocado. Then it announced the Deliveroo trial.Bailey said the biggest change would be a more direct relationship with its shoppers. While Waitrose supplied 4,000 products to Ocado, making up about a quarter of the latter’s grocery sales, it had no contact with them.“Now we’ll be the No 1 connection with customers online and can communicate with them about the brands we sell, our food provenance and all the things that make Waitrose special and different,” Bailey said.Waitrose’s battle is not only with Ocado and M\u0026ampS but also Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda and Amazon, all of whom are investing heavily in expanding online. Food box firms, such as Riverford, and meal kit services have also experienced massive growth while restaurants and cafes have been closed.Despite the gradual return to offices and schools, Smith said she did not expect Ocado shoppers to head back to stores. “The hurdle for us is the move to shopping online. Once customers start then they tend to stick online. Competitors have done us a great service switching a lot of people to shop online,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6d482bca3fc535cbf4ce96c4ef6d6b9684ec31/0_68_953_572/master/953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0be043bb6e75a07094a11b994598a2f9","title":"pebble pods and bubble domes six amazing places to wake up in northern ireland","story":"From quirky glampsites to boutique hotels with amazing views, discover the most enticing places to stay in Northern IrelandPebble Pods, Strangford, County DownA relatively new entry to the Northern Ireland glamping scene, but one of the most remarkable, this private location on the shores of Strangford Lough takes pod camping to a new level – and with only three two-person pods, you’ll never find it overcrowded.The glass-and-timber Pebble Pods resemble Hobbit holes, and have a host of amenities, but let’s focus on the most important: a private hot tub, thermal sauna, firepit and barbecue area, providing for year-round luxuriating by the cool waters of one of NI’s most gorgeous loughs.If you’re an active person, there are free bikes and even kayaks to help you explore the area. If you’re feeling more laid back, you can just hit the tub and let the world scurry on by.Lough Erne Resort, County FermanaghIf you’re after absolute luxury, why not go the whole hog? The sprawling, castellated Lough Erne Resort, housed on its own 243-hectare (600-acre) peninsula between the reedy shores of Lower Lough Erne and Castle Hume Lough, just outside Enniskillen, really is the last word in refinement.Starting your day with a choice between the resort’s two world-class golf courses sounds like our kind of dilemma: the Faldo course has been represented globally by local son Rory McIlroy, who holds the course record.For those who don’t have the golf bug, take heart: with an incredible Thai spa, world-class restaurants and access to the 40-mile-long splendour of Lough Erne, you’ll be fine.If it’s good enough to host the not-unpicky G8 summit (as it did in 2013), Lough Erne Resort is sure to satisfy your own exacting standards …And those who are after quality local food won’t need to look further than the resort’s Catalina restaurant, where guests can dine in luxury after a long day of exploring.Larchfield Estate, Lisburn, County AntrimIt’s fair to say Myrtle has been around for a while, seen a few tight squeezes, and is always ready with a warm welcome for her guests. Don’t worry, she’s not an over-friendly local – Myrtle is a lovingly-restored 1952 Saurer Swiss Army truck that now serves as one of Northern Ireland’s most inspiring glamping options at the gorgeous Larchfield Estate.The accommodation is suitably cosy and stylish, equipped with a log-burning stove, sun deck and a sauna housed in its own wooden pod with bucolic views of the surrounding greenery. Rise and shine after a night with Myrtle and set off to explore the 243-hectare (600-acre) estate. Mission accomplished.Killeavy Castle Estate, County ArmaghA gothic flight of fantasy built in 1836, Killeavy Castle is both grand and cosy: it features imposing medieval-style doors and turrets, yet the restored pile makes room for just four luxurious bedrooms within its castellated walls. Wake to the view from any of its 52 windows and you’ll feel like landed gentry.Elsewhere on the estate, the original mill, gatehouse and coach house have all been converted into stylish accommodation. There’s also a high-end spa, all on 142 hectares (350 acres) in the shadow of Slieve Gullion, the tallest mountain in County Armagh.Famed for its locally sourced food, Killeavy Castle Estate provides everything from sublime seven-course tasting menus to a famously good fry-up for breakfast.That’s your morning plans sorted.Palace Street Apartments, Derry-LondonderryPass through the famed city walls at the ornate Bishop’s Gate, then hang a sneaky left, and you’ll find yourself in a barely car-width street lined on one side by the kind of Victorian red brick you’d expect to see in an adaptation of Dickens.It’s also the very fitting home of the Palace Street Apartments, a lovingly restored, three-unit, self-catering gem. Step outside in the morning and you’ll find all of Derry-Londonderry at your feet. Within the confines of the old walled city, you’re only a stroll away from the historic Guildhall (as well-known for its political history as for its appearance in Derry Girls), St Columba’s Cathedral, where the original keys of the city are held, and the Diamond war memorial.That said, dark wood, oiled leather, antique furniture and deep beds come as standard in each apartment, making going outside an optional extra.Finn Lough, County FermanaghA lot has been written about the bubble domes at the eco-conscious Finn Lough resort in Fermanagh, but nothing can prepare you for the experience of waking snug and cosy in a luxury bed, and opening your eyes to see the dawn sky straight above you.These transparent domes offer uninterrupted views of the surrounding nature alongside high-end creature comforts: four-poster beds, ensuite bathrooms, and coffee machines to ease you into the morning the right way.Once you’ve recovered from the majesty of the morning there are woodland trails to explore, on foot or cycle, and a lake to linger by. There’s also a top-tier spa for those who aim simply to “sleep well, be pampered” – and who can blame them, when your bed is this spectacular?Come on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345c28211f4ca1ea57842a60109e9d76c3d87992/0_116_6242_3745/master/6242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b59877834e5319eb717de6309ac0365b","title":"surf cycle or hike go wild on northern irelands adventure coast","story":"Where can you hike along a world-heritage coastline, ride an Atlantic wave, then cycle around a puffin colony, all within a few miles of each other? The answer is along Northern Ireland’s Causeway CoastWhether you like to explore on foot, by bike or by water, Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coast could be the most scenic part of the UK you’ve never visited. Yet its natural attractions and ersity of landscapes make it perfect for anyone with an adventurous heart.Here we pick a few of Northern Ireland’s outdoor highlights, though the full range of opportunities extend far beyond what’s mentioned here. The best advice? Book a week and discover the possibilities for yourself.Explore by footAt the tip of Northern Ireland lies its most famous attraction – the Unesco world heritage site of the Giant’s Causeway. And there’s no better way to reach it than on foot, by following an eight-mile section of the Causeway Coast Way. Begin at picturesque Ballintoy Harbour, which Game of Thrones fans will recognise as a setting for the Iron Islands. Then head west along the signed coast path, passing sandy beaches, rock arches and a ruined clifftop castle before finishing at the Giant’s Causeway. The 40,000 interlocking basalt columns provide a fitting finale to one of the best walks in Northern Ireland.For something completely different, head to nearby Glenariff Forest Park. Set within the celebrated Glens of Antrim, the scenery here transports you to another world. Expect numerous waterfalls, wooden walkways deep within river gorges, and long-distance views along chiselled glacial escarpments. Signed hiking circuits of different lengths mean there’s a route for walkers of all abilities.Explore by bikeIf two wheels are your thing, Rathlin Island offers an outing that will remain etched in your memory for years to come. Lying six miles off the coast, the trip begins with a ferry ride from Ballycastle marina. You’ll need to bring your own bike due to Covid-19 restrictions, but the island can be explored in a few hours. The highlight is the eight-mile return trip to its western tip. Here the land ends in sheer cliffs that are home to both a lighthouse and Northern Ireland’s largest breeding seabird colony. There’s no better way to break your ride than descending to the RSPB viewing platform and, if you’re here at the right time of year – between April and August – watching the antics of hundreds of thousands of nesting birds. Regardless of when you visit, the views remain breathtaking all year round, and the sensual assault of sound and smell makes the trip back to the harbour feel positively peaceful.For a longer journey, back on the mainland try the signed cycle route between the Giant’s Causeway and Benone. This 22-mile trip can be completed in either direction, and follows a mixture of public roads and traffic-free paths. The ride takes you through the coastal towns of Portrush, Portstewart and Castlerock, with numerous opportunities to explore sandy beaches or stop for refreshments along the way.Explore by waterAnother great option is to leave the land altogether, and explore the unique coastline from the sea. This is a shore littered with caves, arches, tunnels and cliffs, and the only way to appreciate them fully is from the water.Sea kayaking is a great option, with several local companies providing all the equipment and guidance you need to begin weaving silently between the headlands. Choose from a half-day or full-day excursion, with incredible coastal scenery interspersed by a snack or lunch in some tucked-away cove along the way.If you’d prefer to embrace the waves then there’s the chance to try surfing instead – the neighbouring towns of Portrush and Portstewart are the twin meccas for local surfers. Hire a wetsuit and surfboard from the back of the beach, book into a lesson, then hit the waves. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, you’re guaranteed a great time, with watery thrills and spills all part of the fun.Novices and experts are also welcomed by the local sailing centres. Take a lesson or join a skippered yacht for a longer adventure, spending anything from an hour to a whole weekend on the water. With the emphasis on guests doing as much of the sailing as possible, it won’t be long before you know your jib from your gybe.Something differentOf course the activities mentioned here just scrape the surface of what’s available, and with a little imagination almost anything is possible. How about a catch-and-sea boat trip, where you start by going sea fishing, then return to watch a professional chef prepare your bounty, garnished by other local delicacies?Or a horse ride, featuring a gentle hack through the glens or an adrenaline-filled canter across the beach? Organised scuba ing, coasteering it’s all here, with countless options to suit all ages and abilities.So what’s keeping you away? The Causeway Coast is a goldmine of activities and opportunities, its charms are just waiting to be discovered.Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the mini-bus tour, bird sanctuary and bike hire are not currently available, for more information visit: rathlincommunity.orghomeCome on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3ab46739d6c3a877a73178f0a2cde30e0cdcf95/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4031e6814e4ae71c9667de0f5787b2da","title":"i started lockdown with the focus of sarah connor in terminator now im drinking more than ever","story":"Life is still incredibly difficult out there, and the boon about working from home is that the sun is always over the yard armLately, my refrigerator always contains an ice-cold bottle of vodka and at least two bottles of rosé. It is still summer, after all. Summer in semi-lockdown that stage where the doors are open and we’re ostensibly free to leave, but outdoors is strange, so it’s easier to have a large glass of something nice on the sofa. There are no QR codes to scan, and no queuing for the bar in the same stiff manner with which one might line up to collect a hire car. Who knew that one day I’d crave the scrum and jostle of getting in a round in a heaving pub? Or miss the quaint Britishness of ferrying half-spilt drinks through a Friday night bunfight with the martyred groan of “It’s hell at that bar”?Instead, millions of us are staying safely at home. We’re mixing our own cocktails and protecting our lungs, but I’m not so sure we’re as concerned about our livers. I began lockdown in March behaving like Sarah Connor in The Terminator: doing squats, lifting weights, drinking gallons of water, determined to live out the apocalypse. But soon the new world needed numbing and a lovely bottle of botanical gin – so fancy! – appeared in my grocery basket. Now, months later, I ask myself: am I the only one drinking more than ever?Obviously, and let me say this very clearly: I am not drinking nearly as much as my friends. Did you hear that at the back? It’s important. I’m drinking much, much less than all the others. There have been no bulk-buying booze grabs to Aldi for me, or secret shameful recycling trips, or wine hidden in mugs during Zoom meetings, or falling asleep obliterated after the living room pub quiz. Oh no, I have standards.Still, smug comparison is the cornerstone to each of us slipping an extra bottle in the trolley in order to cope with the A-levels fiasco. Or the next round of redundancy rumours. Or the shock twist that people seeking mortgages are being rejected for accepting the government’s self-employed income support. Or maybe, like me, your mother’s CT scan has been delayed for three months for no apparent reason and gaining any answers feels like being trapped in an MC Escher sketch.All of these events pair well with a nice cold chablis or a delicate beaujolais and a lie-down on the sofa with your ankles raised. You’ll note I did not say, “a can of super-strength lager and a sit in the park”, because these are the tenets of “having an alcohol problem”, which none of us genteel readers have gained, not remotely. Drinking is never a problem when the booze arrives with charming labels via small-batch, low-intervention vineyards, along with an order of exemplary sourdough and Clarence Court Burford Brown eggs.Or so I thought in July, when I was seduced in Marks and Spencer’s food hall by a gorgeously designed eco-friendly two-litre bag of rosé with an ergonomic wine nozzle which fitted on to the top shelf of my fridge. With one raised hand I could have a neat snifter: perfect for watching the No 10 briefings, or hearing my father’s latest Covid-19 test result. Less Shane MacGowan, more Margo from The Good Life. Where was the problem with that? Somewhere through the second bag, I remembered the old deadpan joke we used to make about my late aunt Julia, who claimed to “only ever have one drink a night”, except that drink was a two-litre box of Santa Maria Vin de Table before the inevitable fall down the stairs.But as I say, this is only for summer. By autumn, the government seems to believe, we’ll all be soberly back at our desks, work stations or spots on the factory floor. Or will we? Forgive me for being a negative Nelly, but I can’t see it. Every time I hear of the great return to normal, I envisage Rishi Sunak pirouetting through Great Britain clutching an extra-large butterfly net, scooping pointlessly at fresh air. He’d have a better chance of rounding us all up.Anyone who has called a corporate customer services line recently will be familiar with a country quite at home, working flexitime in its pyjamas. Last week I attempted to locate a missing insurance claim, finally admitting defeat after the third time I was transferred to someone patently snug as a bug in a rug, who was emitting the correct sympathetic phrases, but in a manner that suggested no notes were being taken. Being child-free, I have no idea how parents are supposed to plan a September work diary while the arguments about schools reopening rage on. My main point of reference for this is the BBC sitcom The Brittas Empire, in which Carol, the leisure centre receptionist, kept her three children in drawers under the desk, leaving her partially available to check in guests.In the great autumn return to work, has Rishi factored in all the pissed people? Life is still incredibly difficult out there, and the boon about working from home is that the sun is always over the yardarm. So here’s to a chipper autumn, full of workplace chaos, cancelled bonfire and Halloween parties, and a scuppered, socially-distanced Christmas. I think I’ll be drinking to that, too.

My generation has shown itself to be robust and ready to make changeThe night that the schools closed we lit a fire in a field and danced like it was the end of the world, dizzy on diet lemonade and vodka.I had had two days to say goodbye to the people I had seen five days a week for seven years – people I had grown up with, people who had shaped me. For two years I had seen my life as “the time before exams” and “the time after”, so now I had to work out what to do when suddenly the structure in my life had been taken away, when the destination I had been running towards suddenly disappeared.Under lockdown, I feared that I wasn’t doing enough reading or writing, or anything. Would a future Cambridge student just sit and watch Netflix all day? Isolation taught me how much of myself was simply an extension of my friends, and how that was a great thing. It taught me about how much I loved them and needed them in my life. At a time when I wanted to tell them this, when I wanted to touch them and cling to them, I couldn’t.Before lockdown, my mam worked full time, and I would be at school till late. We were “like two ships in the night”, she used to say. We then became two little rubber dinghies tied together and bobbing along. It was a big change, seeing each other all the time. We are so similar it was like an experiment into what it would be like to live with myself.I was raised primarily by my mam, gran and sister, and I would not have it any other way. I think single mother and daughter relationships distinguish themselves from other familial relationships. For me, there is something beautiful and completely natural about the shared energy. When we argue, we have the force of two volcanoes erupting at the same time. Our relationship has changed, in that I have started to see her not just as a mother but as another woman. As a friend.I wrote a journal every night from 20 March through to 14 June. At the time it felt like a useful coping method, and it was for a while, until it turned into more of a compulsion. Looking back at it, it reads like something from a post–apocalyptic movie, each entry starting with “day x of lockdown”. Some days I wrote pages and pages, writing about how I felt, questioning who I would be when this ended. Other days the entries were sad and short: “a nothing day”, the term that came to represent the days I could not leave my bed.Then there were the moments of much wider significance: Boris Johnson catching coronavirus, Dominic Cummings’ trip to Barnard Castle, the killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed. All of these large events are woven in alongside seemingly more mundane teenage things – missing my friends and my social life. A recurring character in my journal is results day. I think I began to see that as The End. My ramblings almost describe 13 August as a finishing line.I was never confident about how the results would be handled – how was I supposed to feel safe with my future in the hands of a government run by a party that had systematically underfunded my childhood? As 13 August got closer, and more information became available about how results would be awarded, I felt more and more detached.After Scotland’s results day, which resembled a postcode lottery, my friends and I stopped describing our forthcoming results as something we had earned and instead as something we had been given. To the government and Ofqual, we were not iniduals but statistics. It came as no surprise to us that private schools had done better under the algorithm that was used. The confusing morning of 13 August was spent mostly comparing the grades our teachers had given us with Ofqual’s. I was fortunate in that I came from a state school with a history of good results – others were not so lucky. In the end, the government was forced to U-turn.We are the generation who are about to venture into adulthood during the biggest recession in this country’s history. The generation who will try to be young and carefree during a global pandemic, clutching grades awarded for exams we did not sit. But when I see the headlines telling me my generation is cursed or ruined – that our mental health is on the decline and the future is horrific – I will remember these curious months when time slowed down.The road trips. The walks through the park, light breaking through the leaves. The marches through town, placards in hand, demanding a fairer world. The cold, early-morning trips to the sea to watch the sunrise. My generation has shown itself to be resilient, robust and ready to make change.

Should all children and staff be required to wear masks, or only some age groups? Should children be tested for the virus? How should social distancing be managed in the classroom and playground? And finally, should schools be reopening at all?With a recent sharp resurgence in virus cases, France has issued some of the most detailed guidelines for when schools reopen. Children in secondary schools will have to wear face coverings at all times when in school and in the playground, the education minister said on Thursday, as France reported a record number of daily coronavirus cases since the easing of restrictions.This is a change from recommendations in July that face coverings for older children would only be necessary where 1-metre social distancing could not be managed, and is a response to concerns from teaching unions about rising infections as the summer has gone on.While there were class size restrictions when French schools first reopened, in the new term there will be no size limits and the 1-metre social rule is advised but is not mandatory.Poland plans to reopen schools next week for the first time since mid-March despite reaching a record high number of daily registered coronavirus infections late last week.It has said it will not mandate mask wearing for children in the classroom. However, it has said inidual principals can decide to impose face coverings in school halls and locker rooms. Unlike in some other countries, no temperature checks at the school gates will be introduced.With one of the world’s highest per capita death rates from Covid-19 during the pandemic, Belgium has looked closely at the issue of masks in the classroom. When schools reopen on 1 September all children aged 12 and above and teachers will be required to wear masks, following an announcement by the prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, last week.“The goal is to avoid a second wave,” she told a news conference. “We see today that the situation is stabilising and improving. It is very important that children go to school.”Germany has drawn attention in recent days because of the experience of Berlin where, after reopening in the last fortnight, several dozen schools have had to close because of infections.Officials say most infections in Berlin involve only one teacher or student, and suggest that the transmission occurred outside the school.Berlin has responded by closing schools for very brief periods to allow contact tracing. “So far, these are isolated cases and not outbreaks,” Valerie Kirchberger, a paediatrician and coordinator of Berlin’s testing strategy, led by Charité hospital, told local media.Unlike in countries where education is organised on a national level, German schools are run regionally. While some German states have made face coverings mandatory at all times in schools, in others they are compulsory only in hallways and playgrounds. More generally, schools across the country have tried to manage the risk of infection by keeping classes separate.Regarded as one of the world’s most intensive education systems, South Korea struggled with reopening, delaying restarting schools multiple times and then phasing in different age groups.While a resurgence of infections in the country forced schools to close again, they have resorted to numerous tactics to keep operating, including attendance on alternate days and temperature checks.One of the first western countries to reopen its schools, in April, Denmark separated younger children into “micro-groups” of 12 known as “protective bubbles”.With school starting times staggered and desks 2 metres apart, masks were not deemed necessary. However, Denmark had relatively low infection numbers in the wider population, the result of quick and effective early suppression of the kind advocated by the British public health expert Devi Sridhar, who has emphasised that suppressing community transmission is ultimately what will make schools safe.As of 18 May, children aged 12-16 had returned to secondary schools following similar rules.Israel has emerged as one of the major cautionary tales. Having managed its initial outbreak relatively successfully, it reopened its schools in May, initially sending a limited number of classes children back in small “capsules” to minimise the risk of transmission. In a surprise move, however, the government then announced that all grades could return and lifted restrictions on class sizes.The reopening contributed to a resurgence of the virus, with tens of thousands of pupils later sent into quarantine as their classmates tested positive.Underlining the differing considerations in different parts of the world, Kenya’s schools will not reopen until at least January. As David Lagakos and Emilie Yam wrote in a piece for the World Economic Forum’s website, “low-income countries face a very different set of circumstances from high-income countries – for example, a higher proportion of households that include both children and elderly people … and the urgency of maintaining the livelihoods of working-age adults to prevent hunger and poverty.”With a school year running from January to November, officials have relied on the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to run school programmes via the radio, TV and internet since students stopped going to classes in March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fe013e5933588534d19df7824a75c88bb9ba791/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0084766f3d9e625ee862d72fb38228ba","title":"country diary even in storm battered fields there are seeds of hope","story":"Barton-le-Willows, North Yorkshire: Wind and rain have all but destroyed the harvest, but near the crops is a mass of wildflowers, with seeds peppering the soilA borrowed yellow combine lurks behind a hedge, where it was left at 10 o’clock last night. My friend Richard Hudson, the farmer, had worked 17 hours on his birthday. “We were determined to keep going because we knew the weather was coming,” he says. “But eventually the machines couldn’t cope. I mean, look at it.” Barley stems, toppled every which way by wind last week, have been laid lower still by hammering rain.Richard plants spring crops because it’s better for the environment and his cash flow, he tells me. “They need lower inputs, we can drill direct so we don’t have to plough, and we can leave winter stubble – it suits this land, and the skylarks especially. But it’s a risk.”The dry spring was brutal for farming: growth stalled and many spring-sown crops nearly died. Rain eventually revived them but secondary stems put out by recovering plants matured a full month after the primary shoots. The earlier heads litter the ground, having dropped while Richard waited for the rest to ripen, but now there is a risk of losing the lot. It is his worst harvest in 14 years.In another field, there is chaos of a different kind. Around a central crop of millet and sunflowers – a winter bird banquet – there is a 10-metre-wide, waist-deep tangle of clover, vetch, poppies, melilots and milk thistle, sown for pollen and nectar. Wading in, my jeans are soon soaked. I crouch and push aside a sodden thatch of vetch, loosing a small explosion of white moths. And beneath the thatch – oh! It’s a forest in miniature, with wildflower stems instead of soaring trunks, and gnats flying among them like tiny birds. The air there is warm, humid and perfectly still. The soil between the stems is bare, but peppered with seeds. This is where hope has hunkered down.As I leave, a handful of finches burst from one of the broad, shaggy hedges. Their trajectory is that of broadcast seed, a low, fast, dispersive arc. Then the wind catches them and whisks them away in a formation too loose to be a flock, each bird riding its own flume of air over the storm-battered fields."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9940f2eb27054f8608c0d3fd6192132fa9a5513b/0_0_1200_800/master/1200.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9730f2b16abd080f73b4185f30c9aadc 960w","title":"the best glowy face powders","story":"I’ve found the holy grail of light-as-helium finishing products, as well as a cheaper optionI never thought I’d wax lyrical about face powder in late August, but it’s testament to how obsessed I am with Hourglass’s new vegan-friendly Ambient Lighting Infinity Powder (£49) that I simply cannot wait until autumn.First, a caveat: there are reasons some of you will want to avoid it. It’s pearlescent, not mattifying, it doesn’t blur pores, comes in only one shade (more on the way, I hear) and costs about as much as a tank of petrol (I drive small). But if you happen to be looking for a noticeably glowy, light-as-helium finishing powder to set makeup without a hint of chalk, ash or caking, this is the holy grail. I’ve worn it every day since it landed on my desk, moving it from pocket to handbag to glove compartment lest I find myself in need. Brushed all over bare face or makeup, it gives skin a beautiful dimension – much like its big sister, Ambient Powder, but with a tiny portion of sparkle loaned from its middle sibling, Strobe Powder (the product is effectively the two swirled together). The balance is exactly right for someone of dull complexion who craves the glow of modern makeup, minus the disco mirrorball finish only the young and pore-free can carry off (if you’re still scared, confine to cheekbones, brow bones and nose tip).Do I love it as much? No – it’s a little more powdery. But in terms of glow comparability, it sits somewhere between Hourglass Ambient Infinity and MAC’s ultra-flattering Skin Finish Natural (an old favourite I’ve said quite enough on it already), and represents phenomenal value.If you have a little more to play with, and seek a subtler glow with zero gle, I’ve recently revisited Laura Mercier’s woefully underrated and cruelty-free Candleglow Sheer Perfecting Powder (£32.50).

Not the watches, mind, but street-side snacks comprising Indian chapatis cooked with eggs and vegetables, and rolled up - hence “rolled eggs”, or “rolex”. Mum says she remembers eating a more basic version in her youth, sometimes made with eggs and sometimes with chickpea flour, which is a store-cupboard staple in every Indian kitchen and the basis of today’s recipe. As with sandwiches and burritos, there are now endless variations on the rolex theme, but for today we’re travelling back to a particular time and place: my grandparents’ kitchen in Arua, Uganda, in 1971.I’ve adapted the traditional recipe by replacing ordinary water with fizzy.

Throw them all into the batter and stir to combine.Put a teaspoon of oil in a nonstick pan roughly the same size as your chapatis and heat until very hot. When very hot, ladle in a sixth of the batter and swirl it around the pan quickly, so it covers the whole surface. Leave to cook for about two and a half minutes, until the bottom is golden brown, then flip and cook for another minute and a half on the other side. Lay a chapati on top of the pancake to warm up, then flip out on to a plate (so the chapati is now on the bottom) and repeat with the remaining oil, batter and chapatis – the pan will be very hot, so you may need to reduce the cooking time for the other pancakes.To serve, drizzle over your choice of condiment – I like a combination of sriracha and mayo with some fresh coriander – roll up tight and eat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc58bd5b0f90c26e521097354126f447334acd5a/0_1728_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1831c86356d49aa494c789d6c906413f","title":"rosie sykes recipes for roasting pan suppers","story":"Minted roast chicken with potatoes, baked farinata with an olive dressing, baked mussels with tomato and fregola ... and if all that sounds too fancy, how about sausages and beans?Mint sauce is the secret weapon in this dish.

When the chicken is done, lift it out and leave to rest in a warm place.Add the peas to the contents of the roasting pan and put it back in the oven for 15 minutes – if there’s still a lot of liquid surrounding the vegetables, turn up the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6, to help the liquid reduce while the peas cook.

Put the chickpea flour, baking powder and a teaspoon of salt in a bowl, make a well in the centre, pour in the reserved chickpea liquid made up to 300ml with warm water, and whisk smooth.

Its founder has said the BBC is a “disgrace” that “is bad for Britain on so many levels” and “needs to be broken up”.A rival project is being devised in the headquarters of Rupert Murdoch’s British media empire by the former Fox News executive David Rhodes, although it is unclear whether it will result in a traditional TV channel or be online-only.Both are pitching to a perceived gap in the market for opinionated video output fuelled by growing distrust of the BBC among some parts of its audience, especially on the political right over culture war issues such as Brexit and whether Rule, Britannia! should be sung at the Last Night of the Proms.The prize is twofold: the political influence that would come with breaking the BBC and Sky’s control of British rolling news, along with the potential profits if it is possible to replicate some of the enormous audiences that tune in to watch opinionated talkshow hosts in the US, where Fox News is hugely profitable.GB News is the work of a company called All Perspectives, controlled by two British-American executives who are associated with the US billionaire John Malone. Known as the “cable cowboy”, Malone chairs Liberty Global, the owner of Virgin Media, as well as the parent company of the Discovery television network.Andrew Cole, one of the co-founders of GB News, also sits on the board of Liberty Global. He told the  he hoped to be able to discuss the project in September, but he has previously made clear his views on the broadcasting landscape.He told his LinkedIn followers that the BBC was “possibly the most biased propaganda machine in the world” and to “watch out for announcements of famous presenters and the launch of a completely new TV news channel for the UK – one that will be distinctly different from the out-of-touch incumbents”. He added: “The people need and want this new perspective.”Sources with knowledge of the project suggested GB News was in discussions with Discovery about a tie-up, with the potential for an announcement in September. It has a licence in place and while this does not guarantee the channel will make it to air – or that it will be called GB News – it means Ofcom has been provided with the outline business case, distribution plans and intended audience. Discovery declined to comment.The challenge both projects face is the UK’s strict broadcast rules on due impartiality, enforced by the media regulator. One possible route around them is to follow the lead of the radio station LBC, which has achieved record audiences by realising that the rules can be interpreted to allow strongly opinionated presenters, so long as they are balanced out elsewhere in the schedule with alternative viewpoints.A similar model has been followed by Piers Morgan’s outbursts on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, which regularly become talking points online and drive substantial traffic to tabloid newspapers. News UK’s TalkRadio has pushed this tactic further, with regular debates on culture war hot topics rapidly turned into clips shared on social media.Rhodes, who was hired by News UK in the spring and most recently served as president of CBS News, is said by sources at the company to have the backing of Lachlan Murdoch, the heir apparent to the business empire. He has been seen taking an interest in the TalkRadio model. A News UK spokesperson declined to comment on the suggestion that a fully fledged news channel was in the works but confirmed he was continuing to work on “video projects”.One of the great unknowns of any such project is the role of Nigel Farage. The former Ukip leader left LBC amid staff anger over his comments on migrants crossing the Channel, but he has the potential to deliver a ready-made anti-BBC, pro-Brexit audience. He has recently appeared on the Sun’s YouTube channel and TalkRadio, both owned by News UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f37e51f606ebe7dc66de075ab470ff414822fb/0_137_3579_2148/master/3579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8fac7795af3e501f936f5f0b609a65","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

It will try to make sure late applicants have at least some funding in place at the start of term.Remind me how it all worksStudent finance is the official government funding for university tuition fees and living costs.The tuition fee loan covers course fees and is paid directly to your university or college.The maintenance loan is designed to help with living costs such as accommodation and food. How much you get depends on your household income, where you are living and where you’ll be studying. It is typically paid directly into your bank account at the start of each term.Both must be paid back once you graduate and are earning above a minimum salary.You must apply to the student finance body in your country.

Each country within the UK has its own rules, so it depends where you live. It’s complicated, and a lot comes down to household income. For example, in England for 2020-21, the maximum loan for a student living at home is £7,747 and the minimum £3,410.

A top priority for EU trade negotiators, these rules bar English or Spanish vintners from calling their sparkling wine champagne, for example, while only crumbly cheese from Greece can be labelled feta. Under the withdrawal treaty, the protection applies “unless and until” a new deal can be negotiated.According to EU sources, the UK is attempting to water down protection for EU geographical indications, while keeping the special status for British produce, such as Scotch whisky, Melton Mowbray pork pies and Cornish pasties.The return of the proposal, floated in the early stages of trade talks last spring, caused astonishment. “The asymmetry was met with open mouths. Why would you even suggest that in a serious negotiation?” said the EU source. Barnier was “a little bit flabbergasted”, the person added.The government disputes the EU description of its proposal and argues Barnier is making unprecedented demands to tie Britain to European standards – demands, it says, not made on other trade partners such as Canada or Japan.A UK government official said the British proposal on specialty foods was “in line with the withdrawal agreement” and would provide protection for existing and future GIs for both sides “as is standard” across the EU’s free-trade agreements. “The UK proposal would allow existing EU GIs that meet the requirements of the UK’s new domestic regime to be protected in the UK,” the official said.British negotiators argue they signed up to the food provisions in the withdrawal treaty in the expectation they would be superseded by a future deal.Frost, a former chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, which campaigns to stop foreign rivals using the name “Scotch”, included the GI proposal in a draft trade agreement he hoped would inject new momentum into the stalled negotiations.But the British “consolidated text” has gone down badly in Brussels. In trade negotiations, usually both sides work out a consolidated text once they have agreed on general principles. The British text is said to incorporate wording on which both sides agree, but also highlights areas of disagreement.One EU diplomat, who had not seen the text, said it was “not very useful because it focused mainly on offensive issues for the UK”, meaning issues where the government is seeking an advantage.The UK has not said if it plans to publish the text sent to Barnier.Sandro Gozi, an Italian MEP elected on the ticket of the French centrist party La République En Marche, cast doubt on whether the UK intended to unwind the protected food provisions of the withdrawal agreement. “If it was real, from a French or an Italian perspective, we cannot go back on geographical indications. Geographical indications are the priority No 1 of any new trade agreement for the EU.”Brussels negotiators are warning only a few weeks remain to seal a deal before the EU deadline of late October. “The next negotiation round in September will be crucial,” said a second EU diplomat. “If it ends without any progress as well, the window to close a deal will close quickly. Time would simply be running out.”The EU has said it needs around two months to legally fine-tune and ratify a treaty before the end of the transition period on 31 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b14af2d1e47e6da2acefc0d4c334665579cae3/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=144437919d4808dea82828f12914e93a","title":"mps call on jacob rees mogg extend hybrid parliament system","story":"Leader of Commons keen on full return but opposition parties demand extension of remote working arrangementsMPs are calling on Jacob Rees-Mogg to extend the system that has allowed them to work from home, which is due to expire next week as the summer recess ends.Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has been keen for as many MPs as possible to return to Westminster, with the government hoping to “lead by example” in encouraging employees back to their workplaces.But opposition parties are demanding an extension of the “hybrid parliament” arrangements that allowed them to take part in proceedings by video-link, appearing on large screens in the Commons chamber.Ed Davey, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “Hybrid proceedings are still an absolute necessity. With areas of the UK still in lockdown and the threat of spikes in the virus remaining very real, there will be many parliamentarians and parliamentary staff with good reason for being unable to be in Westminster in person.”Some MPs are warning that they have underlying health conditions while others are in areas where local restrictions are tighter and do not want to risk travelling across the country.Andrew Gwynne, the Labour MP for Denton and Reddish in Greater Manchester, has documented his struggles with “long Covid” – the long-term effects of the coronavirus suffered by some of those who contract it.He said: “Clearly the government would like MPs to go back to sitting in parliament permanently, but that just isn’t going to be possible for a small number of people. Either for public health reasons, because they’re coming from parts of the country that are facing local lockdowns, and what you don’t want to do is inadvertently become a super-spreader and give it to other MPs who then go back to their own constituencies that are relatively Covid-free and start polluting their own areas. But also, there are people like myself who are still struggling with the long-term impacts of coronavirus.“On a good day I would probably be able to cope OK, but I can’t plan which is going to be my good day and which is going to be my bad day. And my constituents should not be disenfranchised.”The SNP’s spokesman on the Cabinet Office, Tommy Sheppard, said: “The return of parliament is a significant test for the UK government, as we are still in the middle of a global health pandemic and know that social distancing is impossible in parts of Westminster.”He called for the hybrid arrangements to be extended to the end of the year. “In accordance with the guidance for those who live in Scotland, where working from home is possible, SNP members and our staff are encouraged to do so,” he said.During the early stages of the lockdown an electronic voting system was introduced in parliament, but Rees-Mogg later replaced that with voting in person, which caused long, distanced queues to snake through the Palace of Westminster in what sceptical MPs nicknamed the “Rees-Mogg conga”.MPs with health concerns can request a proxy vote, which is exercised on their behalf by party whips. Gwynne said the electronic voting system was preferable. “It’s not for me not to trust the whips, but I would far sooner cast the vote myself and be fully accountable to the electorate than trust my whip to do the job for me,” he said.The hybrid system will expire at the end of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting unless the government tables a motion to extend it. A spokesperson said: “In July we extended arrangements to allow for remote participation in scrutiny proceedings until 2 September. The position will be assessed when the House of Commons returns from the summer recess.”The shadow disabilities minister, Vicky Foxcroft, who has rheumatoid arthritis and was advised to shield earlier in the outbreak, said: “If you look at the government’s own comms on this stuff, it says if you were shielding, work from home if possible your employer should support you to do this. So they’re saying one thing to everybody else and then saying something else in parliament.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29c636822a4eaa9d96e13f3e88881b8af680166e/404_0_4738_2844/master/4738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa3e16c2c0012feee02b988d25f81096","title":"time for a nightingale moment for englands children says watchdog","story":"Exclusive: children’s commissioner calls for mental health support and focus on vulnerable teenagersA “Nightingale moment” for children is needed, providing increased funding, extra training for teachers and counsellors in every school, the children’s commissioner for England has said.Invoking the gargantuan effort taken to build Nightingale hospitals for thousands of Covid patients in a matter of weeks, and the £35bn furlough scheme to save jobs, Anne Longfield said children’s recovery from missing months of school would take up to a year and would have a profound psychological impact.In an interview with the  before millions of pupils return to classrooms in England next week, she said children had made a huge sacrifice during the pandemic, and she urged the government to step up support for the most disadvantaged, warning that a generation could be lost without radical intervention.Longfield called for investment in mental health support for children as schools reopen, a commitment to provide young people with the technology to study remotely in the event of local lockdowns, and a focus on vulnerable teenagers who are at risk of never returning to education.“The government needs to be bold, and on the sort of scale that saw hospitals built in weeks, and workers paid in furlough, to make sure no child is left behind. If not, they risk losing a generation for good. The stakes are simply that high,” she said.“Kids have not had their Nightingale moment during the crisis, but if it comes at this stage, where there’s a determination to do things differently for children and help the most disadvantaged fully in life, that would be a great Nightingale moment to have.”Longfield, who has statutory powers to protect children’s interests, said she hoped the crisis would act as a wake-up call, having exposed gaping inequalities in children’s lives.After schools were closed across the country from March, she welcomed the prime minister’s £1bn catch-up package to support learning, much of it focused on one-to-one and small group tutoring, but she said it was not enough.“We need a step-change in ambition to reverse the increased disadvantage that the pandemic has caused. We need a bold plan to reduce the disadvantage gap and help kids catch up academically. But also we need the right mental health support to help them make the transition back into the classroom. That means training for all teachers and counselling in every school.”Many of the 57,000 people who have died from coronavirus in the UK will have been grandparents, whose grandchildren will be returning to classrooms having suffered bereavement.Calling for proper monitoring of attendance and exclusions “to ensure kids don’t fall through the gaps and end up out of school and out of mind”, Longfield added: “It’s that moment for a complete change in priorities, that not only puts children at the heart of recovery but really understands that if we are going to level up for the whole of society, we have to start with children.”Children should never have to face the same level of disruption to their education again, and further closures should happen only as a last resort, the commissioner said. “It’s an absolutely vital couple of weeks for kids. It’s a big moment. They’ve seen life starting to come back to some sort of normal around them. They’ve seen parents going back to work, restaurants opening up, shops opening up. They’ve had to watch that go by. Now is their time.”In a video Q\u0026ampA with parents released on Friday evening, Boris Johnson stressed that shutting schools again would be a last resort. The prime minister said: “We’re hoping very much that even if there are local lockdowns, which I’m afraid there almost certainly will be, because we are expecting more local spikes, schools should be the very last bit of society that we want to close down again.”Longfield, who is due to leave her post in February after six years, was a vocal critic of the government’s failure to get children in England back to school before the summer holidays. Asked about this month’s exams fiasco, which resulted in a humiliating government U-turn and the departure of two senior civil servants, Longfield said the dramatic downgrades had left children feeling “hopeless”.The government should use the forthcoming spending review to maximise investment in disadvantaged children, she said. She called for focused intervention for 120,000 vulnerable teenagers with a history of being excluded from school and going missing.“After five months out of school, they may now feel school is not part of their lives. They will be the kids who are more vulnerable to violence and grooming and gangs. They will need particular support and encouragement to go into school, and real intervention.“I’m talking about youth workers, working with the police, working with schools and social services to make sure they have a package of support and protection around them so they don’t fall out and become lost.”There have been concerns that the number of children going missing is increasing, and incidents of violence are on the rise.Senior figures from the exams regulator Ofqual, including its chair, Roger Taylor, are expected to face a grilling when they appear before MPs on the cross-party education select committee next week.Sally Collier, who resigned as Ofqual’s chief executive in the wake of the exams crisis, will not be among them, though one committee member said she might yet be summoned if Wednesday’s session left pressing questions unanswered. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is due to appear on 16 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c8a9ff17b00c9e523ba167c9d1a2dc1698d6f89/0_64_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f034afa085295f7c1587851e0f697416","title":"premiership needs to embrace midweek fixtures and stop resisting change","story":"Clubs playing in middle of the week during the Six Nations would boost viewing figures and attract new demographicThe first round of midweek Premiership matches was a qualified success. There were some terrible matches, some decent matches and one exceptional clash, between Bristol and Exeter, and while there are a number of reasons why some of what we saw will not live long in the memory, I have seen enough to form the opinion that midweek matches should become a permanent fixture.That is not to say for one minute that players should be regularly playing three fixtures in a just over a week – one of the main reasons some matches have been low on quality is that the players are knackered – but a remodelling of the schedule to allow for a sustained block of midweek fixtures is an option that needs to be explored.First, let’s look it at from a TV perspective. The viewing figures for the midweek fixtures – round 16 of the Premiership – were higher than at the same stage last season. Back then, they clashed with the Six Nations but that only serves to highlight the point – why not introduce a block of midweek fixtures during the international windows?It is a simple reality that when England are playing, domestic rugby cannot compete in terms of demand and the number of eyeballs, but if clubs were to arrange their matches in the week between two international matches, surely there would be some migration from casual fans. Yes, there are the continuing discussions about an aligned global calendar, which could eliminate the domestic and international crossover, but an outcome that suits all parties is looking increasingly unlikely.Kick-off times and days are always a complex argument. You will always have people for whom they are inconvenient and I’ve had some say that midweek at 6pm is no good because it’s when they put their kids to bed, but you cannot please everybody. It is also a time when a lot of people are looking to tune out from work, shut the laptop and relax, and obviously fewer people are caught up in a commute at the moment.It would also mean that rugby is not competing with football – Champions League and the odd round of Premier League midweek fixtures notwithstanding – and all the other weekend activities that have prevented people from watching rugby in the past.When it comes to the stage when supporters are allowed back into stadiums, it could lead to a different demographic of fans attending matches, but is that necessarily a bad thing? If some clubs are overly reliant on 60- to 70-year-old men, who may well be thinking twice about attending sporting events, then perhaps a switch to targeting families for early evening kick-offs would be more beneficial. Maybe club owners would turn around and fire off a list of reasons why it may not work – alcohol sales may be down, for example – but I do feel it is something that should be explored.Rugby can be traditionally opposed to change but as administrators keep telling us, Covid-19 has brought about a blank canvas and provided the opportunity to wipe the slate clean and come up with new ideas.This past week marked 25 years since the game went professional and the World Rugby chief executive, Brett Gosper, admitted the sport has not moved or progressed as quickly as it should have done. That’s because there has always been a resistance to change.On the pitch, there have been a number of teams who have shown similar conservatism and that has been a bit disappointing. The one match where we saw one team set out their attacking stall and the other try and match it, rather than just try and stop it, produced by far and away the best match since the restart with Exeter’s narrow win over Bristol.That Wayne Barnes, the best referee in the world, was on the whistle was no coincidence either. I don’t mean to be overly critical because some players are having to back up repeatedly at the moment while other clubs are making wholesale changes, which makes continuity so difficult. But I’d have liked to have seen a bit more ambition across the board. The weather has not been great but that’s nothing new in this country. It has been a bit negative but again, some of it will be down to the fact that there is limited training time, so we have to keep the playbook pretty simple.Taking a glass half-full approach, I do think the penny is beginning to drop when it comes to the new breakdown interpretations, judging by how the penalty counts reduced from round one to two. And I wholeheartedly agree with the intentions behind them. We want to celebrate excellent inidual performances from specialist jackallers such as Jack Willis and Ben Curry and it’s great to see those guys rewarded, but at the same time we don’t want to see the ball constantly being slowed down.If we can get quicker ball, greater ball-in-play time, turnovers and unstructured play – those are the ingredients of a good game. We’re talking about competition at the breakdown but legal competition. We get it at the scrum, the lineout and we’re actually getting good legal competition at the breakdown for the first time in years. It’s actually quite hard to cheat at the breakdown now and that has to bode well for the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aaf3dfc3c141f6137019fc890721b01bdb61040/50_0_1820_1092/master/1820.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3943e7b13c1c82ba5f315cdd791003f4","title":"neuralink elon musk pig computer implant","story":"Billionare entrepreneur presented animal during a livestream event to recruit workers for his neuroscience startupThe tech entrepreneur Elon Musk on Friday showed off a pig whose brain he says has been implanted with a small computer.“We have a healthy and happy pig, initially shy but obviously high energy and, you know, kind of loving life, and she’s had the implant for two months,” Musk said of Gertrude, the pig.The billionaire entrepreneur, whose other companies include Tesla and SpaceX, presented during a livestream event to recruit employees for his neuroscience startup Neuralink. He described Gertrude’s coin-sized implant as “a Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires”.Musk co-founded Neuralink in 2016 with the goal of creating a wireless brain-machine interface, something scientists hope can help cure neurological conditions and allow people with paralysis to control a computer mouse.In July 2019, Neuralink unveiled a design that involved implanting tiny electrode “threads” into the brain as well as another device behind the ear. The new device Musk described Friday is much smaller, does not require the visible ear device, and would be implanted in the brain by a surgical robot under local anesthesia.The device is removable, Musk said, and he showed off another pig, Dorothy, whom he claimed had had one of the devices implanted and subsequently removed. “What Dorothy illustrates is that you can put in the Neuralink, remove it, and be healthy, happy and indistinguishable from a normal pig.”While most of the near-term practical applications of wireless brain-machine interfaces are medical, Musk has also expressed a desire that such devices could help human intelligence compete with artificial intelligence, which he considers an “existential threat”. At Friday’s event, the entrepreneur made a number of outsize claims about the potential capabilities of the technology, including that it could be used to summon a Tesla, play video games, or allow a person with a severed spinal cord to walk again.Musk did not present any scientific data to support his claims about the pigs or the devices.Neuralink has raised more than $150m in funding, including $100m from Musk himself. The company employs roughly 100 people, but could soon expand to 10,000, Musk said at the event.Musk also said that Neuralink had achieved FDA Breakthrough Device designation in July, a program that can help expedite the regulatory process for products “that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions”. Such a designation does not mean the device is approved by the FDA.Neuroscience experts say that while Neuralink’s mission to read and stimulate brain activity in humans is feasible, the company’s timeline appears overly ambitious.“Everyone in the field would be very impressed if they actually showed data from a device implanted in a human,” said Graeme Moffat, a University of Toronto neuroscience research fellow.Small devices that electronically stimulate nerves and brain areas to treat hearing loss and Parkinson’s disease have been implanted in humans for decades.Neuroscientists have also conducted brain implant trials with a small number of people who have lost control of bodily functions due to spinal cord injuries or neurological conditions such as strokes. Humans in those trials could control robotic limbs or small objects, such as a computer keyboard or mouse cursor, but have yet to complete more sophisticated tasks.Most of the current cutting-edge research in brain-machine interface is conducted on animals, scientists note, with safety challenges and lengthy regulatory approval procedures preventing larger human trials.Notably, Musk, who has been a frequent source of misinformation about coronavirus in recent months and fought to keep his factories open during the pandemic, did not wear a face mask during his presentation, despite being in a room with dozens of employees, a camera crew and veterinary staff. He eventually put on a mask during a question and answer session."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6adb722af0cf8631e342d83a32cad0d13e24d30e/385_436_6013_3608/master/6013.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6c9efa091ab5cfac06dc1b9d594fcf6","title":"adam buxton dad more proud of me but he was","story":"The podcaster, comic and radio host has made a career out of his insecurities. But uncovering a family secret has helped him find peaceThis is the third time I’ve met Adam Buxton, but the first time I’ve met him on his own. Our first encounter was in 2001, alongside his childhood best friend and frequent comedy partner, Joe Cornish. Back then, they were making the Channel 4 comedy series The Adam And Joe Show, in which the two of them brilliantly, and with often astonishing prescience, satirised pop culture: in a segment titled The 1980s House, they sent up a then-nascent obsession with nostalgia TV (“Early mornings on television in the 80s were very different from today: there were only three and a half channels, all showing popular comedy rodents”) they recreated revered films and sitcoms with stuffed animals (Toytanic! Furends!). It was silly, smart and superbly of its time, and for a certain demographic – ie mine – The Adam And Joe Show remains some of the greatest TV comedy ever made.I next met him 12 years later, this time with his father, Nigel. A former travel editor for the Sunday , Nigel was also regular guest BaaadDad on The Adam And Joe Show, where Buxton and Cornish riffed on Nigel’s conservative persona, getting him to review, witheringly, the Prodigy singles and Tribal Gathering. BaaadDad was beloved by fans, but by the time we met he was a frail 89-year-old, his son now protecting him rather than directing him, gently helping him up steps and prompting his memory. As for Buxton, he seemed a little lost, with Cornish now pursuing a film career (he wrote and directed the sci-fi comedy Attack The Block, and co-wrote The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn). I worried Buxton would be condemned to that graveyard for comedians, a panel show career.Which brings us to today, when, for the first time, I am meeting Buxton on his own. Except he’s not on his own at all, in his lovely house in Norfolk, drinking tea in his picture-perfect kitchen with his wife, Sarah, and their three delightful children. He asks me to keep details of his home and family “vague”, so let’s just say that any enemies are definitely unvindicated: Buxton, 51, has a very nice life. His dark beard is now striped with white like a badger’s back, but he seems otherwise unchanged, except, perhaps a little more calm, a little more content.We are talking in the flat attached to Buxton’s recording studio, which is filled with his father’s furniture. Nigel died in 2015, several months after he came to live with Buxton and his family. Something of a hoarder, his oldest son, who “definitely shares that tendency”, can’t bear to throw away his father’s things. So, on a lovely summer’s day, the two of us sit in what is undeniably an old person’s flat, my feet on a needlepoint footrest. Behind Buxton is a bookcase filled with his father’s books. All around us are photos of Nigel. “I thought, well, this could be a cool place for my children to hang out,” he says, but then adds, “I’m worried it’s slightly mad that I’m building this weird museum in here.”It is a bit mad. But Buxton’s new memoir, Ramble Book, does a lot to explain it. He had been approached to write books before, but always jokey high-concept books. After Nigel died, he decided this was something he could write about “from the heart, and hopefully make it funny”. Even so, he initially avoided what he describes as the “dead Dad” part, sending his editor comedy lists and standalone pieces about train journeys. “Just finding ways not to bare my soul,” he explains. But his editor pushed for more soul, and the best sections of the book are the ones about his father.“Nigel was an older dad and had a very old-school way of dealing with the world,” says Cornish, who has known Buxton since he was 13. “The way he flirted with waitresses, the way he talked about wine – it was really funny. Then he would fly off the handle, and that was funnier to me than it was to Adam.”Nigel had always said his father, Gordon, was “an estate overseer”. But after he died, Buxton discovered Gordon was a servant and Nigel a self-made man. Thanks to Gordon’s employer, Nigel was sent to grammar school, “where he got on his social mobility scooter”, moving on to a boarding school and later Oxford. “It wasn’t that he was a phoney,” Buxton says, “he definitely became the person he was. But he was embarrassed by his background.”Though Nigel played the part of the posh toff well, the edifice supporting it was shaky, not least because he insisted on sending all three children to boarding school. When he lost his job at the Sunday , the scaffolding came crashing down. One of the most painful moments in the book is when Buxton finds a snooty letter from the  to Nigel, rebuking him for not paying back a loan they’d given him (“paying for private school is laudable… but frankly it would seem a folly looking at your figures”). Even more poignant is the copy of a letter his father sent to one of his most cherished friends, David Cornwell, better known as John le Carré. Nigel knew Cornwell from university and, at 66, begged his friend for a £40,000 loan. Cornwell sent a “kind, well-worded refusal”, and Nigel later took his youngest son, David, out of his public school, Haileybury.“That was the thing that really crushed him. I found his notebook after he died and it was semi-coded, and the code he had for feeling depressed or like a failure was ‘Haileyburyitis’. I felt terrible for him because, really, Dave’s totally fine,” Buxton says.The letters had been carefully preserved in an envelope on which Nigel had written: “Financial crisis, of interest to anyone should they come to write my life story.” “I think he had that journalist’s mindset: keep notes, keep everything,” Buxton says. “But really, I think he was preserving his own legend, as I do, too.” The discovery made him re-evaluate their relationship: “I always thought he was disappointed that I was letting the side down.” It turned out to be more complicated.Buxton went to Westminster school in London, but was never especially academic, botching his A-levels, retaking them and getting into Warwick University, only to drop out and go to art school. When he started out in TV, he avoided any reference to private school in interviews, and squirms a bit even now. “After Dad died, I thought about how hard that must have been for him, when I didn’t do especially well academically, how important all that had been to him…” He trails off. All around us is the paraphernalia his father kept to project an image of educated poshness. This was what Nigel wanted to bestow on his children, and his eldest son first rejected and now preserved it.If Nigel’s money troubles didn’t bite until after Buxton left school, they lurked in the background. Cornish remembers that Buxton used to “get a bit angry… And I think that was probably because of the disparity between the very privileged world around him, and what was happening with his dad.” Louis Theroux, another of Buxton’s schoolfriends, recalls the same tension. “Adam was never into weed, but Joe and I were and we’d be all mellow. Adam would drink beer and he’d get all grrrr.”Neither is surprised he’s written a memoir. “He was always interested in making sense of his inner life. At school, he loved what he called ‘deepies’,” Theroux says, referring to Buxton’s then-word for deep conversations.“He’s kept every video, every bit of ephemera, every scrapbook,” Cornish agrees. But even this doesn’t prepare me for his archive. When he shows me into his studio-barn, the first thing I notice is a stack of drawers, each carefully labelled with the names of his schools, his art college, his friends, all dated. There are not just reports and essays, but old travel cards and birthday cards. Huge bookcases contain thousands of CDs and cassettes, including the kind most of us threw out in 1997 (“Dance Mix 17!”). Multiple shelves are set aside for recordings taken from baby monitors when his children were little, each one carefully labelled. I haven’t even mentioned the piles of diaries and old invites. Why keep all this stuff?“Partly self-importance and vanity. Also, it became this party trick, because every time people came round I could go, ‘Remember this?!’ It was like having a pocket time machine,” he says. Plus, he says, “I’m just frightened of not having anything to show for it all at the end.”Buxton’s parents had a fractious relationship. “It was uncomfortable sometimes to see how harsh my dad could be with my mum,” he says. They split up soon after their youngest child left home. Nigel occasionally half-joked about coming to live with him, and Buxton would “shudder at the thought”. But when he was diagnosed with cancer, Buxton moved him in, thinking it might be a chance to get to know his father. But Nigel was not really a man for deepies and Buxton ended up being his carer, checking he took his pills, helping him when he became incontinent.Buxton took in his mother, Valerie, earlier this year. By that point, her memory was starting to go, but one phrase she repeated was, “You did such a great thing, taking in Daddy, because he’s a difficult man, you know.” She died this spring. She had been “totally fine” with Buxton writing a book about his father, he says, but when he rereads it now, “I realise it was Mum who was always my ally. That’s one of those things about families: the people you have the trickier relationship with are the ones who make the bigger impression. The ones who really love you, you end up taking for granted.”He had already finished his book when his mother started to get ill. But he talked about her death in a moving episode of his podcast this summer, and the person he invited on was Cornish. After some banter about the TV they’d been watching in lockdown, Cornish asked how Buxton was doing. “Not that good,” Buxton replied, and the two embarked on a proper deepie. Recalling his mother’s last day with them, Buxton cried. Cornish knew when to offer reassurance, when to stay quiet and when to start making jokes again it was the sound of someone getting their best friend through their worst time.While Buxton and Cornish have both found success inidually, for a certain kind of fan (me), the real joy comes from listening to them talk to one another, as on their former XFM and 6 Music shows. They have the kind of joyful, natural conversational style that only comes from a 40-year friendship between two people on the same wavelength. They started making films together when they were teenagers – including my personal favourite, one of Buxton, Cornish and Theroux dancing to Groove Is In The Heart when they were about 20.Channel 4 gave them their own show when they were only 27, after Buxton entered some of their videos into a talent competition. But making it put some strain on the friendship Buxton would agonise over tiny details, for example spending days making curtains the viewers would hardly see. “There were sometimes whole sections of the show that were left blank, even just a week before transmission, because it was a bit Adam had to do, and he would get furious if you mentioned it,” Cornish says. “And then he’d deliver it and it would be amazing. That’s why the podcast is so perfect for him – he can control everything.”They quarrelled occasionally there were, Buxton says, some “uncomfortable conversations in wobbly voices”. More painful was when Cornish decided to stop co-hosting their 6 Music show, to focus on film-making. “All my insecurities were tweaked,” Buxton says. Did they ever properly fall out? He is horrified: “We preferred to manage our resentments in private rather than confront them. We always got on when we met up, and within three minutes we’d be laughing about some bad film we’d seen. Then we’d not see each other for a while, because I was in Norfolk and he was between London and Quentin Tarantino’s pool house and Steven fucking Spielberg’s bouncy castle.” He adds: “In case it’s not clear, that was mock envy with a very tiny pinch of truth.”He has always been “Mr Emotional”, as he puts it, whereas Cornish is more teasing, and at times on the radio you could hear Buxton’s hurt bafflement at his friend’s blunter comments. Buxton recalls that soon after they left school he asked Cornish if they’d still be friends in 10 years. “I don’t know, man, probably not,” he casually replied. Thirty years later, the comment burned enough for Buxton to put it in his book.At the end of the audio version of Ramble Book, there is a conversation between the pair in which Cornish brings up that comment, which he had long forgotten: “I think I was probably looking for the most provocative answer. My brain issues the true standard answer and then thinks, well, that’s a bit boring, what would be more interesting?” You can hear Buxton gasp, re-evaluating 40 years of casual banter. “I think the relationship worked creatively because we are very different, but I never understood that,” he says now, smiling. Buxton’s emotional openness is surely partly a reaction against his father despite being sent to boarding school when he was nine, I have rarely met a man less afraid to show his vulnerabilities. Another reaction against his father is Buxton’s marriage. He and Sarah have been married for 19 years, after meeting through another school friend. “She looked like Sean Young in Blade Runner, and we were both a little oversensitive, so we bonded. Also, she’s tall. Joe’s tall, Louis’s tall, I do seem to be attracted to tall people because I’m short.” It was Sarah who forced him to look at how harsh his father could be to his mother. “At first I was defensive, but then I understood that she just doesn’t want me to turn out like that,” Buxton says.Our interview has very much turned into a ramble chat. When I first arrived at his house, I worried that Buxton was weighed down by the past. But now it feels more that he simply surrounds himself with happy memories he loved his parents, he loves his friends – why shouldn’t he keep mementoes from them?Plus, there are clear benefits to being able to relive the past. Buxton always knew his father was baffled by his interests – that was the whole joke of BaaadDad. Recently, he has been watching old outtakes from The Adam And Joe Show. “We shot absolute hours of stuff with my dad, making him go to places that he hated, and he was always game. It was heroic. I used to think, ‘Why isn’t he more proud of me?’ But he was proud. I can see that now.” • Ramble Book by Adam Buxton is published 3 September (HarperCollins, £16.99, or £14.78 from the bookshop)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62b4faf313a74be95f5f195b786526f7a07e42d5/0_110_5483_3290/master/5483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b05a5901e17846e467d9cdf95a2a37b","title":"michaela coel isnt buying anything new oxfam second hand september","story":"From Chewing Gum to I May Destroy You, the writer and actor has carved out a groove as a true original. Who better to convince us all to shop secondhand?Michaela Coel could be wearing anything she wanted, right now. As the star and creator of I May Destroy You, the BBC drama that became a water cooler hit even in a summer without water coolers, Coel is the hottest property in town. Any fashion designer would jump at the chance to dress her. But today she is enthusing over a time-pummelled black sweatshirt with faded insignia, sourced not from a Bond Street boutique but from Oxfam’s cavernous warehouse in Batley, North Yorkshire. “I’m here for it,” she murmurs approvingly, pulling it over her head.She’s here for all of it. She’s here for the pale pink Burberry trenchcoat, another Batley treasure unearthed for our shoot by Oxfam’s senior fashion adviser, Bay Garnett, a nod to Coel’s neon bubblegum bob as Arabella in IMDY. She’s here for the dynamite 80s jeans and matching jacket in toffee-apple faux-leather, a rare Gaultier Jeans find. She’s here for the Fanta-coloured boilersuit (think Ripley in Alien meets Bananarama on Top Of The Pops), for the elegant 70s Jaeger mustard blazer with anchor-stamped gold buttons, and for a knockout pair of Versace high-waisted shorts, illustrated with classic Rita Hayworth film posters.Coel has a distinctive, three-tiered expression, when she is introduced to someone new. Instantly recognisable from screen, it is even more mesmerising in real life. She opens her eyes extra wide, drops her mouth slightly open for a moment, the high planes of her cheekbones catching the light, before veering into a mile-wide smile. The combination of split-second comic timing and diamond-cut bone structure is dynamite, and Coel has the whole studio transfixed. Ahead of our shoot, she has asked not to be interviewed about her work, because she is feeling talked-out on the subject. Instead she is here to lend her star power to a cause, as the face of Second Hand September, an Oxfam campaign to encourage people to pledge not to buy new clothes for the entire month.Think of it as dry January for clothes addicts. Oxfam hopes that the campaign, now in its second year, will establish itself on the calendar in the same way. In normal times, September is the month when summer dresses are packed away, and the trend cycle reboots – hence those hefty September issues of the glossy magazines, full of new-look wishlists. Second Hand September takes this principle of the wardrobe reset and reframes it, challenging consumers to find new looks with old clothes instead. Last year 62,000 people, including Vivienne Westwood, Rachel Weisz and Paloma Faith all signed up.Coel has long taken an independent approach to fashion, wearing a dress made with Ghanaian kente cloth for her first red carpet moment, the 2016 Baftas. (She won two of the three categories in which she was nominated for her breakout series, Chewing Gum.) So when she was approached by Oxfam, Coel says, she “felt compelled to add my voice to this cause. I hope it raises awareness and encourages us to reflect on our buying habits. Small changes can have a huge impact on the environment – and, in turn, the fight against poverty.”On set, Coel’s phone blasts out an eclectic mix of music. Sixties soul singer Barbara Lewis pops up in between new tracks by Californian band Thee Sinseers and female British rap artist Lex Amor. The clothes Garnett has chosen, likewise, are cool and contemporary, even when they are decades old. “Nothing looks more contemporary than great thrift stuff,” Garnett explains. “When you get it right, it doesn’t look retro at all.”The clothes on the rail today are taken from 1,500 pieces she handpicked to stock an Oxfam “luxury pop-up” at Selfridges in London, which opens on 7 September. “I’ve got a brilliant flying jacket. I’ve got a print that could be Prada. I’ve got three great Ossie Clarke dresses and an incredible 1970s sequin gown with a tiger at the hem. But with Oxfam price tags.” In a premium space on the second floor – slap bang next to Prada, Celine and Balenciaga – the shop will be “almost like a fake luxury store,” says Garnett, “with all the bells and whistles of that space. Marble, velvet, lots of room.” (Selfridges is funding the fit-out.) “Look, first of all, it’s fun,” she says. “I’m not here to lecture anybody. But I do sort of hope people do a double-take.”Garnett has championed secondhand clothes as high-fashion catnip all through her 20-year styling career. For the May 2003 edition of British Vogue, she put Kate Moss in a banana-print leotard top and white denim shorts, both thrift store discoveries. Her friend Phoebe Philo, then designer at Chloé, saw the magazine, called and asked to borrow the top, and the look became the inspiration for Chloé’s spring 2004 collection – followed by most of the British high street.When she worked at Vogue, the then editor, Alexandra Shulman, used to tell Garnett that she had a knack for making designer clothes look as if they came from a charity shop. Garnett recounts this as if it were a prized compliment to her, secondhand is always best. She pulls out herringbone tweed coats to enthuse about the linings, turns silk blouses inside out to coo over the seams.“Secondhand has always felt to me like a more empowering way to shop,” she says. “I like that I’m opting out of the system a bit. I love fashion but I want to do it my way, without being dictated to by big brands with all the money and marketing power.” In her Oxfam role, she adds, it feels “empowering in a more urgent way than ever, because it is tied up with the environment and with clothes being sold to raise funds to help the poorest people in the world. I love the idea of old clothes being that powerful.”Coel would agree, and worked with costume designer Lynsey Moore on the wardrobe for both Chewing Gum and I May Destroy You with a similar principle in mind. “Right from the start, Michaela knew she wanted to use as much secondhand and sustainable clothing as possible,” Moore says. “That suited me because most of my own clothes are from charity shops and vintage stores. Vintage clothes have the best stories.”The fixed point of Arabella’s look was the pink wig, which appeared in the original script. “So I looked out for pink and purple pieces that would tie into that,” says Moore, “to make it feel like the clothes are part of her.” The bold, graphic print cardigan which Arabella wears for her powerful take-down of Zain at the writers’ summit came from Moore’s own wardrobe, bought from a vintage store in London’s Soho. “We could have gone with something more obviously authoritative, but this was more Arabella,” says Moore. She and Coel added shoulder pads to the cardigan for a more powerful silhouette.The current trophy piece in Moore’s own wardrobe is a black denim jacket with collar and pockets intricately embroidered with pearls. “I won it on eBay for £2.50 and I’m obsessed with it. Charity shopping on eBay – that’s my Sunday night treat,” she says. “Designer labels matter if you are looking for resale value, but I shop secondhand by looking at colour and fabric.” She recommends taking a friend with you, “because this is an activity, not just a purchase. It should be fun! Oh, and take a tape measure. If you know your waist measurement, you can see instantly if a pair of trousers will fit you. Saves a lot of time.” If you don’t know where to start, Moore’s tip is to look out for silk shirts: “A good silk blouse in a great colour or print will never let you down. You can wear it tucked into jeans, or layered under a jumper, or loose over a bikini – in 15 years’ time, you’ll still be wearing it.” On set, Coel has pounced on a rose-embroidered mohair sweater with this season’s puff sleeves. It is quirky, but also very now – a lot like her, in fact. And the pandemic has made Coel’s cheerleading for Second Hand September even more urgent. The closure of 600 stores, and the cancellation of major fundraising events including the London marathon and Glastonbury, saw Oxfam lose £5m per month during lockdown. This is dire, at a moment when a global economic downturn threatens the welfare of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. If there is to be a silver lining, it is in the possibility of a post-lockdown reset, as consumers decide not to return to the bad old ways of overconsumption.Every September, the world is looking for a fresh start. A new look, even. But this year, it could be in old clothes.• Find out more about Oxfam’s Second Hand September campaign"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9d0d77115be8eac9a0a423fd5262cd1755cfe5a/0_149_4868_2922/master/4868.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6b5aae7bd14e85b02f4713c3e552566","title":"hurricane laura louisiana devastation lake charles","story":"Lake Charles felt the full force of Hurricane Laura and now residents who rode out the disaster are picking up the piecesClassie Ballou lives on the fifth floor of Chateau du Lac, an eight-story retirement home in the Louisiana city of Lake Charles. “I made it through Rita,” he said from a park bench in the rubble of downtown as he reflected on the fury of Hurricane Laura that had just roared through his home town. “Honestly, I thought it wasn’t going to be that bad.”He shook his head. “If I were doing it over, I would leave.”At 2am Thursday, he woke up to feel the building – which provides a home for disabled residents – swaying back and forth as the category 4 storm hit. His neighbors on the eighth floor felt the roof go at about the same time. Soon, his room was full of water from the rain running through the building.Shalonda Brouchet, who also lives in the building, didn’t trust her car to make it to Houston, so she spent the night as well. Windows began to blow out, and a set of dumpsters began to crash around in the parking lot. “The wind, it just kept coming.”In the morning, Ballou and Brouchet walked the streets of downtown to assess the damage, and then gathered in a covered area under the building with neighbors.“There’s devastation everywhere,” said Ballou, pointing towards the collapsed roof of a home-goods store across the street. “This is the worst I’ve ever seen, and I came up remembering Audrey,” a storm that killed 416 people in the same part of Louisiana in 1957.Matthew Dubone, another resident, said they didn’t expect to hear from their property manager about the habitability of their apartments till Monday. “This building is out of commission,” said Brouchet. There is no electricity and no water, although the rooms are soaked.Now, Dubone said, they survey the wreckage that was Lake Charles and wait for help to come.The cars in the parking lot of their building are mostly ruined, smashed by pieces of the falling roof, and the Texas-bound interstate – where most residents say they would go - is blocked. They have piled frozen chicken thighs and pork chops on a picnic table, along with a bottle of lighter fluid and bag of charcoal briquettes, and are getting ready to cook the meat before it rots.By Friday morning, the storm had moved on, unleashing heavy rain hundreds of miles inland from where the hurricane made landfall, and prompting tornado warnings from Alabama to Tennessee and heavy weather forecasts all the way up the eastern seaboard into Connecticut.But as of early afternoon on Thursday, nobody had told them when or where aid workers might distribute food in the days ahead. On the street outside, a steady stream of trucks rolled by, which they said were focused on clearing downed trees.“Everyone who lives here is disabled. A lot of them left or were evacuated and we was the ones who couldn’t make it,” said another resident, Kelvin Lamplin.Louisiana is still under restrictions designed to cope with the coronavirus pandemic – such as a mask mandate – but in Lake Charles masks were nowhere to be seen on residents, rescue workers and even the soldiers on the crowded national guard convoys rolling through town. Near the town a chlorine plant erupted with thick, billowing smoke after being damaged by the storm. Authorities ordered people around the plant to stay in their homes with windows and doors shut.Laura has headed north of the state as a tropical storm after hitting the Louisiana coast with blasts of wind up to 150mph strong. Officials warned of “catastrophic conditions” and more than 600,000 people fled its path.But not Chrystal and Ben Johnson. They rode out the storm with their family in the historic office building they own downtown. They live 30 miles north of Lake Charles in Ragley, Louisiana, but thought that the building was safer. “This place has 2ft-thick walls, and a pump in the basement,” said Ben. “Houses roar,” said Chrystal, but this building, which was once a post office and court, stayed quiet.Now, anticipating weeks without power, they are planning to drive back north and gather their belongings, and then leave the state. The family is receiving a steady stream of updates about relief efforts nearby. Another family member, chiming in from behind them, said the national guard had begun guarding the local CVS store, and had heard that the Cajun Navy, famous for its civilian rescue effort during Katrina, was still looking for somewhere to set up a base.In front of one of Lake Charles’ few high-rise buildings downtown, a volunteer rescue worker who identified himself only as James described spending the night inside a jammed elevator. He said that he had been in at least 20 storms, and came to Lake Charles on Wednesday to prepare for the aftermath. A friend let him stay inside the tower, home to a Capitol One office, but in the middle of the night, he got antsy about the storm surge, and decided to take a service elevator to the 16th floor.Halfway up, he heard a voice through the speaker that said “Elevator out of service”, and then he was stuck. He had brought meteorological equipment, and watched the pressure drop as the eye of the hurricane passed over. “The barometer dropped an inch. I’ve been in a lot of storms, and I’ve never seen that before.”As the eyewall whipped the city, “something gave, and the whole building shredded”.James was sure that the others who had taken cover inside the tower were gone. But in the morning, he pried open the door and then used a piece of metal to scratch his way through the sheetrock elevator shaft. From there, he had enough service to call for help, and rescue workers smashed the rest of the way through.A few blocks from downtown, 18-year-olds Draven Smith and Aidan Abshire wound through debris-covered streets in a rattling pickup, gathering fallen traffic signs.The pair had waited out the storm in their house just outside Lake Charles after realizing that all the gas stations were closed, and they didn’t have enough gas to evacuate. Like others, the wind, and the shaking, roaring, is what stuck with them. “Surprisingly,” said Abshire, “ours is the only house that’s OK. Roofs are ripped off, fences are all down, windows broken.”As an army corps truck rolled by, they changed the conversation to the rumors of looting they had heard, although they hadn’t seen any themselves.“A hurricane, when it comes through, feels like a big warning, from God,” says Abshire, “A big push that things should change. The looting, the riots. The way people are treating our Earth.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269d11de6177e95b4c3d137e047777c6afae4cf1/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c21c60599fadc79bc138eb6766d23bf","title":"march washington dc racism get your knee off our necks","story":"Tens of thousands of people gathered in Washington DC on Friday, demanding criminal justice reform and voting rights following a summer of protests against systemic racism and against police treatment of Black people.The Get Your Knee Off Our Necks march, announced in early June following the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota, also marks the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr gave his “I have a dream” speechurging racial equality.Thousands gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, many wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts, as speakers demanded racial equality and an end to police brutality in the US.“We get less healthcare, like we don’t matter,” said the civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton, whose National Action Network organization was one of the event organizers.“We go to jail longer for the same crime like we don’t matter. We get poverty, unemployment, double the others, like we don’t matter.“We’re treated with disrespect by policemen that we pay their salaries like we don’t matter. So we figured we’d let you know, whether we tall or short, fat or skinny, light skinned or dark skinned, black lives matter.“And we won’t stop until it matters to everybody.”King’s son, Martin Luther King III, was among those to speak, telling the crowd they must “defend the freedoms that earlier generations worked so hard to win”.Friday’s event comes ahead of a November election expected to see a record number of mail-in ballots, and with a Republican party seemingly opposed to making it easier to vote.“We must vigorously defend our right to vote because those rights were paid for with the blood of those lynched for seeking to exercise their constitutional rights.”The Democrat-controlled house of representatives has passed legislation making voting more accessible in 2019, and recently renamed the bill the John R Lewis voting rights act. The Republican controlled Senate has refused to act on the legislation.Organized by the civil rights campaigner Al Sharpton’s National Action Network and groups including the NAACP and the National Urban League, the speakers at Friday’s rally also highlighted police brutality and the need for reform.The Washington march comes days after Jacob Blake became the latest in a series of Black people to suffer brutal treatment at the hands of police.Blake was shot in the back by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Sunday, and remains in hospital. His family said on Tuesday that Blake had been paralyzed from the waist down.Speaking on Friday, Blake’s father, Jacob Blake Sr, said: “There are two systems of justice in the United States. There is a Black system and a white system and the Black system isn’t doing so well. I’m tired of looking at cameras and seeing these young black and brown people suffer.”Blake’s sister, Letetra Widman, said Black people were done “catering to your delusions”.“America, your reality is not real,” Widman said. “We will not pretend. We will not be your docile slave. We will not be a footstool to oppression.”Widman also called on protesters to continue to march peacefully. “You must fight, but not with violence and chaos – with self-love,” Widman said. She called out loudly: “Black men, stand up. Stand up, Black men, and educate yourselves.”The families of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, all Black people killed by police or by iniduals on the extremist fringes who regarded themselves as vigilantes.The march was organized amid protests over the killing of Floyd.The 46-year-old died after a police officer knelt on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, including the final two minutes when Floyd was unconscious.“The reason why George Floyd laying there with that knee on his neck resonated with so many African-Americans is because we have all had a knee on our neck,” Sharpton told USA Today.The march was set to be the largest political gathering in Washington since the coronavirus outbreak began to escalate in March.The thousands of participants streaming in for the march on Friday morning stood in lines that stretched for several blocks, the Associated Press reported, as organizers insisted on taking temperatures as part of coronavirus protocols.Organizers reminded attendees to practice social distancing and wear masks throughout the program.The march will be matched by demonstrations in states which have a high Covid risk, NAN said, including in Montgomery, Alabama and Las Vegas, Nevada.The NAACP is hosting a “virtual march” throughout the day.Speakers will include the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, from Michigan, and Stacey Abrams.A group of protesters are due at the march who have walked all the way from Milwaukee to the nation’s capital for the event."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6cb283d46f83cdbcb8f1a5aaf6fde297ffdf9d1/0_179_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=047a53a3b0713f8960c81db548108b66","title":"back to school in covid times what can pupils in england expect ","story":"Shorter days, bubbles, alfresco meals and staggered arrivals among measures introducedIt has been a summer of painstaking preparations for headteachers charged with drawing up plans covering everything from new behavioural rules to “Covid-secure” measures before millions of pupils in England return to the classroom full-time next week.Many schools will look different, with spray-painted stencils marking out 2-metre distancing outside, duct tape arrows signalling one-way systems in corridors, forward-facing furniture and desks with clip-on screens so teachers can get closer to younger pupils.What else does the new normal involve for schoolchildren?Many schools will stagger arrival and leaving times and lunchtimes to reduce crowding, resulting in shorter days for some and longer days for others. One mother of three said her four-year-old would have 90 minutes less school time a day. School populations and building sizes are also constraining the use of the bubbles designed to restrict Covid-19 outbreaks. Instead of keeping small groups separate so a limited number of children have to self-isolate in the event of an outbreak, bubbles may be hundreds-strong. At Exeter Road community primary school in Devon, which has around 200 children in its main building and 30 to 50 on a nursery roll, building work has put a third of space available out of action. “If you were going to have pure bubbles then surely each one would have toilet facilities of its own, so we are going to have four fairly large bubbles as a result and we’ll be trying to keep them separate, with staggered entry times,” said the headteacher, Paul Gosling.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, implied this week that parents should avoid lingering at school gates, saying they should drop their children off and “get on with the tasks of the day”.With some canteens off-limits and plans for some classes to eat lunch in the rooms they will be spending much or all of the day in, some schools will use apps to enable children to order their meals.Among schools trialling the app is Hampton High in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames, where the headteacher, Rebecca Poole, says enormous changes have been made. “We’ll be operating a food delivery service from the canteen as we can’t have large numbers of children eating together at the moment, and that’s where the app from our catering company comes in,” she said. Payment would normally be made via fingerprint recognition, but this has been replaced by lanyards.Schools such as Birchwood High in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, have installed outdoor decking under a shelter so that children can eat outside. The principal, Chris Ingate, said: “We have a big indoor cafeteria, but we wanted to make provision for eating outside. It’ll be a bit like going to Costa, you’ll go in and then out, but we’ll have to see how things are in the winter months.”Headteachers pause or take a deep breath when asked the million-dollar question: are you clear on what you’re supposed to do in the event of an outbreak?“It’s not entirely clear what will happen if there is an outbreak, but it’s not for want of trying,” said Ruth Davies, the head of Waunarlwydd primary in Swansea and the national president of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT). Schools have procedures in place for what to do immediately in terms of the isolation of pupils or staff, but whether an entire school or just a bubble would be sent home remains to be seen.Poole said: “Once we’ve isolated the person, made the phone call home and recommended they get tested, it’s somewhat unclear. My view is that test and trace will pick it up and we’ll be advised, but all I can say is that we’ll just have to deploy our professional judgment.” Plans are being made at her school for teachers quarantined at home to stream lessons into the classroom if needs be.With confidence in the government’s track-and-trace scheme at a low ebb, some schools have drawn up rudimentary forms to detail who shared rooms with whom. They include High Tunstall College of Science in Hartlepool, where the head, Mark Trilling said: “I think in reality if someone does come down then in our case the entire bubble of 30 would go into self-isolation. It is a bit confusing and there is no real guidance, but we would draw on our own professional judgment and take advice from the local authority.”Poole and other school leaders say no one can tell when schools might be able to start thinking about relaxing some measures, but she predicts it won’t be for another nine months.“There’s a bit of concern about timetabling, but we will stick with what we’re doing because what children and parents need is clarity,” she said. “We won’t change anything until at least January, and I think we will have to go until at least March.”Davies voiced concerns about staffing, and said the coming six months could be hardest as winter takes its toll. “As soon as we have any semblance of a symptom then that person will be off, and if one or more members of staff go then there will be pressure. A steady stream of supply teachers just won’t be available.”Gosling said he feared a chaotic autumn term with teachers and pupils being sent home in large numbers and a lack of political leadership.Ingate said his main concerns were students who had fallen behind over the last few months, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as the “whole unpredictability” of Covid-19 and the potential for a second wave.“What happens? We’d take would advice from our local authority and health bodies, but I have an instinct that it would probably play out in terms of an increased incident rate in the area rather than the school being the centre. If rates went up, we’d see it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ca67efd4d756a2d95cc79c19eb2ef5e8aa6a4e0/527_357_2857_1714/master/2857.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=290a30e41abc3574f062fc83352a731c","title":"bank of england to stay in emergency mode until recovery ensured says governor","story":" Andrew Bailey insists ‘act big and act fast’ response effective and declares Bank still has ‘firepower’ The Bank of England will stick with its emergency policy setting until it is sure the economy’s recovery from the Covid-19 slump is more than a summer bounce, Threadneedle Street’s governor has said.Andrew Bailey told a symposium of fellow central bank governors that the Bank’s decision to “act big and act fast” during the early stages of the pandemic had proved an effective response to the market panic and economic lockdown.He said that the Bank’s nine-strong monetary policy committee would need a “stronger-than-usual body of evidence” before it would consider removing any of the stimulus provided over the past six months.“This important step is intended to ensure monetary conditions do not tighten prematurely when there are some initial signs of an economic recovery,” he said.The governor said that in order to act speedily and aggressively in the future, the Bank might need to create “headroom” by selling assets back to the markets, but he stressed that it was nowhere near that point yet.“There are times when we need to go big and go fast,” Bailey said. “We are not out of firepower by any means, and to be honest it looks from today’s vantage point that we were too cautious about our remaining firepower pre-Covid. But hindsight is a wonderful thing when you have it.”The governor said the Covid crisis had provided central banks with their first big test since the financial crisis of 2008. “Monetary policy has had to respond to an unprecedented shock. For many central banks, the main tool to date has been further quantitative easing (QE), in unprecedented scale and pace of purchases.”Under QE, the Bank of England creates electronic money so that it can buy bonds from the private sector. The injection of cash is designed to calm financial markets and increase spending power.“Viewed from the depth of the Covid crisis, QE worked effectively,” Bailey said. “Measuring this effect precisely is, of course, hard, since we cannot easily identify what the counterfactual would have been in the absence of QE. But QE clearly acted to break a dangerous risk of transmission from severe market stress to the macro-economy by avoiding a sharp tightening in financial conditions and thus an increase in effective interest rates.”Bailey’s strong backing of asset purchases in his Jackson Hole speech was seen as a strong hint that another dose of QE will be the Bank’s first line of defence in the event that the economy weakens over the coming months.Alongside Bailey’s remarks, the Bank of England published research setting out arguments for reversing some of its asset purchases before raising interest rates – the opposite of the approach under Bailey’s predecessor, Mark Carney.The working paper said the impact of quantitative easing depended heavily on the state of the economy, so it could be possible to withdraw some, creating scope for greater future action, without tightening monetary conditions as much as raising interest rates.“If it is possible to set the appropriate stance of policy using alternative combinations of the policy rate and QE, a combination that provides more space for future QE may be preferable, other things equal,” the Bank said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20b6ceee82d56ab55c54f3216111791579a36992/0_118_813_488/master/813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c85f3fc8e0b0e822153a20423c2221ba","title":"banksy funded boat in state of emergency as it shelters 200 people","story":"Crew of Louise Michel, who rescued 89 migrants on Thursday, say European authorities ignoring themA rescue boat financed by the British street artist Banksy is close to declaring a “state of emergency” after the crew helped 130 migrants and are now safeguarding over 200 people off Libya’s coast, while the European authorities ignore their request for help.The vessel, named Louise Michel after a French feminist anarchist, set off in secrecy on 18 August from the Spanish seaport of Burriana, near Valencia, and is now in the central Mediterranean, where, on Thursday, it rescued 89 people including 14 women and four children.On Friday, the crew of European activists responded to a mayday call by Moonbird, an aircraft that monitors migrants’ boat in danger in the central Mediterranean, which had spotted a dinghy that was not moving and was taking in water.“Louise Michel proceeded at full speed,” a ship spokesperson said. “We handed out life vests to 130 people to secure the situation.”The rubber dinghy is currently located in the Maltese search and rescue zone, dangerously overcrowded and taking in water, with a dead body onboard and several others suffering from fuel burns and injuries, after having spent several days at sea.The passengers had previously contacted the Alarm Phone, an emergency hotline assisting refugees at sea, and requested immediate rescue. Both activists of Alarm Phone and Moonbird alerted European authorities to the boat in distress.The crew alleged that neither the Maltese and Italian authorities reacted adequately.The Louise Michel is currently safeguarding the 130 passengers as the ship is already carrying 89 migrants and can accommodate a maximum of 120 passengers on board.The activists stated that the people had been left alone in a European search and rescue zone and warned: “Don’t let it become a body count. Do your job. Rescue them.”Lea Reisner, head of operations for the Louise Michel, said: “The people have sat in a mix of salt water and fuel for days. It is night and European states are not doing their fucking job. They deny responsibility while we are trying to keep everyone alive … we need immediate assistance.”Neeske Beckmann of the Moonbird said: “We were shocked when we saw the rubber boat – it was incredibly overcrowded and people onboard were trying to shuffle water out of the boat with their bare hands.“We knew this was a grave emergency situation and decided to send out a mayday relay to all authorities and actors in the vicinity. Responsible European authorities failed to react to our distress call and only the Louise Michel responded to this serious distress case.”Painted in bright pink and featuring Banksy artwork depicting a girl in a life vest holding a heart-shaped safety buoy, the Louise Michel sails under a German flag. The 31-metre motor yacht, formerly owned by French customs authorities, is smaller but considerably faster than other NGO rescue vessels.Claire Faggianelli, an activist who prepared the Louise Michel for its first mission, saw the project as a wake-up call for Europe. “We really want to try to awaken the consciousness of Europe and say: ‘Look, we have been yelling at you for years now. There is something that shouldn’t be happening at the very borders of Europe, and you close your eyes to it. Wake up!’” she said.So far in 2020, more than 500 refugees and migrants are known to have died in the Mediterranean sea, and the real number is estimated to be considerably higher.On Wednesday, 45 people – including five children – died when the engine on their boat exploded off Libya, in the country’s deadliest shipwreck this year, the UN said. More than 19,500 migrants have survived the Mediterranean crossing along the central maritime route this year and reached Italy or Malta."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d435bb17d86b71b6a62227005ea1153b160d024/0_218_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df041e4f9a766dbb447d724b9717a5aa","title":"covid lockdowns eased 1m people north west england manchester lancashire yorkshire","story":"Households will be able to mix in parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire More than 1 million people in north-west England will be allowed to mix with other households for the first time in a month after a fall in coronavirus cases.Restrictions on seeing friends and family will be lifted from next week in the Greater Manchester boroughs of Bolton, Stockport and Trafford, as well as Burnley and Hyndburn in Lancashire.People in parts of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees in West Yorkshire will be able to mix with other households from Wednesday, but the measures will remain in place in large parts of Bradford as well as Halifax, Dewsbury and Batley.The move follows a week of intense lobbying of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, by fellow Tory MPs who wanted a more localised approach to the restrictions, while Labour-run councils said such a move would create confusion and ision.The announcement for West Yorkshire means many of the more deprived inner-city communities, where many of the cases have been concentrated, will remain bound by the restrictions imposed on 31 July while more affluent neighbourhoods will not. Labour MPs complained that large parts of the city would remain in the restrictions even though some areas had no recent cases.Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said this week that such an approach was a “recipe for utter confusion, ision and chaos” and would be completely unworkable.He wrote to Hancock on Wednesday, along with the region’s 10 council leaders, to warn against the ward-by-ward approach being suggested by Tory MPs including the Philip Davies in Shipley, Jason McCartney in Colne Valley and Dewsbury’s Mark Eastwood.Hancock said the fall in confirmed cases across the north-west meant the government was “seeing the positive results of our local approach, and are able to bring in increasingly targeted measures”.He added: “It is vital we can maintain this good progress. I have every faith people across the county, especially in areas where we are seeing higher numbers of cases, will continue to play their part by following local rules and self-isolating and requesting a free test as soon as they get any symptoms.”The announcement comes a week after Hancock asked for MPs and councils to work together to reach “the maximum possible local consensus” on where restrictions should be lifted. However, in most cases Tory MPs and Labour councils remain ided.Graham Brady, the Conservative chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, is thought to have asked for part of his constituency, Trafford, to be removed from the measures despite the local council warning it was too early.Andrew Western, the Labour leader of Trafford council, said: “It is apparent that for all of their claims of working in collaboration with local authorities, the government has decided to overrule the council and lift restrictions in Trafford.“This action by government makes a mockery of the claims of locally led decision-making and once again shows that local government is being ignored in spite of being on the frontline of this crisis.”Mike Kane, a Labour MP whose constituency partly covers Trafford, accused the government of “playing politics with people’s health”. He said it was especially irresponsible to announce the lifting of restrictions at the start of a bank holiday weekend.In Oldham, Pendle and Blackburn – which have the highest coronavirus infection rates in England – a ban remains in place on households mixing anywhere. A ban on two households mixing indoors remains in place in Manchester, Salford, Rochdale, Bury, Tameside and Preston."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b54d823d93979d747cf5c50d65a5367bec10475/0_0_5408_3245/master/5408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58a08e1db70c1f5114ed4dbf28224639","title":"europe holiday resorts foreign tourists magaluf staycationers","story":"Typical holiday destinations across Europe are seeing an influx of a new type of visitor: local staycationersIt is usually the domain of hangover-nursing sunbathers and rowdy tourists getting an early start on beach parties. But this year – as quarantines, restrictions and advisories take a toll on travel – the white sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters of Magaluf on the Spanish holiday island of Mallorca have some new visitors: Mallorcans.“This is the first time we’ve ever come – Mallorcans do not come to Magaluf,” laughed Laura, 31, as she settled in for a day on the beach with her friends. “We came this year only because we knew there were no tourists.”It’s a scene playing out across Europe as locals reclaim sites ceded long ago to throngs of tourists. Plazas once filled with the sounds of suitcases rattling over cobblestones now ring with children’s voices, while near-vacant landmarks offer locals an intimate experience of the top sights in their backyards.Earlier this year Mallorcans began quietly spreading word of a nearly deserted, picture-perfect beach, resulting in a stream of locals traipsing out to Magaluf.“I would have never brought my daughter here before,” Consuelo Merchante told the news website Ultima Hora. It was her first time visiting Magaluf’s beach in four decades. “We stayed away because of the British tourists,” she said.The novelty of being a hometown tourist, however, comes at a steep cost. In Magaluf and across tourist sites in Europe, the backdrop is one of shuttered shops and hotels, hinting at the devastating economic impact of the plunge in tourists.“It’s bittersweet,” said Vesna Celebic, a tour guide in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. In recent years locals had resigned themselves to sharing the walled old town with millions of visitors, enduring the relentless arrivals of mammoth cruise ships and the clatter of helicopter tours overhead.Then the pandemic brought these drawbacks into sharp relief. “At the moment it’s wonderful,” she said. “The old town is definitely the place that the locals reclaimed. Now you see a lot of kids riding bikes and playing soccer in some of the public squares, you hear the locals again. You hear the local language.”Still, the dire reality facing the tourism-dependent city was unescapable. Celebic had just wrapped up her fifth tour of the season, when normally she would have racked up 100 or so at this point. “The things is, there is this economic disaster looming upon us,” she said.In Italy, cities and beaches usually thronged with foreign tourists have become a draw for Italians. Locals have flocked to the Riviera Romagnola, a stretch of golden beaches overlooking the Adriatic sea.“With the advent of low-cost flights to foreign destinations, young Italians had preferred to spend their holidays in Spain or Greece,” the deputy mayor of Rimini, Gloria Lisi, told the .But the pandemic appears to have reversed this flow, with the riviera now playing host to a crop of first-time visitors. “This summer, Rimini is crowded with people in their 20s who come from neighbouring regions. This hasn’t happened for decades.”The chance to take in some of the world’s best art without elbowing through crowds has been a draw for some. “Morning at the Louvre to take advantage of the lack of tourists,” author Mira Kamdar wrote on Twitter last week. “Paris as we Parisians rarely get to experience it.”In Barcelona, which before the pandemic was receiving an average of 155,000 visitors a day, arrivals have slowed to a trickle. “Tourism had been pushing out residents, in some ways,” said Arlene Bayliss, a marketing professional based in the city. “Now it’s the reverse: it’s tourists that get lost among the locals.”She is now seeing the city in a new light, marvelling at the ability to snap photos alone on the steps of the city’s cathedral, or use the time she had once spent navigating a sea of tourists to focus on the city’s stunning architecture.The lack of visitors, coupled with the departure of city residents on August vacations, has emptied the usual tourist haunts such as the Gothic quarter. “You can wander through and there’s not a soul,” she said. “Then you come across a plaza filled with locals and kids playing. It’s very different.”The situation has demonstrated what is at stake for cities and other hotspots in striking a balance between attracting tourists and catering for local residents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cc0858423c884ca564a624b05aa079d4daab6d4/234_68_1686_1012/master/1686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bafd424f2e4267b8089167b97c0c2425","title":"far right activists filmed hassling asylum seekers in hotels","story":"One video shows members of Britain First entering hotel and banging on bedroom doorsAnger is mounting over a series of videos posted by far-right organisations in which activists enter hotels where asylum seekers are being held, knock on their doors to interrogate them and accuse them of wasting taxpayers’ money.A video by Britain First, circulated widely on social media, shows a group of far-right activists entering a hotel in Bromsgrove, near Birmingham, and banging on bedroom doors, demanding to know what country the asylum seekers are from.The Britain First members say in the video they have entered legally and that the hotel is housing illegal immigrants.The asylum seekers appear not to understand who the far-right activists are. Most who are interrogated answer, perhaps believing the Britain First activists to be officials. Many of the asylum seekers could be at risk if their faces are shown on camera.Campaigners from the group Status Now have raised concerns about the video and have complained to the Home Office and the accommodation provider Serco about the incident.Claudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, condemned the incident. “The attacks on asylum seekers at this hotel are disgraceful and I stand in full solidarity with all those who are exercising their legal right to claim asylum,” she said. “Britain First and other hate groups represent the very worst of our country. They must not be given any platform to legitimise their vile anti-migrant discourse.”Other similar videos are circulating on YouTube from far-right organisations, including one that shows asylum seekers being harassed outside their hotel in Newcastle.Far-right organisations are also circulating on social media lists of hotels where asylum seekers are being accommodated.One hotel on the list is Home Office accommodation in Wakefield where living conditions have been heavily criticised. The far-right list wrongly refers to it as an “Urban House Detection Centre”.A spokesperson for West Mercia police said of the Bromsgrove incident: “Officers were called to a report of a group of people who had gained access to the Bromsgrove hotel at just after 7.30pm on Thursday 20 August. The iniduals had left the premises prior to police arrival and no criminal offences have been reported.”Jenni Halliday, Serco’s contract director for asylum accommodation and support, said: “Serco was shocked and appalled at this racist attack on a hotel where we are accommodating asylum seekers.“At the same time, we are very proud of the swift response of our employees who were on duty at the hotel. They dialled 999 to summon the police who arrived quickly and, in the meantime, took every measure possible to protect the residents and themselves in the face of an aggressive group of men who forced their way in through a fire door.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We take the wellbeing of asylum seekers extremely seriously.

Failure to provide details risks a fine of up to £100.Border Force officers “will use the QR code at the top of the document to check you have completed the form successfully”, the government says. Information including the passenger’s UK address and travel details is used to check that iniduals are self-isolating if necessary or to warn them if they have come into contact with travellers with Covid-19.Home Office figures published this week show 1.3 million passengers arrived in the UK by air in July.It is understood that the checks need to be made manually by Border Force officials, with no automated system of logging passenger locator form details when passports are scanned. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: “Passenger locator forms are a crucial part of a functioning test, track and isolate system. These are deeply worrying findings, amounting to yet another example of failing to implement effective protective measures at UK borders. This issue needs to be addressed urgently for the sake of public health and to reassure travellers.”More than half of the 136 people who responded to a  callout about arrivals to the UK said their passenger locator forms had not been checked. Peter de Groot, 72, who flew into London’s Heathrow airport from Kenya this month, described the monitoring in the airport as “a scandal”.“When I got there they seemed really disinterested. There was far more security getting into a Kenyan supermarket,” he said. “Nobody checked I filled in the form I felt it was quite disgraceful. There was a digital thermometer sat on a desk, but no one there to man it. It seemed like the government were expecting the airlines to do their work for them. It’s pathetic.”Colin Beesely, a secondary school assistant principal who lives in Stratford-upon-Avon, said he was shocked at the difference in measures when he arrived at Stansted from Spain in the first week of August.“When we arrived in Spain, our QR code was scanned by two police officers and we were led into a foyer where our temperature was taken. Only then were we permitted to leave the terminal,” Beesely, 60, said. “When we got to Stansted, there was nothing, we just walked out. We were really angry because you’re either doing this seriously or not. The absolute lack of people to check documentation upon our arrival speaks volumes.”Many reported failings onboard ferries and trains. A 45-year-old man from Essex said he had not been aware that he had to complete a form until he boarded his ferry home from a holiday in France, but he was not stopped or asked for further details.Only three fixed-penalty notices were handed out by police to people who failed to self-isolate after arriving in England and Wales between 15 June and 17 August, according to figures published by the National Police Chiefs’ Council on Thursday. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Passengers do not to need to hand a passenger locator form to a Border Force officer on arrival, the form is completed and submitted online.“Border Force continues to operate a spot-check regime so passengers may be asked to show proof they have completed the form to an officer. We are seeing a high level of compliance and we expect this to continue as everyone plays their part to help stop the spread of this disease.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59751834340e0c7330cf844ffc47edd63452124f/0_26_3350_2011/master/3350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4e865d8a0b93fab6104ecd0ab1159c3","title":"worlds oldest couple guinness record ecuador","story":"Julio Mora, 110, and Waldramina Quinteros, 104, a combined nearly 215 years, received Guinness certification in mid-AugustJulio Mora slipped away from his parents to secretly marry Waldramina Quinteros one February day.

Ten years later, she’s still learningOne day, back in 2011, I was on the train going into central London, when a big group of 14-year-old girls ran up to me, like a gang of giggling meerkats, shouting, “Are you – are you CAITLIN MORAN? You wrote How To Be A Woman? Oh, my God! We learned about masturbation from that! Dude, it’s amazing! We’ve all started doing it now! We’ve formed a gang! At school! It’s called wank club! And we come in every morning and say how many times we did it last night – and then high five each other! In the playground! Shouting Wank Club! Can we shake your hand?”“Well, if your wrists aren’t already too tired – then, yes,” I said.As the girls got off at the next stop, my two daughters, then 10 and eight, were silent for a moment, then said, “Mum, what’s wanking?”“A very pleasant and constructive hobby for a young lady, which I totally recommend,” I said. “And which is much cheaper and more accessible than inline skating. Now do your shoelaces up. We’re at Euston.”Of course now, almost 10 years later, in 2020, women masturbating is old news. In many ways, I don’t know why I’ve opened with it. Peak lady wank was probably way back in 2016, when Fleabag essentially reworked the intent of the slogan “Yes we can” while watching videos of Barack Obama. There’s barely a prominent female figure who hasn’t cheerfully mentioned her happy rummaging: Chrissy Teigen, Emma Watson, Rihanna, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anna Kendrick and Jane Fonda have all knocked out a quote about knocking one out. We’ve had Lena Dunham’s Girls showing Jemima Kirke and Adam Driver doing it together on a sofa, and Michaela Coel’s Tracey in Chewing Gum having a fiddle while pretending to be Beyoncé. If there is such a thing as a lady wank bank, it’s pretty solvent right now.But in 2011, talking about female masturbation was so novel that I was asked on to BBC Newsnight – Newsnight! – to discuss it, although the conversation, bizarrely, pivoted into wondering whether there might be such a thing as “clown porn”. Jeremy Paxman’s face became deeply unhappy around that point. As he disbelievingly repeated the words “clown porn” he looked like a posh horse that wanted to gallop away over some hills for ever.In the decade since writing that book, the world has come to look very different. Now, happily, feminism makes constant, worldwide news. Beyoncé makes albums that feature Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie explaining what a feminist is. Dior does shows with the word “FEMINIST” emblazoned over the catwalk. Topshop sells “This is what a feminist looks like” T-shirts. #timesup, #MeToo, the Bechdel test, emotional labour, slut-shaming, free-bleeding, the pay gap, gaslighting, intersectionality, trans rights – it’s a fertile age for feminist consciousness-raising and lexical expansion. Whatever aspect of feminism you are most interested in, you can go online and find thousands, if not millions, of others who feel just like you.Social media has reminded us of the most intriguing yet exhilarating fact about feminism: there is no feminist bible. Feminism isn’t a science. It’s just an idea a completely freelance, voluntary, crowd-sourced and brilliant idea, in which women and, yes, sometimes men, go about identifying, then trying to solve the problems of girls and women. And, one of the things I feel we sometimes forget , celebrating their brilliance. Although it might occasionally feel like it, being a woman isn’t just a set of difficult questions. The female population of the Earth is also a set of answers. It’s a billion seeds of potential. It is a field of blossom, just waiting.In many happy ways, much of what I wrote about in How To Be A Woman is dated. Flat shoes are now so widespread and stylish that the chapter on heels seems unnecessary eating disorders are commonly discussed abortion rights might, particularly in the US, be represented as something that must be continually fought for – but women are far more open about their histories than they were back in 2011, when it was almost always framed as a terrible secret. We’ve had fashion spreads that feature pubic and underarm hair menstruation is recognised to the point where we can campaign against period poverty and the #childfree movement increasingly normalises women’s choice not to have children.Once every few years, as an act of self-lacerating nostalgia for my younger self, I reread How To Be A Woman and marvel not over what I got right, but what I got wrong. I was in my early 30s, had two small kids, and was convinced that, in a small way, I knew everything. I figured that the most difficult part of parenting was over after all, I’d had two human beings bobsled out of my vagina. It couldn’t get worse, right? Hahaha – oh, how I underestimated the teenage years. Potty training is a mere bagatelle compared to negotiating a 15-year-old accusing you of “slut-shaming” her when you suggest a backless dress might not work for school and that she should, perhaps, consider a cardie, instead. And if your family has to help a child with a serious illness – in our case, a four-year eating disorder – it is something that will, over and over, have you absolutely on your knees, believing this might not be something you can deal with, after all. That, despite all your feminism, you are useless to your daughters. Back then, before I’d experienced true terror, I had dozens of beliefs I thought were vital moral imperatives. For instance, I was convinced that it was profoundly unfeminist to get Botox: “It makes you look weak and scared,” I wrote then, little realising that, by the time you hit 45, it’s the fact that you do look weak and scared, and also permanently semi-traumatised, that makes you start to consider it. When I tried it for the first time, after the worst year of my life had left me looking like a deflated, heartbroken Gruffalo, it was only after I’d written a 3,000-word essay about it in my head, in order to silence an imaginary Feminist Botox Police – of which, ironically, I was a key member. If I had to, I could make an entertainingly spurious, yet secretly heartfelt, argument for Botox being a pro-feminist invention. After all, at £200 for six months of effectiveness, it’s wildly cheaper than the month-long holiday you’d need to get a similar “face vibe”, which I believe is the technical term and for me, it’s had the pleasant side-effect of stopping me grinding my teeth in my sleep. I will have molars in my 60s after all! Double result! The main mistake I made when I was 35 was to foolishly presume that, once you got past, say, 40, life for women becomes a glorious time of supreme elegance and relaxation. Given that all the difficult constructions of “discovering who I was”, had been done, I was convinced that, come 2020, I would be devoting all the rest of my life to work, enjoying my carefully curated capsule wardrobe (four blouses and three pairs of jeans that didn’t give me camel toe maybe, also, a jaunty hat), possibly learning Welsh, and The Continuing Struggle. I thought middle age was the easy bit. The good bit. The bit where you finally got to truly enjoy your womanhood.What I didn’t realise is that, in middle age, the reason women don’t worry about “who they are” any more is because they don’t have time. Middle age is not your elegant fun time. A middle-aged woman’s problems, she soon learns, are other people’s problems, and they are far harder than your own. By the age of 40, chances are, you will have become a fifth emergency service: friends’ marriages are imploding your parents are becoming ill, or dying your children’s teenage years are when they truly need you to be around as much as possible. You have a marriage to keep alive, two careers in the household to maintain, a pile of stuff at the bottom of the stairs that no one else seems to realise NEEDS TO BE TAKEN UPSTAIRS, and the slow realisation that your life really isn’t turning out how you’d always presumed it would.You enter a profound stage of mourning, and yet, notably, we tend not to have any stories about this time in a woman’s life. There is nothing you can template on. We are overrun with sexy lady scientists and kung-fu ninja superheroes, and adorable hot messes who triumph in the end. But there are no blockbuster movies about women with bad backs trying to remain in love with the same person for decades there are no uplifting party songs about greying iniduals nailing the definitively fair and effective housework roster pinned up on the wall, and enlivened by a series of top-quality humorous cartoons and jokes. Wiping bums, mending hearts, putting food on the table, keeping people alive, helping them die, and making sad people laugh never get the eulogies they deserve. You’re just seen as … a bit of a drudge. To be a capable, middle-aged woman, essentially holding society together in the unpaid care you give to those around you is still, in this century, an invisible task – despite this vital work being valued, worldwide, at more than $10tn a year. $10 trillion! Only the economies of China, the EU and the US rival that. Women are, by their numbers and labour, an unpaid continent, who give their labour away for free because … we just always have. There has never been a point where our work has been re-evaluated for the role it plays in holding up every country’s economy and, frankly, soul. As a culture, we revere attributes such as “entrepreneurship,” and “leadership” but we do not value the things women tend to have specialised in by the time they reach middle age: care and love.If feminism has, demonstrably, used the last 10 years to make women feel happy talking about masturbation – self-love – then it seems wholly possible we could spend the next 10 years talking about this other love, in which we are so very excellent and well-versed but, as yet, unrewarded for. If I were magic, andor had more time, I would form the Womens’ Union – a union that would lobby to recognise the home as a workplace, throw the doors open wide on the millions of homes across the world and show what really goes on inside: everything that really matters.What are the key changes since I wrote How To Be A Woman? Mainly, they are incredibly positive: when I see what my teenage daughters are listening to, reading or watching, whether it’s Michaela Coel in I May Destroy You staring at a menstrual blood clot on her bed, Lizzo singing about body positivity, the Broad City girls hustling for their dollar in NYC, Jameela Jamil showing off her stretch marks, Janelle Monae singing about bisexuality, or Queenie hitting the clubs, living her best life and surviving the asshats, I think, with great satisfaction, how this is the the best era for joyous, mainstream feminist role models young women have ever had. In 1985, I had the choice of Margaret Thatcher or Miss Piggy. Back then, young women really had to make do.The only thing I would do, as someone who is now officially an Old Crone – these are my Hag Years, and I am proud of them – is caution all these amazing, strident young maids: don’t eat your sisters. While feminism’s online call-out culture stems from good intentions – to accelerate progress, to hold people to account – it is noticeable that there is barely a feminist of the last 10 years, whether it be a pop star, comedian, academic, businesswoman, politician or activist, who hasn’t, at some point, been brutally hauled across the social media coals for getting an aspect of feminism “wrong”.These days, there is hypervigilance around talking about being a woman that makes “being a woman” feel like something a bit effortful, and perilous, and something you could publicly fail at – which is a miserable climate to be young in. One enduring aspect of being young is believing in moral absolutism. We’ve all done it: I remember thinking I would never be friends with someone who preferred the Stone Roses over Happy Mondays. But this is, undeniably, a far more inflexible and judgmental era than when I was a teenager, or young woman.So many young feminists I meet are in such a state of anxiety about accidentally saying the “wrong” thing – so terrified of making a mistake on social media, despite wanting, desperately, to be kind and good – that they would prefer to remain silent on various subjects. This puts the future of feminism in a risky position because online activism is, like love and care, unpaid work. And when women shame each other for free, for months on end, the patriarchy simply sits back smoking a big cigar, touching its genitals, and murmuring, “Yes, ladies, yes, keep fighting. Could some of you – the younger, sexier ones – maybe put on a bikini? And do it in this pool of jelly?”From my 45-year-old Witch Throne, where I have seen feminism ebb, flow and ebb again, I feel I should croakingly remind everyone, once more, about the most crucial, brilliant, sometimes frustrating thing about feminism: it’s really not a science. It has no rules. It’s still just an idea, created by millions, over centuries, and it can only survive if the next generation feels able to kick ideas around, ask questions, make mistakes and reinvent the concept over and over, so we can build the next wave of feminism. And the next. And the next.Feminism is at its best when it looks like freedom. When it remembers that you must never underestimate the importance of progress looking like it could, among other things, be fun. When it’s the place where women can feel relaxed, and hopeful in their bones. When they feel so connected with each other that, sometimes, they can go up to strangers on a train at 10am on a Tuesday, happily shouting about how they have just discovered another new, brilliant thing about being a woman. • More Than A Woman by Caitlin Moran (Ebury Publishing, £20) is published on 3 September.

The health authorities aim to reach 1m tests a week by the end of September.Santé Publique France reported that “the dynamic of transmission is growing strongly and is very worrying”. There has been an increase in the number of infected people showing Covid-19 symptoms – as opposed to half being asymptomatic, as was reported the previous week. While all age groups are reportedly affected, the authorities say there is a continuing increase in cases among young adults, many of whom show no symptoms.The rise comes at the end of the long summer holidays and just before la rentrée, the return to work and school across France next week. All pupils are expected back at school on Tuesday or Wednesday, wearing masks if they are over 11 years old. All school and college staff must wear masks.It is now obligatory to wear masks in outside public spaces in Paris and three city suburbs as well as Marseilles and Strasbourg.

Follow all the updates liveIn Berlin, police, who deployed 3,000 officers to control crowds at a march expected to reach 20,000, have prepared for possible violence as activists opposed to the virus measures urge social media followers across Europe to arm themselves and gather. Activists, angered by Berlin’s decision to ban protests after demonstrators at a recent rally failed to wear masks or keep their distance, flooded the city with thousands of applications for additional protest rallies this weekend. “The gatherings planned by several initiatives for August 29 against the corona policy of the federal and state governments can take place,” the court ruled. Responding to the ruling, Berlin’s interior minister, Andreas Geisel, said the court had given protesters a second chance to show they could comply with distancing measures. “I appeal to everyone to gather in Berlin without violence,” he said. In England, the government published guidance for schools on what to do if there is a coronavirus outbreak.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, branded the timing of the new guidance “reprehensible”. He said: “It was obvious weeks ago that lockdown advice was necessary. The government’s decision to publish this at 9pm on the Friday of the bank holiday weekend before most schools are due to return is nothing short of reprehensible and demonstrates a complete lack of regard for the wellbeing of school leaders and their teams. “The decision confirms the government simply does not understand the commitment and professionalism of school leaders who will feel compelled act immediately.Thousands of coronavirus sceptics are set to descend on Berlin on Saturday for a mass protest against pandemic restrictions.Police said they woud turn out in force and strictly monitor compliance with mask-wearing and social distancing, with the Berlin police chief, Barbara Slowik, warning that if the demonstrators did not adhere to virus safety rules, police would clear the area “very quickly”.“We will not be able or willing to watch tens of thousands assemble and create infection risks,” she added.Berlin city authorities had previously decided not to allow the Saturday demonstration to go ahead, fearing that the estimated 22,000 protesters would not keep a distance of 1.5 metres (five feet) apart or comply with face mask requirements.The ban sparked outrage from organisers and their supporters who flooded social media with angry messages vowing to protest anyway, with some even calling for violence.But on the eve of the demo, Berlin’s administrative court sided with the demonstrators, saying there was no indication that organisers would “deliberately ignore” social distancing rules and endanger public health.Hello everyone.

Thanks so much in advance.Azerbaijan has extended some coronavirus lockdown restrictions, including the closure of its borders, until 31 Sept after a further rise in the number of infections, the government said on Saturday. Azerbaijan, which recorded a daily increase of coronavirus cases of between 130 and 180 in the past several weeks, will reopen museums and exhibition halls from 1 September, the government said. But shopping malls will remain closed and public transport will be limited, while the ban on travelling between the regions remains in place, the government said. Azerbaijan introduced measures to stem the coronavirus on 24 March and has extended them several times. The South Caucasus country of about 10 million people had registered 35,986 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 527 deaths as of Saturday. Confusion over lockdown guidelines is being used by some as an “excuse” to break the rules in England, a police chief has said. Andy Rhodes, the chief constable of Lancashire Constabulary, said there was a “world of difference” between people acting sensibly and others who were “flagrantly” ignoring the rules. “What we’re looking at here is being proportionate, so if we think that people have thought about it and they are confused, we turn up and deal with the situation,” he told BBC Breakfast on Saturday. “The vast majority of times across the country the police are just giving advice out and asking people to do things differently. “(But) we’ve had people who have clearly, flagrantly, ignored the rules and had a wedding for 200 people. “There’s no one anywhere who could misinterpret the current rules to say that 200 people in your back garden or in your house or in an area is going to be OK. “There’s a world of difference between good people who are doing their best to enjoy themselves and they’re a bit confused, and people that are clearly just ignoring the normal rules that the rest of us are trying to abide by. “Being confused is becoming a bit of an excuse for some people at the moment.” His remarks came as the home secretary, Priti Patel, promised a crackdown on illegal raves in the UK, with fines of up to 10,000 for organisers. Rhodes said that changing restrictions would “inevitably” lead to confusion, but rule-breakers risked taking away some “freedoms” that have begun to return. He urged people to be sensible and “get the best” out of alternative social activities. “Given it’s the bank holiday weekend, what we’re saying to people is be sensible, respect the work that some of the people have put into trying to arrange events sensibly, if they’re online, et cetera,” he said.In the UK, decisions on easing or tightening local coronavirus lockdown restrictions should not be “imposed” by the government, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, has said. The Labour former cabinet minister called for more negotiation and agreement between Westminster and local authorities on such issues. His comments came after the government moved to ease lockdown measures in some parts of the north-west from next week. Burnham told BBC Breakfast: “I think we will better negotiate what lies ahead of us in the autumn and winter if the government listens to local leaders - they know their communities. “It wasn’t just in Greater Manchester where they overruled us. In Bradford, basically communities were split there - some are still under restrictions, some not. “You then have the situation where some people on one half of the street are under restrictions and others not. “My main message to the government is you must not impose these things from London when you are going to affect communities in this way, it must be by negotiation and agreement. “And that needs to be a core principle that we agree on before we go any further into the rest of what will be a very difficult year.” Burnham said communities should be “worried” about the way decisions were being taken. “Imposition of decisions like this without agreement or negotiation is absolutely the wrong way to go. In the UK, Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood said “draconian action” could be needed if the public did not stick to physical distancing rules, hinting the government could take stronger action than local lockdowns. He told Times Radio: “It’s an enduring emergency and until a vaccine turns up there is a national resolve, there is a responsibility, a duty of every inidual ... also the government needs to keep the nation safe and that’s where Matt Hancock’s work comes in and then Rishi Sunak needs to make sure the economy is working. “If the nation, if iniduals aren’t following the rules then ultimately ... we cannot break the chain of spread and therefore draconian action is required to take place. “We’d prefer it to be local but absolutely, if that R-rating does go too high, this is a warning for every single listener: ensure that you do socially distance so we can actually contain it. “This is an enduring emergency, I repeat. Until there’s a vaccine this is the new normal that we’ve got to get used to.”Namibia will lift lockdown restrictions, allowing international travel, schools to reopen and onsite alcohol consumption from September, the president, Hage Geingob, announced Friday, but he extended an overnight curfew as Covid-19 cases continue to rise. The southern African country of 2 million now has 6,906 confirmed Covid-19 cases and the disease is not yet contained - of its 65 deaths, 55 were in August alone. But as with other southern African nations, leaders are weighing the impact of the virus against the huge economic and social damage done by lockdowns. “The virus is likely to remain in our midst for a prolonged time and we must learn to live with it ... learning to live with the virus means adapting our attitudes and behaviours so that we can reduce the damage it can do to our country,” Geingob said in a televised address. He announced an 8pm to 5am curfew in place in the capital, Windhoek, and the Erongo region – Covid-19 hotspots – will be introduced across the country. But Hosea Kutako international airport will open its doors to international travellers from Tuesday, while schools, vocational education training providers and universities will be allowed to hold onsite classes from 7 September. Restaurants and hotels outside worst-affected Windhoek and the Erongo region can start selling meals and alcohol to be consumed on the premises, the president announced. In England, nationwide restrictions cannot be ruled out should there be a rise in coronavirus cases this winter, the health secretary said.Matt Hancock also hinted that restrictions may not be eased over Christmas to avoid an “uptick” in the number of Covid-19 cases.Speaking to the Times, Hancock said countries in other parts of the world were already experiencing a second wave, adding it was “a very serious threat”.But he said the UK was managing to keep the number of new cases “flat” through the test and trace system and local lockdowns.Describing the worst-case scenario, he said the UK could be battling bad flu and growth in coronavirus as people spend more time indoors.He continued: “Cases go up again, and we have to use very extensive local lockdowns or take further national action. We don’t rule that out, but we don’t want to see it.”BBC’s Newsnight reported that a “reasonable worst-case planning assumption” presented to the government warned there could be up to 81,000 excess deaths directly attributed to Covid-19 between July and next March.The broadcaster said the scenario was laid out in a document signed off by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for the Cabinet Office at the end of July.France reported a jump of 7,379 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours according to the Public Health France figures released on Friday evening. This is the highest figure for new cases since 31 March. A historic check of the government’s Covid-19 website suggests it is the second-highest since the figures began to be reported by the health authorities on 2 March. In England, secondary schools in areas with large rises in Covid-19 cases could be put on a rota system limiting the number of pupils attending.On Friday night, just days before millions of pupils go back to school, the government issued new guidance. The education secretary said the changes are an “absolute last resort”.He said it was all very late and it was, “hugely frustrating to be on the back foot”.Hello everyone, I am taking over the ’s live feed.

lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"eat help loophole meant diners could save 180 meals","story":"An Eat out to Help Out loophole meant diners could save up to £180 off meals, the  has discovered, as the Treasury admitted it is powerless to stop gaming of scheme.People eating out under the scheme were able to cheat their way to bigger discounts by asking to pay for each course separately, and claim a discount of up to £10 per person for each.This means that a table of six could have saved up to £180 if they each claimed the full discount for a three course meal.The scheme gave diners up to £10 off food and soft drinks on Mondays to Wednesdays throughout August and ends on Monday.Several restaurants told this newspaper that they had been asked to process bills for each course separately by customers, although most said they had declined to do so.A Treasury source said there was nothing in the rules of the scheme to prevent such gaming of the system and the trade body UK Hospitality said it was aware of diners using the loophole to boost their savings. A Treasury spokesman urged the public to “respect the spirit” of the scheme.The emergence of such a loophole will fuel fears that the cost of the offer could be over-inflated. Figures released earlier this week revealed that, as of August 23, the total amount claimed for was £336m.John O\u0027Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers\u0027 Alliance, said:  This scheme is in danger of egregiously eating into taxpayers\u0027 pockets.  “While action was needed to reopen the restaurant sector, subsidies like this produce unintended consequences by distorting spending decisions and quickly running up big bills which taxpayers will eventually have to pay off.“Instead of meddling in our meals, ministers should stay away from these schemes in the future.”Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: “Asking to be billed separately for inidual courses is not against the system. Businesses can claim back the money anyway, so, in theory, everybody benefits if the discount is applied that way. “It might cause administrative headaches for some businesses, though. So, it is a good idea if customers talk to the business, ideally when they make their booking, to explain that’s how they want to be billed.”Another loophole identified by the  was when diners craftily chose to eat a different course at multiple venues throughout the night, therefore saving far more money had they stayed in one place and met the £10 cap.Another pub in central London witnessed customers coming to take advantage of bar snacks and starters before heading to have meals in the West End. The landlord told The  that one such reveller had a cheap seven-course lunch by taking advantage of this method.A spokesman for the Treasury said: “The Eat out to Help out scheme is designed to protect jobs and the figures indicate it is working – with over 64 million meals claimed for since it launched.“We encourage people to respect the spirit of the scheme.”Ms Nicholls said it had been a “great success” and pointed out that many restaurants are planning to continue with it voluntarily into September, without the support of the Government.However, she warned that most would be too “financially vulnerable” after months of lockdown to continue offering discounts.She said a formal extension would “keep customers excited about going out and give businesses the support they still need”.Among the restaurants which are voluntarily extending the scheme are the Gilbert Scott and Aqua Shard in London, Perdu Perdu in Manchester and New Chapter in Edinburgh. Oakman Inns will also extend its discounts.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"falkland islands unique history has left rich valuable carbon","story":"Vast peatlands could provide up to £47 million worth of carbon offsets every year for the Falkland Islands if they are restored, a new study has suggested. When European explorers arrived at the Falklands in the late 18th century, they found an almost untouched scrubby landscape, home to colonies of sea lions, birds, and little else.It may not have looked like much. But without human and mammal intervention to disturb the land, and with the addition of the fertilising effect from the droppings of native animals, the islands had developed into possibly the most peat-rich place in the world. Around 40 per cent of the Falklands are peatlands, according to Professor Chris Evans of the UK Centre for Hydrology and Ecology, compared to 12 per cent of the UK. Restoring them could prove to be a valuable income stream, as well as improving local bioersity and potentially putting the islands on a path to negative emissions, making them a world leader in climate change mitigation. Peatlands are one of the most carbon intensive landscapes in the world, storing more carbon per hectare than a tropical rainforest. But peatlands that have been degraded can become a source of greenhouse gas emissions. Peatland around the world currently emits 3 million tonnes of CO2e a year, but has the potential to sequester 14 million tonnes of CO2e annually. The introduction of agricultural livestock by settlers and 250 years of subsequent grazing and burning has depleted the Falklands’ vast stocks of peat. Native tussac grasses, which are vital for peat formation, were displaced. These impacts mean that the islands’ capacity to continue forming peat and sequester carbon has decreased, as has the habitat for globally important wildlife, including penguins, albatrosses and sea lions, for which the Islands are famous, said Mr Evans. Restoring them could save up to 1 million tons of CO2 a year, according to a new study from UKCEH.   It could also prove valuable to the local community, as restoration projects could be sold as offsets to companies keen to reach their goals of net zero emissions in the next ten to 30 years. The researchers say the restored peatlands could be worth up to £47m a year to farmers and landowners, based on the UK government’s estimates for the future value of carbon offsets. “With its small population and vast peatland areas, the Falklands have the potential to become one of the world’s first ‘carbon negative’ societies by managing their natural landscapes to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. said Mr Evans. Restoring the peatland would require changing agricultural practices, and reintroducing the native tussac species of grassland, and would require the support of local farmers.You\u0027ve got this carbon rich resource, Mr Evans said, and hopefully there\u0027s opportunities there to hopefully bring in additional income to the farmers there in a different way.It could also improve the habitat for the Islands’ penguins, albatrosses and sea lions. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"military dog receives animal equivalent vc tackling al qaeda","story":"A military dog is to receive the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross for tackling al-Qaeda insurgents in Afghanistan as part of a special forces raid.Kuno, a three-year-old Belgian Malinois, was wounded in action during the battle in 2019 whilst serving with the Special Boat Service. He is to be awarded the Dickin Medal later this year. Pinned down by grenade and machine-gun fire during a compound assault, the elite troops were unable to move without taking casualties.Without hesitation, Kuno charged through a hail of gunfire to tackle the gunman, breaking the deadlock and changing the course of the attack, allowing the mission to be completed successfully.During the assault Kuno was wounded by bullets in both back legs. He was given life-saving treatment by his handler and by medics in the back of a helicopter.His injuries were so severe he required several operations before he was stable enough to fly back to the UK. Part of one of Kuno’s rear paws had to be amputated to prevent life-threatening infection. Kuno returned home on an RAF plane, receiving in-flight care from a Royal Army Veterinary Corps team. He was transferred to the Defence Animal Training Regiment in Melton Mowbray, Leics, where he underwent extensive reconstructive surgery, overseen by Professor Dick White, one of the world’s leading specialists in canine surgery.He has become the first UK military working dog to be fitted with custom made prosthetic limbs.Kuno, who was on his second deployment when he was injured, is the first UK military dog to be fitted with such devices. Lightweight and fully bespoke, they enable him to run and jump as he wishes. He is said to be thriving in his new home in the west country.Colonel Neil Smith, the Chief Veterinary and Remount Officer, said: “It is important that Military Working Dogs receive a high level of care if they are unfortunately injured, and Defence has military vets and vet nurses to ensure animals receive the care and rehabilitation they deserve”.The Peoples Dispensary for Sick Animals (now known as PDSA) opened its first hospital in 1917. Since then it has treated millions of sick animals in the UK.The Dickin Medal was introduced by PDSA’s founder, Maria Dickin, in 1943. It is recognised as the highest award any animal can achieve while serving in military conflict. Kuno will become the 72nd recipient of the PDSA Dickin Medal. Previous recipients include 34 dogs, 32 Second World War messenger pigeons, four horses and one cat.The PDSA Dickin Medal is a large, bronze medallion bearing the words “For Gallantry” and “We Also Serve” all within a laurel wreath. The ribbon is striped green, dark brown and sky blue representing water, earth and air to symbolise the naval, land and air forces.British special forces are still active in Afghanistan, partnering local forces in the fight against remnants of al-Qaeda.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Without Kuno, the course of this operation could have been very different, and it’s clear he saved the lives of British personnel that day. This particular raid was one of the most significant achievements against al-Qaeda in several years.“Kuno’s story reminds us not only of the dedicated service of our soldiers and military dogs, but also the great care that the UK Armed Forces provide to the animals that serve alongside them.”Former Royal Marine dog handlers injured during their service have set up a dog hydrotherapy treatment centre to rehabilitate animals. Pawseidon, based in Poole, Dorset, treats injured dogs in a five by four metre pool or a treadmill in a water tank. They say the warm water and slight current that can be generated by submerged jets is ideal for helping injured animals or those recovering from surgery.The canine therapists sometimes play classical music and reggae during sessions as they found the sound can have a noticeable calming effect on some dogs.When the  recently visited Pawseidon Nicky Stazey, from Poole, had brought her four-year old Great Dane weighing 90kg to the centre for treatment on inflamed joints. She said treatment in the pool to build up muscle tissue had clearly alleviated Thor’s suffering.“When I first brought him he was literally hiding behind me,” she said. “But he’s come on leaps and bounds. His confidence is through the roof at times…he’s fantastic.”James Hill, 38, was shot multiple times in December 2013 during an operation in Afghanistan which left him with arthritis in his hip and a lower leg injury. He lost his military working dog, in the same action and eventually had to leave the Royal Marines due to his injuries having endured 16 operations.He said: “Seeing dogs hurt now and seeing what we can do with the properties and power of water, it’s unbelievable.“What we do now is a bit pink and fluffy, but it’s all about having a passion for animals and the satisfaction of helping dogs.“There’s a communication you have with animals through therapy and helping them and you can see that they really benefit from that and warm up to you.“Even in pain dogs will stay loyal to their owners. They are stoic in their whole recovery journey and I really admire that.“Dogs are great at reading our emotions and acting on them to comfort their owners, which in turn helps owners overcome that battle back to fitness.”As James observed: “There are other ways to skin a cat”.In 2019, Kuno deployed as a Canine Protection and Detection dog in direct support of specialist UK and host nation forces. Operating in mountainous, unforgiving and dangerous areas, Kuno had conducted 16 operations over a 5-month period. He was a pivotal member of the team and always held on high alert. His role was to detect explosives, find hidden weapons and incapacitate the enemy if so ordered. Where he led, the team were happy to follow, safe in the knowledge that he had cleared the route.In May 2019, Kuno deployed on an operation. The enemy was expected to be well armed, well prepared and willing to fight to the death. Kuno and his handler were among the first off, the helicopter. As they raced across the open ground towards the compound, they immediately came under a burst of machine gun fire. Miraculously, no one was injured. The assault team entered the compound, where Kuno was released to incapacitate an insurgent. He did so successfully, and then switched focus to detection, soon discovering a variety of hidden weapons and explosives in the compound. Kuno returned to his handler and the team continued their mission, moving towards another set of buildings. Suddenly, several grenades detonated in close proximity to the team and a burst of machinegun fire came through a doorway adjacent to the force. Another enemy insurgent, equipped with a Night Vision equipment, had concealed himself in a compound courtyard and was shooting at the assault force as they approached. Pinned down by accurate fire, the assault force was unable to move without sustaining casualties. Kuno’s handler, confident in the dog’s ability, relied on him to break the deadlock. Kuno did not hesitate and raced through the doorway to attack the insurgent. Surprised by the speed and aggression of Kuno’s assault, the insurgent fired wildly into the darkness at the shape bounding towards him.  Unfortunately, several rounds found their mark, and Kuno received bullet wounds to both hind legs.  Undeterred, and barely breaking stride, Kuno launched himself at the insurgent, biting his arm and wrestling him to the ground. The insurgent was quickly incapacitated, but despite his wounds, Kuno continued to attack to maintain the advantage. Kuno’s actions had altered the course of the battle the assault force swiftly entered the courtyard, neutralised the insurgent and cleared the remainder of the building. Only then did Kuno relent.Kuno was given immediate first aid, and was evacuated with the assault force, receiving life-saving care on the back of the helicopter. His injuries were severe one bullet narrowly missed a main artery and he required several lifesaving operations in theatre before he was stable enough to return the UK. Kuno’s injuries have proven life-changing and his rear paw could not be saved and was soon amputated. His loyalty, upbeat character and courage were ever-present through a prolonged period of rehabilitation and, despite his injuries, he has recovered well and is in good spirits and health.Kuno was a most invaluable team member. His instinctive courage and determination unlocked the stalemate and undoubtedly saved the lives of multiple coalition soldiers. The operation resulted in the most significant success against Al Qaeda for several years Kuno was fundamental in this. His recovery is on-going and he has been retired as a MWD. Kuno’s actions during this operation, and throughout his career, are utterly deserving of the PDSA Dickin Medal.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uber covered safety flaw let drivers swap photo ids","story":"Uber attempted to cover up a major safety flaw that allowed drivers to use fake identities, a court has heard.The ride-hailing app was accused of not notifying Transport for London of a glitch that let drivers swap their photos in the app, potentially letting drivers use profiles that were not theirs, in the run-up to the authority\u0027s decision not to renew Uber\u0027s licence to operate in London.Uber\u0027s licence was refused last November by TfL, which cited several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk. The cab app is appealing the decision and continues to operate in the capital under an extension while proceedings are ongoing.Yesterday, at a hearing at Westminster Magistrates\u0027 Court to prepare for the final appeal hearing next month, it was heard that Uber received 27,799 safety-related complaints in the first six months of 2019 alone.Read more: Britain will be Uber\u0027s next front in its fight to keep operatingThe company was also accused of ­allowing the glitch that let drivers use bogus identities and shared accounts, while not flagging the issue to TfL.In February, the black cab drivers\u0027 group the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u0027 Association (LTDA) was granted permission to take part in the appeal.At the hearing yesterday, Gerald Gouriet, for the LTDA, said: Uber ­attempted to conceal the photo fraud issue.

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course.

The colour was described as apricot.What arrived — several weeks later — was a beyond-hideous sartorial aberration that was “Made in China” , out of a paper-thin polyester that would make me think twice about standing near a naked flame.What’s more, the colour was more camel and blue than “apricot”, it swamped me, and the brown belt in the photo was nowhere to be seen.It cost me  — approx £ — and the s policy is so ­unintelligible that it’s not worth the bother.

I cannot remember any government being so devoid of direction, leadership, policy, conviction and — frankly — intelligence.And I had to endure Ted Heath AND John Major’s attempts to run the country. Oh, and the shaft of glorious sunshine that was Gordon Brown. Those guys have nothing on Boris. He is the clear leader in the field. If you ever wanted to know what a country would look likeit was led by Frank Spencer, here you go. Yes, I know — I’m showing my age. To be honest, under this administration I’m feeling my age.For those who don’t remember, Frank was a bumbling, dithering, halfwit from the s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The only dference with Bojo is that Frank was thinner. And, mercully, a fictional creation. Boris is all too real. Many kids will be going back to school wearing face masks. For ages, this government insisted that they would not have to do so. Now they’ve changed their minds. Face masks and grouped in “bubbles”. Probably getting only about half of their usual education,that. Any kid who coughs will be pounced upon, exiled to the Outer Hebrides and the entire school shuts down. Never mind that there has been no recorded case of a schoolkid passing on the virus to a teacher.Never mind that our economy needs the schools fully open with a proper, normal, timetable, so people can get back to work.After six months of no lessons , the kids now have to endure insufferable conditions at school.This is because Boris and the rest have proved utterly incapable of standing up to the teaching unions .Other U-turns have involved the wearing of masks in shops, the usefulness of masks in general, whether there’s any point in closing our borders, the schools due to re-open in June, the scrapping of an expensive track and trace system, the re-grading of GCSEs and A levels . . . oh lordy, the list goes on and on.Sometimes the U-turn appears only a day after the original decision.Sometimes we have to wait a week or so. But come they surely do, a long parade of staggering ineptitude. In fact, I think even Frank Spencer would have been more decisive. Maybe the right comparison is with Benny from Crossroads. Yes, it’s my age again. For those who don’t know, Benny was a cast-iron moron.We know that dealing with this horrible pandemic can’t have been easy. We know Boris has had a dficult year.But the utter lack of planning and resolve has been astonishing. Slow to take the virus seriously, bizarrely refusing to close our airports at the peak of the outbreak, hopelessly lost over track and trace and what do with our poor kids.This has been mismanagement on an almost heroic level. My guess is that Boris will not survive as Prime Minister: His party will get shot of him when the opportunity arises. Because here’s the crucial, damaging question.Could Jeremy Corbyn have handled this crisis any worse I DON’T think those smug monkeys at the BBC realised the fury they would unleash when they banned singing our favourite anthems at The Last Night Of The Proms.A petition reached , names in just  hours.And Dame Vera Lynn is suddenly at No in the iTunes chart with Land Of Hope And Glory.The BBC apparently agreed with the Finnish conductor, Dalia Stasevska, that the “jingoistic” words of Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia would not be heard this year.I wonder what convinced Ms Stasevska to agree to conduct an evening of patriotic songs when she hates patriotic songs Money, you would guess. Meanwhile another BBC bureaucrat, Cat Lewis, likened singing the songs to Nazis singing about gas chambers.Silly woman. The BBC – its entire staff – has no understanding of the British people. It despises them. Support for the corporation is at an all-time low.

As a result, very few people watch it — but it’s the toast of Beeb journos and left-wing social media, giving it undeserved influence over our daily news agenda.Despite her dressing-down over that outrageous Dominic Cummings monologue, Emily Maitlis is considered untouchable by executives. No one dares warn her that constant unbalanced questioning of Tory politicians and right-wing commentators is putting the very future of the Beeb under threat.And then there’s Lewis Goodall, the left-wing operative turned Newsnight policy editor who last week was allowed to author a feature for the New Statesman magazine headlined: “Failed.

The cost of the flat doesnt include bills, with Zoopla estimating the total monthly running of the flat will be £.Social media users reacted with shock after the listing went viral on Twitter, with some comparing the tiny flat to a prison.Others have hailed the clever use of space.One joked: This must be some kind of human rights violation, while another said: This is the type of thing I would build in Minecraft.A third went further, arguing: This looks like a Sims flat.One user said: Some prisons are more accommodating than this... and £ cheaper.Earlier this summer, a tiny studio flat with a shower and sink next to the bed went on sale for £,.The property - in Notting Hill, London - has little more than a single bed, a hob and a shower inside.Elsewhere in London, a property narrower than a bus went on sale in July for a whopping £,.The home in East Dulwich, which measures just ft in across, was converted from a derelict workshop.Another pricey - but tiny - flat has drawn lots of attention from viewers.The property may not look like much for £ a month - but it boasts incredibly views over Shenley Cricket Centre in Hertfordshire.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the Nottinghamshire restaurant hit back, accusing the family of reducing staff members to tears, being sick everywhere, damaging light fittings and smearing birthday cake over a table.In the review, Jo wrote: [They] didnt mind taking the £ though, I have never been spoken to in such a way. Maybe they should be open to reviews and yes our family member was sick and YES WE CLEANED IT UP - so no members of staff were affected by this.Maybe a course for your staff in customer service wouldnt go amiss - rude staff huffing and puffing because they had a large round to bring out!The Cowshed, which has a five star rating on TripAdvisor shared their version of events from the night on Facebook by saying: Hi Jo, thanks for reaching out!We love feedback, whether it be positive or negative, we especially love feedback like this so others can see the type of people we have to deal with sometimes.They began by addressing the amount of money Jo claimed the family had spent. The Cowshed team wrote: Our most expensive pizza on the menu is £., this means thatyou ordered only pizzas, youd have to order  of them to be even close to spending £. You didnt order  pizzas, Jo.But lets talk drinks... the most expensive drink we sell is a double gin  mixer at £., this means youd have to order  of these to be even close to spending £. You didnt order  double gin  mixers. So lets split the dference, seeing as you had spent the £ on both pizzas and drinks... you and your party would have to have ordered  of our most expensive pizzas and  of our most expensive drinks to have spent £ at our bar. You ordered nowhere near this, Jo... not even close.Laden with sarcasm, the owner went on to pull Jo up on her memory and maths, claiming that staff went over receipts and CCTV - revealing that the group had actually spent £.In the blazing response, the author of the Facebook post held Jo accountable for the partys behaviour towards staff and fellow diners. With the ironic exception of the young adults that were in your group and one or two others, you all acted like belligerent, entitled little toddlers from the moment you walked through our gates. We allowed members of your party to bring in food from other venues to circumvent their food allergies. We cleaned up all the smashed pint glasses you broke and birthday cake you dropped and smeared all over our tables  benches, and tolerated the many loud family rows you were having with each other.Rather than treat our staff like human beings that are just trying to earn a wage, you decided to treat them like your own personal servants, clicking your fingers, shouting, swearing and barking your orders at them, to the point one was almost in tears and refused to deal with you any more.You were the loudest, most obnoxious group in the whole bar, just being a nuisance in general and other customers were starting to complain about you at this point. Then, for your partys grand finale, the gentleman in the blue shirt headed into our bar from outside and decided to vomit everywhere but the toilet. Our staff stepped into to help, but you demanded to deal with the situation and rather than clean up the mess, proceeded to smear it over an even wider area with our mop, whilst... once again, being loud, rude, sticking your hand in our staffs faces and shouting over anybody who was trying to communicate with you or help.The restaurant explained that this is why they choose not to have the review comments turned on on their page - because it only gives one side of the story. They also corrected Jo on her accusations that she was barred. The post was closed with the Cowshed making it clear that there will be no more comments or responding on the thread to avoid keyboard warriors getting involved.The pub was inundated with praise from Facebook followers for their brave and brutal response. One person wrote I really want to visit Cowshed now! Never heard of the place before and already have so much respect for the staff there! Another said: Congratulations Cowshed, you have won the internet today!Somebody who works in hospitality wrote: Coming from a hospitality background having worked in many pubs and restaurants reviews like this can be so damaging and most of timeextremely untrue and made up!

I havent been on a holiday for years.This is my le over the  years, encapsulated in this ridiculous obsession. I dont know why I ever thought this lot would become an asset to the house, Paul said.

The pair were so close that Meghan, , asked Jessicaaposs children to be part of her bridal party. However they reportedly fell out after Jessica was accused of abusing her white privilege by influencer Sasha Exeter. Sasha said Jessica had taken offence to her call for bloggers and social media stars to speak out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The former athlete, who runs the SoSasha website, also claimed Jessica had sent her a message which seemingly threatened to destroy her career. Sasha, who has more than , Instagram followers, said it was an example of textbook white privilege.  After she went public with the message, Jessica issued an apology, which she posted on Sashaaposs Instagram page. But the influencer later claimed that Jessica had issued another threat to her in a private message, in which Jessica threatened to take her to court over the row. The -year-old Canadian stylist posted an apology on her own Instagram page, admitting Sasha rightfully called me out for not doing enough when it came to engaging in the important and dficult conversation around race. The controversy resulted in Jessica losing her job on ABCaposs Good Morning America and a string of fashion deals.  Meghan is claimed to have be mortied and heartbroken and has since kept her distance. Earlier this month Jessica broke her silence to say she was in the worst state on Instagram a she celebrated her twin boys, Brian and John, turning . She shared a video of her husband Ben carrying their birthday cake into their Toronto garden before adding an emotional message about how she has been affected by the backlash from her comments during a spat with black influencer Sasha Exeter.

I come from a family that believed singing ancient ditties about nationalist supremacy does not define how much you love the piece of land you were born on. We never went along with the view that believing in an innate sense of British exceptionalism, and being unquestioning about its history, made you a true patriot. The likes of Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson do. Or rather they exploit that myth for their own ends. Farage to whip up a rabid, right-wing following that has made him rich and famous, and Johnson to target a similar audience to win the Tory leadership. This latest confected rage about the BBC being woke snowflakes for pandering to the BLM movement is manna from heaven for them.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said there was a “limit” to remote working, amid fears over the economic impact on town and city centre businessesstaff stay at home. The Government is expected to launch a publicity blitz to encourage people back to work from next week. But union bosses said people will not be bullied into going back to office, warning: “Ministers are increasingly sounding like dinosaurs.”And Labour ’s Shadow Business Minister Lucy Powell blasted: “Forcing people to choose between their health and their job is unconscionable.”Mr Shapps, who did interviews from his home yesterday, said: “It is now safe to go back.

New advice, published late on the Friday before schoolsnext week, outline a number of contingency plans for a worst-case scenario. They include a rota system limiting the number of pupils going to secondary schools at any one time in local lockdown zones. Teachers and students may need to wear face coverings in communal areas, the guidance confirms. Labour has slammed the timing of the announcement late on Friday before a bank holiday weekend, saying it beggars belief. The new guidance comes as Boris Johnson reiterated his view that getting kids back is Britainaposs most important task and he insisted pubs would shut before schools in the event of any future spike in infections.The staggered rota approach of two weeks in and two weeks out of school will reduce how many people students come into contact with, helping to break transmission chains by giving enough time at home for symptoms to become apparent, said the Department for Education .If a coronavirus case is confirmed, every pupil in the affected personaposs class, or bubble, may have to quarantine for two weeks, it added.A bubble could be a small number of children or it could be as large as the entire year group. Those affected would need to switch to distance learning and stay home for  days. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said any changes to school attendance will only ever be an absolute last resort.  He added: However, it is important that both Government and schools prepare for a worst case scenario, so this framework represents the sensible contingency planning any responsible government would put in place. But school leaders criticised the timing of the announcement, which came on Friday evening just before the bank holiday weekend, with millions of pupils ing to class next week for autumn term. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: To wait until the Friday night before most schoolsisnapost the Governmentaposs finest moment. Obviously, schools havenapost had any chance whatsoever to incorporate this into their planning and will now have to revisit the plans they have put in place. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, added: Weaposve been calling for the Government to publish a Plan B for several weeks.  Finally it is here, but another late night publication is fairly typical of what weaposve become used to. Meanwhile, Labouraposs shadow education secretary Kate Green said the timing of the guidance beggars belief. She added: The Governmentaposs incompetence is insulting to the school leaders and teachers who have worked so hard over summer to prepare schools for children to . The y guidance said schools should base their plans on a four-tier system, and the extra measures for secondary schools should kick in at the second tier. It said: Schools should ideally operate a rota system that means pupils spend two weeks on-site followed by two weeks at home.  However, schools can choose to operate a one-week rota this is necessary for the effective delivery of the curriculum. The guidance added: In all areas of national government intervention, at schools where students in year seven and above are educated, face coverings should be worn by adults and pupils when moving around the premises, outside of classrooms, such as in corridors and communal areas where social distancing cannot easily be maintained. The DfE said any suspected coronavirus cases will need to self-isolate and get tested.  It added: If a case is confirmed, local public health officials will work with the school to take appropriate measures, including asking all members of a pupilaposs bubble to isolate for  days and access remote education while other pupils continue attending. The guidance does not apply to primary school children, as scientic evidence indicates they play a limited role in transmission, it added. All schools remain open at tier one, while tiers three and four mean more stringent restrictions such as closures to all but pupils in vulnerable groups or children of key workers.

Some cheeky punters have been gaming the August dining discount introduced to boost struggling cafes, pubs and restaurants after finding a catch. According to The , diners have been attempting to order their meals in parts - enabling them to split the bill per head throughout their stay - then applying the discount with every fresh transaction. The half-price discount has allowed savings of up to the value of £ off food and non-alcoholic drinks at participating establishments from Mondays through Wednesdays. Do you know of any Eat Out to Help Out scheme loopholes  Email webnews@mirror But dinersapos sneaky tactic could mean savings of up to £a table of six split a three course meal into staggered parts. According to the newspaper, several restaurants reported being asked to process bills for each course separately by customers - but most refused to do so. A Treasury source told thethere was nothing in the rules of the scheme to stop such behaviour. But a spokesperson for the Treasury called on the public to respect the spirit of the scheme, according to the newspaper. UK Hospitality added that it was aware of diners using the tactic.  Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, called the scheme a great success for coronavirus lockdown-hit hospitality businesses. But she said diners should checkthe business minds them gaming the billing before they try it. She told the newspaper: “Asking to be billed separately for inidual courses is not against the system. Businesses can claim back the money anyway, so, in theory, everybody benefitsthe discount is applied that way.  “It might cause administrative headaches for some businesses, though. So, it is a good ideacustomers talk to the business, ideally when they make their booking, to explain that’s how they want to be billed.” The loophole has reportedly annoyed some in the hospitality business.  But appear to have been encouraging tactical dining during Eat Out to Help Out month. Oisin Rogers, landlord of Guinea Grill and the Windmill in Mayfair, told thesome customers were buying their courses at separate establishments throughout the day to maximise their discount savings.

The increase in the number of new cases on the islands dropped signicantly to reach its lowest rise for more than a week as the country itself battles a second wave and has the highest infection rate across the EU EEA and UK area. Balearic Islands’ health chiefs announced  new Covid- cases late on Friday, down from  on Thursday and  on Wednesday. The rise in the number of new coronavirus positives was the lowest since the previous Thursday, when officials confirmed they had registered  new cases. However, Spain as a whole is still recording thousands of new cases of coronavirus every day, some regions on the mainland are still struggling to control outbreaks and other countries continue to impose new travel restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email your story to webnews@mirror. Spainaposs -day incidence rate of coronavirus is . cases per , people - the highest across the EU EEA and UK area - according to the latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. It was removed from the apossafe tavelapos list last month as cases soared in some regions, meaning anyone arriving in the UK from the mainland or islands must self-isolate for  days. The Foreign  Commonwealth Office currently advises against all non-essential travel to Spain, including the Balearic and Canary Islands, based on the current assessment of Covid- risks. The news was announced as police in Brit-popular islands started to hand out the first fines to people flouting stricter smoking restrictions, night-time beach bans, and prohibitions limiting the number of people who can socialise together to  at any one time.  Minimum fines for flouting a ban on smoking anywhere in public have been set at € . Authorities have warned people those who breach the social gathering numbers limit could be hit with fines of up to €, . Balearic Islands government spokesman Pilar Costa has said tougher measures may be introduced as the region seeks to combat its second wave of Covid- cases and rescue what is left of the tourist season. She warned on Saturday: “If the figures are not positive, we will have to toughen the measures. “Onlythe new restrictions have the desired effect can they be loosened.” The drop in the number of new Covid- cases will offer a glimmer of hope for Brits seeking autumn sunshine getaways. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps suggested last week islands like Ibiza or Majorca could be added to safe travel lists in future. The Balearic Islands government campaigned to get the region excluded from the UK government’s new Spanish quarantine rule when it was introduced last month. At the time the inclusion of the islands sparked uproar among tourists as the rates of infection were far below that of mainland Spain. A spike in the number of new cases later led to health chiefs in the Balearics admitting the islands were facing a second wave. One problem Brit holidaymakers could faceair bridges do become a reality is finding accommodation. Most of Majorca’s small and medium hotel chains are planning to close next week. In the Majorcan capital Palma  per cent of hotels are due to close until March. Javier Vich, president of the Hotel Association of Playa de Palma and Cala Mayor, told local press: “At the moment  of the  urban hotels are open, which is  per cent of the total.  “The outlook for November is very grim, with around  per cent of urban hotels due to close when in a normal year the figure would be  per cent.” Spain on Friday said it had diagnosed , new coronavirus cases in the previous  hours, down from a revised count of more than , on Thursday. It had previously said a record , new cases were detected. A cumulative total of , infections have been detected since the onset of the pandemic. In the past seven days,  people have died from the virus, bringing the total toll to ,, health ministry data showed.

The Duchess of Sussex, , cuddled her aides and was visibly emotional as she spent her final hours in the UK following her and Prince Harryaposs bombshell decision to step down as senior members of the Royal Family. The former Suits actress then jumped on the last commercial flight of the day to make it home before son Archie woke up the next morning. Omid Scobie, was one of a number of journalists invited to Meghanaposs final engagement - a private meeting with Association of Commonwealth Universities scholars - during which she spoke to students about their work on subjects including climate change. Mr Scobie later wrote in the book he co-authored with Carolyn Durand, Finding Freedom, about how Meghan used that meeting to bid a final farewell to her team at Buckingham Palace. And he revealed Meghan hugged him before saying the tear-jerking seven words: It didnapost have to been this way. Mr Scobie wrote: “Staff who had been with the couple from day one were mourning the end of what was supposed to be a happy story: two people fall in love, get married, have a baby, serve the Queen, the end. Instead, they were leaving the country. “As Meghan gave me a final hug goodbye, she said, ‘It didn’t have to be this way’.” The Duchess was said to be sad that things hadnapost gone dferently as she and Harry prepared to start a new le together in Canada, and later in the USA.  Mr Scobie writing for Harperaposs Bazaar, added that tears that the duchess had been bravely holding back [were] free to flow among familiar faces.He added: The Duchess of Sussex emotionally [bid] much-loved aides farewell, with her flight aposhomeapos to Canada leaving in a matter of hours. Meghan would fly back to Canada on the last commercial flight of the day, eager to be back in Vancouver Island by the morning before Archie wakes up. Meghan is also said to have tearfully told a pal I gave up my entire le for this family after she was blamed for her and Harryaposs decision to step back.  She reportedly she was willing to do whatever it takes. In their statement earlier this year, Harry and Meghan said they wanted to carve out a progressive new role within this institution after many months of reflection and internal discussions. The couple made their last public engagement together as royals on Monday, March . They attended the Commonwealth Day ceremony at Westminster Abbey with the Queen and a host of other top royals. Meanwhile, this week Meghan gushed about Harry being a proud feminist and a aposbeautulapos role model for their son Archie in a new interview about the importance of voting.She spoke excitedly about her husbandaposs influence to US rights activist Gloria Steinem as they discussed female representation in politics. I look at our son and what a beautul example that he gets to grow up with a father who is so comfortable owning that as part of his own self-identication, said Meghan. Harry and brother Prince William also revealed on Friday how they are commissioning a statue of their mother Princess Diana on what would have been her th birthday. It will sit in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace, where Diana lived before she died. A new joint statement released on Friday said the brothers hope that the statue will help those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on their motheraposs le and legacy. The statue was first announced in  to mark the th anniversary of her death, but while the creation progressed the installation was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.The date has now been set as July , .

The shocking incident was filmed in Peterborough on August  and it is unknown why the apparent road rage incident started. In the clip, bystanders shout out as the motorist, driving on the wrong side of the road, ploughs into the man, and the sound of the impact can be clearly heard.  The man is knocked off his feet by the Mercedes and flies onto the pavement. Astonishingly he picks himself back up and limps towards the Mercedes, which is reversing on the wrong side of the road towards a roundabout. The man and a woman dressed in white yell at the retreating driver to leave as they follow the car.  A small crowd of people gather to watch and a line of traffic can be seen stuck behind the incident. The couple turn back but then the Mercedes driver accelerates towards them and mounts the pavement towards the man.  As the Mercedes car drives off, the man smacks on the vehicle window in anger and the woman screams at the driver to leave. As the car flees the scene, a passenger in the front seat imitates a fake finger pistol sign at the pedestrian the vehicle just ran over. Social media users were left shocked by the clip and were astounded by how the hit-and-run victim managed to get up again. One user wrote: aposAsmy man got mowed down by a benz but got back up quickapos Another inidual commented: aposIs anyone  as surprised as I am by how he managed to get back up after being mowed down like that !apos Whilst one online user exclaimed: aposHow did he get back up apos "},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The woman called Jo left the review after visiting The Cowshed at Hucknall for her sister-in-lawaposs th birthday. She claimed that her party spent approximately £ between them on drinks and pizza before they were asked to leave by staff with awful attitude for being too drunk reported Daily Star. In the review Jo wrote, she said: [They] didn’t mind taking the £ though, I have never been spoken to in such a way. Maybe they should open reviews [on their website]. She then added: And, yes, our family member was sick, and yes, we cleaned it up so no members of staff were affected by this. Maybe a course for your staff in customer service wouldn’t go amiss – rude staff, huffing and puffing because they had a large round to bring out. But the restaurant, which has a five star rating on TripAdvisor, shared their version of events from the night on Facebook by saying: Hi Jo, thanks for reaching out! We love feedback, whether it be positive or negative, we especially love feedback like this so others can see the type of people we have to deal with sometimes.  Firstly, it said that Jo hadnapost spent the amount of money she claimed she did. To spend that amount of money they would have had to have ordered  of their most expensive pizzas and  of their most expensive drinks... The Cowshed continued: You ordered nowhere near this, Jo... not even close. What you and your party spent, Jo, was a far more realistic and believable £ . Then it got a little brutal.  It added: You all acted like belligerent, entitled little toddlers from the moment you walked through our gates. At :pm you showed up with the tables you wanted already taken, but not to worry, we shuffled other customers about at your request in order to accommodate you.  Then you proceeded to pull our light fittings loose off our boundary fence in order to hang your birthday decor. We cleaned up all the smashed pint glasses you broke and birthday cake you dropped and smeared all over our tables and benches, and tolerated the many loud family rows you were having with each other. The group also supposedly treated The Cowshedaposs staff  like personal servants. It wrote: Clicking your fingers, shouting, swearing and barking your orders at [staff], to the point one was almost in tears and refused to deal with you any more. But it didnapost stop there. The group also refused to abide by social distancing rules following the coronavirus pandemic. Then, for your partyaposs grand finale, the gentleman in the blue shirt headed into our bar from outside and decided to vomit everywhere but the toilet. Our staff stepped into to help, but you demanded to aposdeal with the situationapos and rather than clean up the mess, proceeded to smear it over an even wider area with our mop, whilst... once again, being loud, rude, sticking your hand in our staffaposs faces and shouting over anybody who was trying to communicate with you or help. Donapost worry, the staff member that you nearly had in tears earlier on cleaned it up for you.

Fagan, then , was fixated on the Queen, who he says sat up in bed and demanded to know what he was doing before she ran out of the room in her nightie to get help that morning in July . Their brief encounter was one of the worst royal security breaches in the th Century after dad-of-four Fagan - who says he was depressed after his we Christine left him - clambered into the central London palace through an open window despite high security. He twice broke into the palace in a matter of weeks, and claimed during an earlier incident he urinated in corgi food and downed red wine, later blaming magic mushrooms.  The bedroom incident will feature in the new series of the Netflix programme The Crown, with Oscar winner Olivia Colman as the Queen and actor Tom Brooke as Fagan. Retired decorator Fagan, now , told the Sun that he was left to raise his four young children on his own, so he wanted to find outthe Queen, then , could solve his problems.After scaling a ft railing and climbing a drainpipe, he crawled through an open window and then began wandering the halls, slipping past staff, wearing just jeans and a T-shirt after taking off his socks and sandals. He triggered an alarm but officers in the palace police control room twice turned it off, thinking the system was faulty.Fagan, who lives in Islington in north London, said he tried a door that wasnapost guarded and had no nameplate, and he found himself in a small room with a double bed and a plain chest of drawers after wandering through the palace. He said: “I pulled back the curtains and the woman in bed sits up and says in an accent like the finest glass, ‘What are you doing here ’ “There’s the Queen in front of me. I was dumbstruck. I don’t know anyone  who wouldn’t be. He said the Queen, who was alone, didnapost appear to be frightened, but was shocked and used a phone on the bedside table to call security. In previous interviews he has told how the monarch told him Get out, get out. Fagan claims the Queen, wearing a knee- nightie with a Liberty print, climbed out of bed and told him Just one minute, Iaposll get someone, and ran out of the room in her bare feet. Blood was dripping from his hand after he smashed a glass ashtray before entering the room. He claims he smashed it so he could use a shard to cut through pigeon netting on his way back down the drainpipe. The barefoot prowler sat on her bed for about three minutes before a footman entered and told him F*** me, you look like you could do with a drink, he claims.  He claims the footman poured him a glass of Famous Grouse whisky as they waited for police to arrive, and he told officers he was Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess. He said he was interrogated by Special Branch detectives at a police station, and they determined he posed no threat to the royals. Recalling the incident, he said he scaled ft railings at .am on July , , and managed to elude an off-duty police officer, who alerted palace guards. Fagan was not charged with a crime, and he today suspects palace officials did not want the Queen to give evidence in court.  The intruder told police it wasnapost the first time he broke into Buckingham Palace. Just a month earlier, he scaled the railings, climbed up a drainpipe and entered the bedroom of a maid, who ran an alerted security, who found no-one in her room and thought she had imagined it. In a number of interviews over the years, he has claimed he urinated in corgi food and downed red wine in Prince Charles’ secretary’s room. The break-in occurred just two weeks after Princess Diana gave birth to Prince William, and Fagan has claimed he entered a room full of gts for the newborn, and saw doors with nameplates reading Dianaaposs room and Charlesaposs room. He once told the Independent: I sat on the thrones like Goldilocks and the three bears. In a  BBC radio interview he said he didnapost think much of the palace, saying it was dusty with squeaky floorboards, and maybe it was due a redec As for his motive, he blamed too many magic mushrooms in soup he had eaten five months earlier.

Many parents, pupils and teachers are excited to get back into the routine and although it’s understandable to have a few worries the benefits of going back into education are clear. Not only will pupils be learning again, but they’ll benefit from the sense of routine, the chance to see their friends and a boost to their wellbeing. With new safety measures in place things will look a bit dferent, but pupils will be guaranteed plenty of support from their teachers.  Dr Paul Phillips CBE, , the Principal and Chief Executive of the Weston College Group in Somerset is one of many leaders who’s worked hard to make the learning environment safe and welcoming for ing students. He said: If you came into my campuses you’d see the one-way system, you’d see all the sanitisers, you’d see the counselling service, you’d see the ability for us to check temperatures, but behind that are the inidual learning plans for each student. That’s where the crucial planning really takes place. We’ve increased the number of mental health advisors and support workers who are here, we’ve put a massive investment into all levels of additional learning support at tutorial level, mentoring and one-to-one teaching. I’ve doubled the amount of cleaners in the college – I just need to be assured that everything we do is protecting everyone.  Home schooling hasn’t been easy and many parents are worried that their children have fallen behind, but parenting expert and author Dr Kalanit Ben-Ari believes they’ll catch up quickly and that getting back into the classroom will boost their mental health. I’m not worried about the academic gap, because I think kids will pick up very quickly. But it’s starting to affect their mental health more and more, so it’s good that they will be back in school from September, says Dr Ben-Ari. Children are not designed to sit down all day. They need to be out in the fresh air and moving their bodies. It’s so important for children of all ages to interact with their friends face to face for communication, and non-verbal communication.  Kids at home have spent a long time on screens while parents are working and they don’t have the resources to entertain and teach their children at home. Spending more time on screens will have affected their mental health: it increases anxiety, especially with children who are a little bit more vulnerable to it. For Chloe Williams, a beauty therapy student at Weston College, thecan’t come soon enough. I feel ready to go for a long-awaited  and seeing the new socially distanced facilities has been great, she says. My tutors are very approachableI have any worries and we are all helping each other. The PHE’s Chief Nurse, Viv Bennett, says: Parents can be reassured that to maximise safety in schools, an extremely stringent system of controls has been advised by PHE and is published in DfE guidance. Evidence so far indicates that schools do not appear to be a primary driver of coronavirus infections in the community. Globally, children and young people have been found to experience coronavirus asymptomatically or as a minor illness.  The Government’s new Wellbeing for Education Return package has training and resources for teachers and young people to protect their wellbeing and mental health. Now the NHS Test and Trace system is up and running and there’s more understanding about what needs to be done to stay safer. Children should stay at homethey have any symptoms such as a fever, continuous cough or loss of taste and smell. If there is an outbreak at a school or college, local health protection teams will work with staff to agree what action is needed. Schools shouldn’t need to close fully, butthey do there’ll be a contingency plan in place to make sure children’s education continues. It’s vital that young peopleto school and college for their educational progress, mental wellbeing and wider development, so attendance is mandatory from the beginning of the new school year. For post-, attendance is important becausea student doesn’t turn up their college may believe they’ve left the course. Schools and colleges have put in a raft of measures to keep pupils and staff safe, including staggered start and finish times and lunch breaks, one-way systems, extra cleaning and encouraging regular handwashing. Where it’s dficult to maintain social distancing, with younger children, contact between groups or “bubbles” will be limited. This means things will look a little dferent, soparents or young people are anxious or worried about ing, they should have a chat with teachers. Parents with younger children are encouraged to take up a nursery place because it provides a routine and helps them develop their social skills. The Government offers a wide range of financial support for families with children aged up to , including Tax-Free Childcare worth up to £, per child per year and you can also apply for a  hours free childcare place before  August.

Jean Hendrie, , who had to leave her home, said: “One of my neighbours was flooded and the water came right up to her kitchen worktops, and there are cars that are written off.” But the disruptive weather which has followed storms Ellen and Francis, leading to flooding and travel disruption, will ease into the weekend as a large area of high pressure builds across the UK. Chief meteorologist at the Met Office, Frank Saunders, said: “We’ve seen a real mix of weather this August, with a heatwave earlier this month and in the past week we’ve had two named storms bringing very wet and windy weather across the country.“With high pressure on the way this weekend, we’re going to end the month with much more settled weather, with plenty of late summer sunshine for many.  “It’ll be a dry weekend for most areas, too, though eastern areas can expect a few heavy showers on Saturday.” He added: “It’ll feel quite cool despite the sunshine, as northerly winds bring below average temperatures for the time of year with highs of around  to  Celsius. At night it’ll feel really quite chilly, with temperatures dropping to single figures for most.” The coldest daytime maximum temperature over the August Bank Holiday weekend since it was introduced in  is .C in  at Cromdale, in the Scottish Highlands.

But staycationers will have to cope with cool temperatures, with more high winds and foggy spells forecast as temperatures take a nosee.The gloomy weather comes after Storm Francis wreaked havoc on the country earlier this week, with those heading away this weekend also warned to expect traffic chaos after millions hit the roads on Fridays, sparking huge delays on motorways.Latest BBC forecasts show temperatures as low as C in Edinburgh on Saturday night. The mercury will drop to C in Manchester on the same evening, while London is set to have a low of C. This comes just days after the UK experienced a y spell of scorching hot weather, with highs of C in the South East. Slightly warmer and sunnier weather should arrive from Sunday but temperatures should still struggle to exceed the late teens. Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office Frank Saunders said: “We’ve seen a real mix of weather this August - with a heatwave earlier this month and in the last week we’ve had two named storms bringing very wet and windy weather across the country.“With high pressure on the way this weekend we’re going to end the month with much more settled weather, with plenty of late summer sunshine for many. It’ll be a dry weekend for most areas too, though eastern areas can expect a few heavy showers on Saturday.”Mr Saunders continued: “It’ll feel quite cool despite the sunshine, as northerly winds bring below average temperatures for the time of year with highs of around  to  Celsius. At night it’ll feel really quite chilly, with temperatures dropping to single figures for most, and a chance of air frost in Scottish glens. Deputy Chief Meteorologist Chris Tubbs, said: “Later on Monday low-pressure will once again start to edge it’s way in from the Atlantic and it’ll turn cloudier with outbreaks of rain for Northern Ireland, with cloud and rain spreading to the rest of the UK by Tuesday. It’s likely to stay unsettled into the remainder of next week as we begin meteorological Autumn, with spells of wind and strong winds at times.” "},{"url":null,"title":"utter disbelief chippy customer tries","story":"NewsUtter disbelief as chippy customer tries to use Eat Out to Help Out for week of foodThe Eglinton Diner and Fish Fry chippy in Saltcoats slammed the customers greed after he tried to use Eat Out to Help Out to get half price on eight suppers in one go to keep him goingShareCommentsByJoseph WilkesReporter:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video restaurants-still-offer-eat-out-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Ronnie Long, , was accused of raping Sarah Bost, , at knepoint in her home in Concord, North Carolina on the evening of April , . He was sentenced to  years in prison for first-degree rape and first-degree burglary. What followed were decades of appeals for his conviction to be overturned. Then, in , Ronnie filed a petition to review biological evidence from the scene and to submit DNA testing. It then emerged that hair samples and clothing fibers didnapost match Ronnie, and it was later discovered that none of the evidence was ever shared with the defense during his trial in . And in , it was revealed that  fingerprints from the crime scene excluded Long as the source of those prints, according to court documents. Despite these revelations, his quest for a new trial was rejected by the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. But earlier month, a court ruled Long’s due process rights were violated under the constitution when he was convicted. Ronnie walked from prison a free man on Thursday. He told reporters outside the court: They will never ever, never ever ever, lock me up again.  This is real. Iaposm going to try to enjoy every minute of it. According to court documents a man entered the home of Bost, who was  at the time, in . He also put a kne to her throat. When Bost was unable to give the intruder any money, the man became angry, cursed her, threw her to the ground, ripped her clothes off, beat her, and raped her. The next day, Bost was shown  photos of potential suspects. Ronnie was not included in the photos and she could not identy any of them as the attacker.  Two weeks later, detectives told Bost that her attacker might be in court on the day she was asked to attend. Long attended court for a separate trespassing charge and Bost said she recognised Longaposs voice. She later picked Long out of a photo lineup.  She told officers there was no doubt in her mind that this person Ronnie Long was the person who entered her house. Despite the lack of physical evidence linking Ronnie to the crime scene and an alibi, he was arrested and later found guilty.  Longaposs mother and the mother of his two-year-old son at the time said he was on a group phone call with them when the attack was reported to have taken place, records say. Long lived with his mother and was preparing to attend a party in Charlotte that night, they said. The fourth Circuit opinion, led by Judge Stephanie D. Thacker, cited a troubling and striking pattern of deliberate police suppression of material evidence. A main argument by prosecutors to the jury, it said, was that police acted honestly.  A petition was launched calling for Ronnie to be released. Nearly , signed it. Speaking outside of the prison, Ronnie told WBTV : Don’t ever give up. No matter how rough it can be, always believe that you can overcome. The name of the game is surviving.“Hopefully incidents like this can be avoided. If you see injustice being done against somebody - then speak out against it. Speak out,you don’t then hate it, hate it with all your heart.” Hi sister Lynda Smith added: “Yeah, this is the happiest news I done had in a long time. “The Long family have really had their moments, and this is lted a big burden off of us.”Jamie Lau, Ronnieaposs attourney, broke the news of his release on Twitter.He tweeted: The State of NC filed a motion with the Fourth Circuit this morning asking that it immediately issue the mandate in Ronnie Long’s case.

Ye Ming Yuen, , was found in possession of drugs in a park in , and later pleaded guilty to drug trafficking after he admitted he shared them with friends. He was then caught using drugs again while on bail and was sentenced to  years in prison, along with the maximum number of strokes a male inmate can receive in Singapore. Describing the excruciating pain, Mr Yuen said the lashes were from a ft bamboo cane onto his naked buttocks while being secured to a large wooden trestle at Changi Prison on Wednesday. His injuries were so bad he was left with bowel problems and a paralegal almost fainted after seeing his injuries. The UK has since condemned Singapore over the flogging. Ravi Madasamy is considering taking legal action on behalf of Mr Yuen under the international human rights law. Human rights campaigners described the caning as inhuman, degrading and indecent.After ing to the prisonaposs visiting room, Mr Madasamy told the Mail Online : All over his buttocks were multiple marks and deep lacerations. It was so shocking my female paralegal who was with me almost fainted. The wounds were so deep with blood, flesh and layers of the skin exposed. He didn’t have any bandages, just a towel to put over the buttocks. He couldn’t sit for too long so he was standing up. It was the first time I had seen raw injuries like this and it left me deeply affected, thinking, “How can this be allowed to happen in a civilised country  Mr Yuen was flogged just one week after his appeal for clemency failed.  He could hear the screams and cries from fellow inmates being caned as he awaited his turn, before he was then strapped to the trestle, and a series of caners would take turns delivering the punishment to his naked buttocks with a cane soaked in water. The punishments was so severe, the caners had to swap after every six strokes to rest. Mr Yuen said he and the other inmates who suffered the flogging were sat on a bench with blood oozing, before a doctor gave them painkillers and anitbiotics. The pain left him unable to control his bowels and impossible to sit, with human lawyers warning that just six lashes are enough to cause le-long spinal and kidney injuries. Yuen moved to Singapore when he was  to live with relatives after his father was made bankrupt and could not afford his school fees at the £,-a-year Westminster School in London. According to reports, police officers found Yuen with g and g of cannabis, while another involved g of crystal meth when he was arrested in . Those caught in possession of more than g face the death penalty by hanging. In the UK, his offences at most would have seen him sentenced to prison for  months. Yeunaposs family member shared a letter that arrived from the -year-old this week, in which he pleads with the British public and the international community to stand with him to put an end to caning.

What a waste of time.#How are ministers meant to knowtheir measures are having any impact at all or which countries pose a dangerthey don#t hold these numbers  It beggars belief.#I#m convinced that this Scottish Government has no clue about how to manage the easing of lockdown while protecting both people#s lives and livelihoods.#Public Health Scotland#s Covid- statistics report will include for the first time on August  data on the number of people arriving in Scotland from outside the UK, the number required to quarantine and those contacted by government tracers.Ms Freeman admitted early last month that no checks had yet been carried out on whether iniduals arriving in Scotland from abroad had been abiding by quarantine rules because of a delay in accessing Home Office systems.Public Health Scotland now receives the contact details of any passengers identied as requiring to self-isolate as part of an agreement with the Home Office.The body then selects a random sample of quarantined passengers to contact with public health advice and information.Official records show , successful contacts have been made since June , with a further  in progress, and , emails have been sent with additional public health guidance in relation to quarantine and self-isolation.Nicola Sturgeon was challenged on the issue at the Scottish Government#s daily coronavirus briefing on Thursday.The first minister said genomic sequencing work had provided insight into the number of importations of the virus into Scotland between February and March.#Some of this is not quite as straightforward as you might think,# Ms Sturgeon said.#We obviously look at cases very closely on a daily basis, so there will be intelligence being gathered on whether people who have cases have had recent travel history.#But you cannot then make an automatic assumption that somebody who was, for argument#s sake, in Spain a few weeks ago and is now in Scotland with the virus, brought it here from Spain. They may have picked it up here.##And that#s where the genomic sequencing work is an important part of robustly validating that kind of information.#We will always look at the information that can be reliably made available from the daily work that Public Health Scotland do looking at cases but the question of where someone got coronavirus sometimes needs more scientic explanation.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Where that’s not possible, every second piece of kit will be made available.“In the pool, customers will be able to book a fast, medium or slow lane and numbers will be restricted like they are in the gym.#Duncan added: “It’s been a very challenging few months, especially for places such as ASV which are so socially-inclusive. We have got a huge amount of space because generally we have a high volume of people.“To see it with nobody in it was quite heartbreaking.“However, we have our date for reopening and we are excited about it. We’re very much looking forward to opening our doors and welcoming customers back, but more importantly our customers are looking forward to coming back.“We have had great feedback from our customers during lockdown telling us how important ASV is to their physical and mental wellbeing and how excited they are we’ve got a date for opening.“They’re telling us how much they’re looking forward to coming back and getting stuck in again.”Lisa Vass, a personal trainer at ASV, said the staff at the centre are excited to be welcoming customers back.She said: “I am so excited. I just can’t wait because it’s been the longest five months of my le.“The safety measures are massively important, not just for the customers but for the staff as well. We will be teaching classes and moving between dferent groups of people so it’s really important to make sure everyone is maintaining a high standard of hygiene.#Sport Aberdeen has also been gearing up for customers to , and will be reopening seven of its venues on Monday.Classes willto its Get Active @ Jesmond facility, and instructors Lisa Christie and Pete Smith are looking forward to welcoming participants back # albeit with smaller class sizes and physical distancing in place.Lisa said: “I am very excited. It’s a community, it’s more than just a class. It’s seeing faces, getting to know people and going on a journey with them.“People are being encouraged to wear face masks when they come in and walk through the corridors. There’s hand-sanitising stations and social distancing in place in the hall, and it goes above the requirements because the space is larger than the two metres.“The class numbers are smaller and there are limited numbers in other areas too. We’ve done everything we’ve been told to in order to get reopened.“I feel safe with it, and I’m sure the participants will feel the same.“I’ll still be delivering the same class. There might be a few modications, such as running on the spot rather than running round the room, but that will become part of the norm.”Pete added: “It’s been a very long five months and it’s great to get back and see everyone.“The customers are all desperate to get back. They’ve been doing things over Zoom and Facebook Live but it’s not the same as having an instructor screaming and shouting at you!“It’s not going to be the same as before but it’s going to improve a lot of people’s lives.#Among those ing will be Hazel Mauchline, who revealed she was looking forward to getting back to her classes rather than a makesht gym in her home.She said: “I can’t wait to get back. You get to meet your gym friends, members of staff and instructors.“As well as it being exercise physically, it’s massively important from a mental point of view for people to get back to the gym and get stuck in.“I am really comfortable with the measures that have been put in place. There’s so much in place.“Everyone’s got their own level of concern and we have to respect that but it’s just as safe to go to the gym as it is to go the supermarket.”Sport Aberdeen has already been able to reopen some of its facilities, such as golf and tennis, and has seen an increase in membership in recent months.Sales and retention manager Ally Barron hopes the opening of gyms will encourage others to sign up.He said: “It’s the day we’ve been waiting for for the last five months. We’ve been putting all the protocols in place and making sure everyone knows exactly what’s happening.“Loads of work has gone into it. We are opening up seven dferent venues on Monday and everything has had to be spaced out and altered.“It’s going to look completely dferent and people are going to have a new normal to get used to but it’s going to go really well.“When it started shutting down we wanted to make sure our members would stay with us, so we froze all the memberships.“We were able to open up our golf venues a couple of months ago and that has been absolutely brilliant.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges. P  pupils Ross Potter-Irwin and Henry Small should get their Bikeability badges in term time next year.Through partnership with the Ardrishaig Bothy, Cycling Scotland is offering schools free instructor support, instructor training and resources to deliver Bikeability Scotland training.Bikeability Scotland is the national cycle training programme designed to give children the skills and confidence they need to cycle safely on the roads and to encourage them to carry on cycling into adulthood.

I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

Obviously they are glad to see the children getting back to some sort of normality in schooling, but they have trusted us with the arrangements to safeguard the children and I feel very lucky to have that support.#Faced with a constantly changing picture, both locally and nationally, Miss Devine commented: #It is challenging to respond to that and keep lines of communication open with parents. Argyll and Bute Council has been good at giving guidelines to schools and that has helped a lot.#The council has also supplied hand sanitiser, face masks, gloves and visors and, said Miss Devine, the school is prepared to deal with anyone displaying symptoms.#We have thermometers in the school and we would testwe had concerns about a child becoming ill. There are straightforward guidelines that when a child displays symptoms they should be isolated and taken home immediately.#She added: #As yet we haven#t haven#t had to put those measures into practice.#In the event of a pupil being unable to attend school, Miss Devine confirmed that the online teaching s have been retained #as a safety net#.Miss Devine concluded: #Everybody is having to get used to the new health and safety protocols, but thus far people feel well supported.

adventure-seekers take to the climb for hours on end.But with almost  to pick from, it can be a dficult decision.Here, weve pulled together five Munros wed love to try:Braeriach, CairngormsThe Cairngorms are quite dferent to many of other Scottish mountain ranges. Although their summits are mostly rounded and sweeping, they combine to make a vast and wholly unique landscape.The mountains in the Cairngorms rise up out of the remnants of the ancient Caledonian pinewoods and are home to superb wildle and an array of dramatic corries. Braeriach is the third highest mountain in the British Isles and is protected by a long approach walk through a natural tree line.This Munro comes in at km and takes around - hours to complete.Braeriach, Aviemore, PH QTBraeriachBeinn Alligin, TorridonBeinn Alligin, meaning jewelled mountain, is one of three of the Torridon giants and well deserving of its name. This magnicent pair of munros has its own pinnacle ridge called the Horns of Alligin.Sitting on the seaward side of Torridon it has an unmatched viewpoint with glimpses of Skye and the sea to one side, and great peaks on the other side with the Horns providing a stunning foreground.The Munro is around km and takes around - hours.Beinn Alligin Torridon, Alligin, AchnasheenBuachaille Etive Mor, Glen CoeBuachaille Etive Mor is the head of Glen Coe and reigns supreme with its awe-inspiring pyramidal appearance. It is affectionately known by many climbers as the Bookie and, along with its twin Buachaille Etive Beag, are among the most photographed of the Scottish mountains and itrsquos easy to see why!This Munro is perfect for those who want a climb and some incredible views.It is around km and takes around - hours to complete.Aonach Eagach Ridge, A, Ballachulish PH HXLiathach, TorridonAnother of Torridonrsquos three mountains, Liathach is perhaps the finest of them all. Its higher Munro looks almost inaccessible from most directions and even the easiest ascent involves a bit of scrambling but itrsquos certainly worth the effort.Beyond this point the mountain becomes even more dramatic and offers the perfect path for thrill seekers to climb to the top. The hidden north side of the mountain is even more spectacular and is well worth exploring.Slightly longer than the other of Torridonrsquos mountains this walk is around .km and takes around - hours.Achnasheen, IV ETLiathachSgurr nan Gillean, SkyeMany regard Sgurr nan Gillean as being the finest peak on Skye and it is one of the more dficult on this list. Even the easiest ascent on the southeast ridge is a pretty tough scramble ndash the other two ridges venturing into the realm of rock climbing.It appears fairly dramatic from Sligachan but this actually conceals much of the mountainrsquos finest features and its only upon a closer visit to Coire a Bhasteir that the true scale and magnicence of the Pinnacle Ridge reveals this Munrorsquos true stature.This walk is around km and takes roughly  to  hours to complete.Skye, IV SW"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-maskne-seven-ways-look-skin-wearing-masks","story":"Facemasks are gradually becoming the new norm in our everyday lives with the coverings helping protect us and those around us.However, people wearing face coverings every day have been noticing that they have started to break out in acne, rashes and skin irritations.Have you had more breakouts since you started wearing a mask We have spoken to Dermalogica skin care expert and beautician Ashley Richards to find out why this happens and how you can protect your skin.What is ldquomaskne Maskne occurs when sweat, oil and bacteria are trapped on your skin while wearing a mask, creating the perfect breeding ground for breakouts.What causes it Maskne is caused by friction, rubbing, and occlusion of the skin by outside forces.Wearing a mask can trap dirt, oil, swear and humidity around the skin.Friction and irritation from the mask pushes bacteria into the skin, which creates micro-tears, and allows the bacteria and dirt to enter the skin more easily.This will lead to blackheads and whiteheads along the bridge of your nose, cheeks and chin. Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water - so it is like a magnet for moisture.,params: .pushUsing hyaluronic acid regularly will leave the skin feeling super-soft, radiant and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Hyaluronic acid has antibacterial properties meaning it will help soothe and protect chapped, irritated skin.FoundationsOpt for tinted moisturisers rather than a heavy foundation or go bare faced to help cause less clogging in your pores - but donrsquot forget your SPF!MoisturisersHeavier moisturisers will sit on the skin for longer due to the humidity of wearing the mask which can cause further clogging and irritation of the skin.However, donrsquot want to stop using a moisturiser all together as our skin still requires hydration and moisture.Instead try using a light and soothing moisturise such as Charlotte Tilburyrsquos Magic Cream light.Chapped SkinFor those suffering from chapped skin try using a physical barrier cream such as Dermalogicarsquos Barrier Repair.Barrier Repair shields against environmental pollution and helps forty sensitive skin with a damaged barrier."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-mobile-testing-unit-hawick---know","story":"A MOBILE-TESTING unitwill run in Hawick for six days, according to NHS Borders.It comes following an outbreak in the townlinked to three businesses.The testing unit will operate from tomorrowuntil Wednesday, September .It will be based in the Teviotdale Leisure Centre car park on Mansfield Road, with tests available between pm-pm.An NHS Borders spokesperson said: \"The MTU can only take a limited number of people each day so it is essential that only people with COVID- symptoms book a test.\"Other household members must self-isolate but should not be tested unless they too are showing any symptoms.\"The symptoms of COVID- are a high temperature or fever a new continuous cough or a loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.\"Tests, which must be booked in advance, can be arranged by visiting this websiteor calling  .The new unit will run alongside the existing facility in Galashiels Netherdale car park, which will operate betweenam and pm.If travellingto a mobile unit is not possible, people can arrange for a home test kit to be posted through their door.NHS Borders jointdirector of public health, Tim Patterson, said: \"I realise that people in Hawick will have concerns about the virus as a result of this outbreak.\"Unfortunately this can lead to the circulation of unsubstantiated rumours, especially on social media.\"I would like to re-iterate that it is crucial for everyone in the community to follow our advice and avoid speculation and rumour about the outbreak.\"Dr Patterson added: \"In terms of schools, all education settings in Hawick are currently safe places for children to learn.\"Unless your child has been asked to self-isolate by NHS Borders Test and Protect team they should attend school as normal.\"However it remains vital that no child attends schoolthey are displaying any COVID- symptoms.\"At the time of publication, a total of nine new cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders in recent days,bringing the regions total to  since the outbreak began.To book a testing unit appointment or a free home testing kit, visit: www.gov.uk get-coronavirus-test or you can call:   "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"In the last week, demands for Covid testing in Scotland have surged.The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.When should you take a test If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because there is greater scope for physical distancing and face coverings can have an impact on teaching.However it remains the case that where adults cannot keep m distance and are interacting face-to-face

on how to put on, remove, and store face coverings.\"Any staff member or pupil will still be able to wear a face covering when they wish to do so.\"John Swinney confirmed the new guidanceWhy is this being done Mr Swinney added:ldquoThere is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them.\"We also know that some pupils have found it very dficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus.\"And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between dferent age groups.\"What  was said Mr Swinney said:ldquoWe want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools.\"Alongside this change to the wearing of face coverings, we need to reinforce the importance of maintaining high standards of cleaning, personal hand and respiratory hygiene and physical distancing, where possible.\"In situations where there is a local cluster, use of face coverings throughout the day may be required.ldquoThe position will be kept under review to ensure that our

Across the UK, as headlines foretold the devastation lockdown would wreak on this seasonal trade ndash footage of acres of wilting plants was grim ndash cannier businesses immediately shted to online and telephone orders. And, as recent figures show, people responded enthusiastically. During that period, Britons spent around pound. billion on garden plants, materials and tools. Contrary to the stereotypical picture of a Mr McGregor retiree, footering around in his potting shed, it was millennials who spent most. Their investment was double that of the rest of us, with the - age group spending an average pound per person, compared with pound among others.Some of that might be explained by the urgent need for equipment to turn a rectangle of grass into a more imaginative space for all the family to enjoy. Irsquom long past their age but still so new to gardening that I recall those early months as a ceaseless outlay on shears, secateurs, spades, forks, trowels, rakes, sieves... I could go on. Hence the need for a shed, which was soon festooned with tools dangling from hooks, propped against walls and stacked on shelves. Think of an Italian deli, with hams and salamis overhead, and floor to ceiling storage. Replace the delicious aroma of cheeses, coffee beans and truffles with potting compost, muddied buckets and oil to keep blades moving, and you get the picture.There are professional horticulturalists where I live who are well under , but thatrsquos probably not surprising. Those who choose to live in the country are already keen on the outdoors, whatever their vintage. Yet there is something of a renaissance occurring in this generation, as interest in their own plot is sparked into le, whether itrsquos an allotment, balcony, or back yard.In response to what you might call a growing trend, Alan Titchmarsh has said that he hopes more young folk will be encouraged to pick up their trowels and dig up drives, to help protect the planet. ldquoItrsquos not just about going on marches, he says. ldquoBeing practical is a hugely underrated resource and skill.Those who have unexpectedly found themselves with time to devote to their patch have probably realised how enjoyable it is too. Being in the fresh air, surrounded by birds, and perhaps with children larking around, has shown how much pleasure can be had in maintaining your part of the world. At this stage of le, competition for peoplersquos spare time is usually ferocious, with the demands of socialising, keeping fit and raising a family. In the past, unless you were actively emulating the Good Le, choosing to spend the weekend planting drills of potatoes or deadheading roses was borderline eccentric.Being forced to spend so much time at home has clearly made people reassess their outdoor space, and consider its potential. Making their plot child-friendly has been a priority for some. But for those who dread the thought of a football landing on tender seedlings and new blooms, there should be no conflict between serious cultivation and youngsters ndash quite the opposite. The earlier children encounter flowers and trees and the wildle they attract, the better for all our futures. And the sooner they recognise the need to treat living things with respect ndash although some trampling and breakage is almost inevitable ndash the more they will understand not just how nature works, but the ways in which we can support it.Irsquove lost count of the number of people who have said how much they have relished this aspect of lockdown. Having nowhere  to go has allowed them to concentrate on matters horticultural, and take time to make decisions or try experiments they otherwise could not have attempted. Having many more unfilled free hours has its upsides, as one neighbour has discovered. When the pandemic took hold she turned her greenhouse into a hotbed of tomatoes and her flowerbeds into a lettuce patchwork, and has been feasting on salads all summer. As have her friends.Inevitably, once the world opens up again, some recent converts will lose interest and the weeds will take revenge. Yet I have no doubt that many will already be hooked. The secret that no gardener ever mentions is that it is addictive. Each tiny success gives confidence to try something more adventurous. Mistakes are inevitable, but so are accidental triumphs. The thrill of discovering strawberries or nasturtiums thriving where before was a bed of nettles, is inspiring. The sight of bees and birds hovering for nectar, seeds and grubs is like preparing a banquet and watching as guests pile their plates high. To be honest, environmental reasons for sustainable, eco-friendly gardening are all but forgotten in the joy it brings. The reason why benches in most well-tended grounds go largely unused is because therersquos always something clamouring for attention. To sit sipping a GT while an unpruned shrub stares at you reproachfully, or a juicy stick of rhubarb cries out to be picked, is almost impossible.In my own limited experience, trying to keep on top of it all ndash and never coming remotely close ndash is part of what it is about. An expert recently told me that a garden will take all the time you give it, and then some. Yet the depths of winter is the time to put your feet up . The rest of the year is for helping the green things around you put down sturdy roots. As millennials can confirm, it has a very stabilising, calming effect on us too.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

In addition, pound.bn is removed from Scotlands accounts for UK defence , plus pound.bn for other UK services home and abroad, all of which a Scottish government with dferent priorities could reduce.Many small European countries have matched the UKrsquos Covid financial response and last year Norwayrsquos government raised almost pound billion from oil and gas revenues compared to the pound million attributed to Scotland, which is a lasting testament to Westminsterrsquos mismanagement and over-generous tax allowances.Unless we take the opportunity to change things with self-government, Scotlandrsquos fiscal position will only get worse after Brexit as the UK, despite consistently failing to balance its books, faces a decade of austerity.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh EH.IT would appear that Jill Stephensonis content to sponge off the taxpayers of the southeast of England. What a shameful position for anyone to take, either in a personal capacity or as a Scot.Scotlands economy has suffered a succession of catastrophic impacts at the hands of a succession of right-wing ideologically-driven governments, starting with Margaret Thatchers scrapping of Scotlands industrial capacity in the s, through the financial disaster of  and culminating with Brexit in . The fact that oil from Scotlands territory subsidised the de-industrialisation of the s and then supported the expansion of the City of Londons financial sector only underlines the irony of the position held by Ms Stephenson.Scotland will have the freedom to grow its economy only when it is free of interference by Westminster. The next catastrophe, of course, is going to be Brexit. Scotlands population has expanded steadily since ,, but that growth will stall as soon as Westminster is able to deny the immigration we need here. Scotlands GDP is considerably smaller than near neighbours with similar populations such as Norway, Denmark, Ireland and Finland, the reason for that is that these small independent countries can tailor their economies to their needs, not the needs of the city of London and the South East of England.Scotland doesnt need nuclear submarines, aircraft carriersor global military reach, all of which cost a lot more than the pound. billion that Ms Stephenson claims, but we do need infrastructure, health care, education and above all people to grow our economy.The GERS figures may seem to be a godsend to people who think like Ms Stephenson, but all they really do is underline the structural failures and weakness of the United Kingdoms economy.John Jamieson, Ayr.IT is sad to say that some who would refer to themselves as Scots appear proud of the fact that under the current constitutional arrangements Scotland seems, at least on a superficial level, to be \"subsidised\" by the rest of the UK. Of course not only is this assessment distorted because Wales, Northern Ireland and the North of England are apparently more heavily dependent on the largesse of Londoners, but because only tax revenues directly attributable to Scotland are included in Scottish revenues raised while non-directly attributable expenditures, such as defence, are pro-rated by Westminster.Of course the deliberately conjured smoke and mirrors hide the slanted workings of the UK economy which leverages resources from outside of the south-east of England to maximise the financial growth of London. Scotland was effectively in surplus for most of the last four decades but not only was no oil wealth fund created for the benefit of future generations, Scotland did not even obtain close to a population proportion of the massive infrastructure spending in and around London, an economically debilitating relative predicament which is set to continue for the foreseeable future . The people of Scotland are just as capable as those of our southern neighbour, but we can only prosper in accordance with our collective talents when we can invest all our resources in our own country.Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.THE annual furore over the GERS figures is now in predictable full swing. No one has ever seriously uttered the popular grievance mantra of \"too poor, too smallrsquo with regards to Scotland.But this isnrsquot  any more. Oil prices have plummeted. Covid- is still playing out, in ways that cant be predicted. The global economy is reeling and climate instability is increasing.How much would an independent Scotland borrow, how would the deficit be dealt withincreased taxes or a reduction in services, or both. Or neither  How would Scotland be a competitive place for business The SNP needs to start tackling the \"known unknowns and \"unknown unknowns\" of Scottish independence with a rigorous hard factual honesty that it has yet to muster, lest we all vote for a st century version of the Darien Scheme at some point in the future.Surely the people of Scotland deserve better than the \"Nah, itll be fine\" attitude that the SNP have been peddling for six years now.David Bone, Girvan.YET again Ruth Marrtrots out the untruth that The Vow was forgotten by those who committed to it, so once again, it is necessary to refute that assertion.The Vow of September  was signed by Prime Minister David Cameron, Deputy PM Nick Clegg and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband and promised three things and three things only. These were: statutory protection for existence of the Scottish Parliament new extra powers for that Parliament and the preservation of the Barnett Formula. Of these, the first two were enacted in the Scotland Act  . The Barnett Formula also remains intact.Likewise, Ms Marrs claim that a No vote would guarantee EU membership is a distortion of the truth. What was in fact said was that a Yes vote would be a vote to leave the EU at the same time as Scotland left the UKndash which was based on the unambiguous opinion of the EU Commission as provided to the Scottish Parliament.Again the question must asked:Scottish independence is such a good thing, why do nationalists need to tell so many lies to convice the rest of us of their case Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.NICOLA Sturgeon in her daily briefing todaysaid that the Scottish Government has used the UK-wide Covid- testing system \"which allows us to deliver economies of scale, so it is the right approach to take\".

Asked to rate his performance, % said he was doing well, % badly and a whopping % were ldquodonrsquot know.To survive for so long without achievements, profile or prospects is, in its own small way, remarkable.But being Holyroodrsquos answer to moss wasnrsquot the objective.Mr Leonard is meant to be within striking distance of Bute House.After more than , days, itrsquos clear he never will be. He has had his chance and it hasnrsquot worked out. He is not a late bloomer but a dead bulb.Thatrsquos not to say hersquos a bad chap. He is manestly decent and sincere.At his best, he is one of the most commanding speakers at Holyrood.If he raises an injustice at FMQs, his solemn, unadorned phrases have an ability to silence MSPs and make ministers squirm in discomfort.However it is a patchy talent thatrsquos undone by the times he misfires horribly, as he did this week with a stale script and weak comebacks, and was shredded by Nicola Sturgeon.But his biggest problem is his failure to connect with the public. Too cosy talking shop within his own tribe - never get him started on trade union history - he hasnrsquot reached out widely enough to voters, hasnrsquot fought hard enough for their attention.Whatever the message, it needs the right messenger to be heard.As one party source told me more in sorrow than anger: ldquoHersquos making no impact whatsoever.

Douglas Ross has a better chance of building a fresh team around him than Mr Carlaw ever did.I ask you, who is going to sign up for the last days of Richard Leonard So it falls to Sir Keir to spruce up Scottish Labour in the spring, offering a dferent anti-Tory vote to the SNP.It may not make much dference, but this early in his leadership he can afford to throw himself into the fray and take a few lumps, and therersquos no credit in ducking the fight.Thatrsquos the Prime Ministerrsquos modus operandi north of the border.All is not lost for Scottish Labour however.

But the Scottish Government is currently not just in danger of being excessively secretive, but of making itself absurd through its refusal to provide the public with answers to basic questions.The question of when the First Minister first knew that people positive with coronavirus were being discharged into care homes is a matter of urgent public interest. It is not one that compromises the privacy of inidual patients or impinges on the Governmentrsquos ability to make the best decisions. Nor should it be one that requires her to obtain details from Public Health Scotland it is inconceivable that she does not know the answer. She is simply refusing to give it.The assumption must be that it is one that doesnrsquot show her and the Government in the best light. But the refusal to answer is worse than simply admitting as much. Scots are well aware that government is not infallible, and this Government in particular has been afforded a generous degree of latitude for its mistakes. In part, that may be due to the reasonable and realistic recognition of this fact that it presents in its rhetoric.That counts for nothing, however, when its responses ndash or refusals to respond ndash fail to correspond with those public statements. There has been an alarming pattern of behaviour on this front. To take just a few instances, there has been the Queen Elizabeth Hospital inquiry, the reluctance to publish minutes of ministerial meetings, delays to routine Freedom of Information requests, an attempt to sneak out an ICEA report critical of education policy, Audit Scotlandrsquos damning assessment of secrecy surrounding PFI projects, the disgraceful evasion over the role of government and public officials in the inquiry into Alex Salmond ndash after assurances that all such material would be forthcoming ndash and now the ludicrous claim that an effective reaction to the Covid emergency would be constrained by the answer to a simple question about when the Government knew what.All of these obfuscations give little reason for public confidence that an inquiry into coronavirus policy, when it finally comes, will uncover the full picture. The Government gives lip service to statements about how mistakes will undoubtedly have been made it makes glib pronouncements about how important it will be to identy them, and ensure that lessons are learnt so that they are not repeated.But the reality is that it goes to enormous s ndash and often, when the courts are involved, enormous cost to the public purse ndash to avoid answering such questions, far less admit its own failings. That is an unhealthy attitude, corrosive of public confidence and damaging to good governance.Whatrsquos more, given that the electorate is composed of grown-ups and, on current showings, far from censorious, it is a politically foolish and counterproductive one. There are relatively few legitimate reasons, generally to do with security concerns or momentous economic decisions likely to move markets, for government business to be conducted privately. Potential embarrassment to the SNP is not one.The expectation should be that frank disclosure is the norm it benefits the Government by making them seem like fair dealers, it improves policy decisions for the future and, above all, it is a reminder that the public has a right to know, and that politicians should be the peoplersquos servants, rather than the reverse."},{"url":null,"title":"seven-areas-scotland-curbed-house-sales-inquiries-decrease","story":"The study by WeBuyAnyHome puts in perspective how each location has seen house sales inquiries change with the level of Covid- cases registered in the area.With only a % decrease in house sales demand compared to last year and most of the UK regions with an increase in house sales inquiries located in Scotland, the Scottish property market shows more hopeful figures than the rest of the Nation. .:Home in Largs: Flat in popular seaside town could be yours for poundKHere are the Scottish regions with an increase in house sale inquiries :Dundee and Shetland Isles are the Scottish locations most affected with an average decrease of -% and -% respectively.Here are theScottish regions with the highest decrease in house sale inquiries :: Where is the most expensive place to buy a house in Scotland Mark Irwin, Marketing Director at WeBuyAnyHome stated: \"The property market, indeed the economy as a whole, has never seen anything like this before - any person making claims to know what will happen next and when, would likely be using guesswork as much as the layman would.\"However, interpreting these figures, we might expect the current bubbleto last until November, with economic struggles then causing a drop in values by approx.\"%, with it felt more acutely in lower value properties that donrsquot benefit from the stamp duty reduction, and as they tend to belong to lower paid workers who may be more susceptible to job losses and sadly being forced to sell.\"That is our current working assumption, but things are changing all the time.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-football-fans-set-september-return-pilot-scheme-date-announced","story":"The Scottish Government rejected a proposal from Celtic that would have seen a limited number of supporters attend their fixture with Motherwell this weekend.But the Joint Response Group have now confirmed that three games could be used as test events on Saturday, September .Rod Petrie, Joint Response Group Chair said: ldquoThis is a welcome and positive development for Scottish football, as the national sport, to build on the sporting pilot taking place at BT Murrayfield this evening.ldquoWe have already written to clubs to obtain their Return to Supporting plans specic to each stadium and will now follow-up with those clubs able to participate in the initial pilot on  September.If successful, these trial fixtureswould be part of a phasedof fans to stadia in the weeks following.TheJRG will liaise with Premiership clubs to finalise arrangements in the coming days.Neil Doncaster, SPFL Chief Executive said: ldquoClubs have worked tirelessly to ensure football couldsafely at the start of this month and news that fans will be allowed in, albeit in restricted numbers, within a matter of weeks is hugely encouraging.ldquoWe look forward to liaising with government to build on the sporting pilot at BT Murrayfield and to provide the necessary support to clubs to facilitate the eagerly awaitedof fans who - now more than ever before ndash are the leblood of our game.\""},{"url":null,"title":"economic-storm-blame-game","story":"The Ross Clark remembers the Thursday nights when everyone gathered on their doorsteps to applaud the NHS workers risking their lives.ldquoThey were putting their own safety aside to work in close proximity with people who were desperately ill with the virus and were coughing it out in copious quantities, he said. ldquoCompared with the risks run by frontline nurses and doctors at the height of the epidemic in March and April the dangers faced by office workers now are miniscule.He asked why so many workers have not ed to the office, pointing out that, in London, just  per cent are back at work.ldquoYou have to wonder what has happened to the nationrsquos productivity given that millions of people used to an office environment suddenly work from home, away from the eyes of their bosses, he said. ldquoProductivity in many organisations has not exactly been impressive since staff started working from home.

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

For the overwhelming majority that means entry to the Ballymena Academy Sixth Form whilst others will prefer a dferent route regardless of their choice, we extend our best wishes to all.”High AchieversFive young people achieved  A* grades – Christian Drennan, Chloe Logan, William McCartney, Katy McLean and Eabha Steele. pupils achieved a minimum of  A* A grades – Callum Anderson, Ross Barr, Alex Bonar, Andrew Boyd, Aaron Craig, Chloe Cotton, Paul Cunningham, James Currie, Katherine Duff, Alex Hamill, Finn Henderson, Amy Houston, Lois Kirkpatrick, Christopher Leitch, Megan Logan, Connor Louw, Lucy Magee, Evie Magill, Erin Marrs.

Clare Cushenan started Special Delivery NI last year.She brings gt baskets packed with items for mum and baby to hospitals for new mothers - along with positive and reassuring information about Down Syndrome.And now she is seeking help from retailers and the public to ensure the caring project goes from strength to strength.Clare explains: “I started Special Delivery NI because when my third child, Aoe, was bornI was given her Down Syndrome diagnosis shortly after her birth.“I was shocked and didn’t know what le with a child who was ‘dferent’ would be like. “How would this affect my family  Would she be able to go to school with her older brother and sister  How would we cope with this ”Clare says she was given lots of leaflets on Down Syndrome which seemed to concentrate on all the ious the health concerns people with DS might face. She added: “It appeared to have her le mapped out. It was overwhelming and unfortunately mainly negative, slanted towards the worst case scenario. The midwives though very kind didn’t alleviate any of my fears - but how could they  “They had no frame of reference, just a memory of the last woman who had a baby with Down syndrome and left with the myriad of leaflets.”Clare remains determined that no mother and family who have a baby with Down syndrome will leavehospital feeling as she did.“I have to leave the boxes in the maternity units and the midwives ask the mothershe wants one. I want them to hear ‘congratulations your baby is perfect’ because they are. “All our worries and concern about Aoe’s future were unfounded. We have a typical family le. “Yes Aoe takes longer to achieve her developmental milestones but she does achieve them. She has taught us all about patience and determination.“The gt baskets contain positive information about Down syndrome. They include a ‘Wouldn’t Change A Thing’ book which seeks to portray the true stories of positive, lived experience typical of the majority of real people with Down syndrome and their families. “There is a letter from me congratulating the new mum and basically saying it is overwhelming but it will be fine - actually better than fine, amazing! And of course the items for baby and items for mum. “I need help from shops and retailers and iniduals, financiallyand also through donating items suitable for the gt baskets.”To find out more and for links to the fund-raising page simply go to the Special Delivery NI page on Facebook.

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA mum whose son was traumatised after being left alone in a room by his teachers wants the department to bring in minimum standards for Covid isolation in schools. Jessica BlackAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA mum whose son was traumatised after being left alone in a room by his teachers wants the department to bring in minimum standards for Covid isolation in schools.Current guidance requires children who show coronavirus symptoms to be taken from class and put in a room behind a closed door until they can be collected - but there are no restrictions on how these spaces are set up.Earlier this week a school in the Republic of Ireland was reported to have set aside a garden shed for kids to self isolate.The Co Tyrone woman, who asked for her name not to be used, said the practice should be standardised to protect pupils.Her son has become terried of being left alone after he was repeatedly taken from his classroom and left behind a locked door at his former school. The mum-of-two added: As a parent who has navigated a child through this pre-Covid I am aware of the seriousness of this issue.We had to remove doors from the house. He only recently got the bedroom door put back on his room but we can#t close it.The minimum should be a standard size, access to water and a window for ventilation.One child#s experience should not dfer from another due to #lack of space#. The Department of Educationhas previously updated its guidance to require adult supervision, and for schools to keep a record of whenever a child is isolated.Children#s Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma welcomed the changes made so far - but said more clarity was needed.She also wants ventilation to be mandatory - instead of ideal, as the current guidance says.She added: I recognise iations in physical capacity and space across schools, however, emphasise the need for a consistent approach to be taken by schools when separating isolating symptomatic children until they are collected by a parent and that ventilation should be provided.A DoE spokeswoman said guidance was based on public health advice.It states: A child awaiting collection should be moved,possible, to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door. Appropriate adult supervision must be provided. Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation.She added: This allows schools the flexibility to manage cases as they arise on their sites, without being overly prescriptive. The Department will continue to keep the guidance under review, working closely with the sector.Department of Education guidance states: A ventilated space should be available for pupils  staff who become symptomatic to wait in until they can be collected or safely get home. Education settings may wish to draw on the broad principles illustrated in these examples to help inform bespoke local solutions. There should be no restriction on how spaces are configured to best support the educational needs of learners whilst adhering to social distancing requirements. Education settings will be best placed to consider the right approach for their own inidual circumstances.A child awaiting collection should be moved,possible, to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door. Appropriate adult supervision must be provided.Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation. If it is not possible to fully isolate the child, they should be moved to an area which is at least m away from other people.A risk assessment should be undertaken by the school to address this.Schools should fully document this process to ensure a record is held of who made the decision, who was contacted, who provided supervision and who picked up the child.Belfast Most ReadShock as popular businessman Raymond Turkington dies in Co Tyrone crashPSNI issues nine prohibition notices to pubs breaching coronavirus guidelinesCoronavirus: Northern Ireland records more than , positive Covid- cases, just six months after first caseMuch-loved Park Avenue Hotel that once hosted Arnold Schwarzenegger closes its doorsEamonn Holmes faces criticism over #Rule Britannia# slavery debate,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tony Stevens has come out of retirement to take up the post of interim chief executive of the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authorityfollowing the departure of Dermot Parsons. It comes after it emerged Mr Parsons threatened to resign from the top post at the height of the Covid- pandemic, claiming the Board of the RQIA had no confidence in his ability. Mr Parsons wrote to the Chief Medical OfficerMichael McBride in May stating he felt his position was untenable after the RQIA Board raised concerns over the decision to scale back care home visits during the pandemic. The board also expressed concerns about the redeployment of a number of RQIA#s senior executive team with critical loss of experience in the months before Mr Parsons was appointed interim chief executive. The row culminated in the mass resignation of the RQIA Board. The RQIA is the body tasked with ensuring healthcare providers such as hospitals and care homes meet minimum safety standards. A spokesman from the RQIA refused to say whether Mr Parsons remains with the organisation or provide an explanation for him stepping down as interim chief executive.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDermot Parsons FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDermot ParsonsHowever, Christine Collins, interim chair of the RQIA Board, said: I am delighted that Dr Stevens has agreed to take up post of interim chief executive at the RQIA on September . Dr Stevens brings considerable leadership experience and knowledge of the health and social care system, which will be invaluable as we reinforce and reshape the RQIA to face current and future challenges. Meanwhile, Dr Stevens said: I am pleased to be joining the experienced and dedicated team at RQIA at this challenging time for health and social care and the wider community. I look forward to leading RQIA in assuring the quality and safety of the health and social care services that people experience, and responding to the particular challenges that the current pandemic presents. Mr Stevens is the third person to be appointed as chief executive of the RQIA in six months. Olive Macleod stepped down as chief executive in March this year to take up the top job at the Public Health Agency. She was replaced by Mr Parsons who has now also left the job. The performance of the RQIA has come under the spotlight in recent years. It came under fire following a damning investigation into conditions at a care home in Dunmurry, which is currently at the centre of a police investigation. The Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland expressed concerns that the RQIA did not act quickly enough to protect residents at Dunmurry Manor, which has since been renamed Oak Tree Manor. And in June this year, Mr Parsons came under pressure to explain why he told the Stormont health committee in May that the RQIA was in agreement with a direction from the Department of Health to reduce care home inspections. In response to the question on the issue from chair Colm Gildernew, Mr Parsons said: Our approach towards that was agreement. However, in an email sent to CMO Dr Michael McBride on April , Mr Parsons referred to an appearance of a fundamental dference of approach between that promoted by the CMO, chief social worker and RQIA executive team members, and that upheld by the RQIA board. He continued: I would also be grateful for your urgent advice as I believe that my position as interim chief executive in RQIA may be untenable... I am content to step out of this roleit will help resolve this dilemma.In an email sent to Dr McBride on May , Mr Parsons reiterated a desire to resign: It is clear that RQIA Board does not have confidence in my performance in this role... I am unsure as to with whom I should discuss resignation... unfortunately I now believe my position is untenable.

There has been talk today about drive-through vaccinations andI do think this is the sort of infrastructure that we#re going to have to be looking at to deliver this in order to ensure there is the maximum uptake.Not everyone is going to feel safe about going into a clinical setting at the moment, so perhaps that will be more acceptable to people.On encouraging more front line health workers to get the flu jab, he added: Obviously the worry for them will be the impact of a potential second wave of coronavirus.So we need to make sure more people aren#t being sick for regular reasons, enabling them to be fully al to fight any second wave.It#s also vital they don#t have a lower immune system when working in clinical settings.On the scale of the challenge, he said: It#s no small obstacle, in Northern Ireland we#re looking at trying to get close to two million people immunised.So we will need large-scale, almost medical camps set up in places to access the vaccine. In a way it will also be a practice run for when we hopefully do get a Covid- vaccine.Mr McGrath said the fast response earlier this year to setting up a Nightingale hospital in Belfast was an encouraging sign.He added: When we put our minds to it I#m very sure that we can achieve massive things.I#ve every faith we can do that but we would certainly want to see evidence that we#re progressing towards that quickly.This week, experts have also warned that complacency over the flu jab could risk overwhelming the NHS across the United Kingdom.Analysis showed a decline among vulnerable groups in England to getting the vaccine.Local authorities in England had an average of % of people with serious health conditions under  getting the jab, a % drop since . In Northern Ireland the respective figure for vulnerable groups under- was % - the target here is %.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this week: The vaccine is more vital than ever.Belfast Most ReadShock as popular businessman Raymond Turkington dies in Co Tyrone crashPSNI issues nine prohibition notices to pubs breaching coronavirus guidelinesCoronavirus: Northern Ireland records more than , positive Covid- cases, just six months after first caseMuch-loved Park Avenue Hotel that once hosted Arnold Schwarzenegger closes its doorsEamonn Holmes faces criticism over #Rule Britannia# slavery debate,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In the current situation I just didn#t feel comfortable about creating an event in Newcastle that would attract hundreds of people so I#ve had to be resourceful and creative, Adrian explained. Instead I#ve covered the walls of our home in Portstewart with my artwork and filmed it to create a virtual walk through tour of the exhibition. This will be available to view on my Facebook page over the weekend and it will showcase my work in a domestic setting to illustrate to those who normally buy it how it would look in their own homes. I#ll also have a Facebook shop set up with dimensions and prices of the artwork in the video tour which features depictions the north coast, the Mournes, Belfast and Donegal. Known for his contemporary depictions of iconic Irish landscapes, landmarks and musical traditions using bold colour, strong shapes and expressive textures, Adrian#s striking work has taken the art market in Northern Ireland by storm in recent years. Like many Adrian saw his original plans for  thrown into disarray due to the Covid- pandemic with ious exhibitions and workshops cancelled. During lockdown, he reached out to thousands of children by offering free weekly online art classes as part of their home-schooling experience. Adrian ran painting demonstrations on his Facebook page every Friday to demonstrate his dferent styles and techniques.As someone who would normally be out on the road a lot doing exhibitions, I was missing that interaction with people, he said. I started thinking of all the parents out there who would be struggling to think of ways of continuing to inspire and stimulate young minds and the idea of a virtual art class on Fridays stemmed from that. At a time when many may have been feeling isolated, it kept me both busy and connected and it was good to get the feedback.Lockdown has meant dferent things to dferent people. For me it has made me slow down and truly appreciate those places that bring me joy and fill me with wonder, he added.To give the pupils something to look forward to post-Covid, Adrian encouraged those who joined his online class to take part in a collaborative project.The participants worked on inidual paintings of their favourite places on hexagonal shapes pieces of card.Adrian is planning to bring all the works together to create one large art piece for public display.His Summer  Collection is live from am today until Monday on the Adrian Margey Art Facebook page. Adrian#s Portrush Studio has also reopened to the public at weekends.

Pat Cullen, director of the RCN NI, who warned in June that nurses couldto the picket line after holding strikes earlier this year for increased pay and better conditions, said wages for the profession must be attractive to secure safe nursing levels.Nurses in Northern Ireland are only too aware of the impact of not having enough nurses to care for patients, she said. This is why they took the dficult decision to take industrial action earlier this year and why we fought so hard for the guarantee that safe nurse staffing legislation would be implemented here.The union chief continued: We need to ensure that nursing remains an attractive profession and that we are training and retaining the right numbers of nurses in order to do this. The public have made it clear that they value the profession - we must ensure their pay reflects this. Dame Donna Kinnair, RCN chief executive and general secretary, insisted the campaign is about recognising the skill, experience and responsibility shown by all members of the nursing profession. This is about more than the profession#s response to Covid- - it is about increasing the attractiveness of the profession, to fill tens of thousands of unfilled nursing jobs and reach safe staffing levels. It is time to pay nursing staff fairly, she said.Meanwhile, Graham Revie, chair of the RCN#s trade union committee, said the pay demand reflects the knowledge, skills and responsibilities of the complex job we do. RCN members have told us they expect things to change, and we will fight for that change. The RCN is its members and together we can achieve fair pay for nursing, he said.Nursing... has been underfunded, understaffed and undervalued.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate. Anyone who is in need of help or support with addiction can contact Cuan Mhuire by phone on  or via email – newry@cuanmhuire.ie  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate.

The colleges smart new unorm includes a blazer and jumper piped in gold which can be worn with a skirt or trousers. School principal, Martine Mulhern, said the new look came about after pupils said they wanted to be able to decide which they wanted to wear. A lot of the girls prefer to wear a skirt, but they said other pupils should have the choicethey want to wear trousers, she said. The whole idea of respecting other peoples choices is very important. googletag.cmd.push Last year the school council surveyed the pupils who voted overwhelmingly in favour of introducing a trouser option. This led to a long process of designing the new unorm, with the pupils allowed their say in how it should look and feel. The conversation started with Hunters Apparel in Derry who gave us dferent designs and that solid groundwork allowed us to get to the place where we are today, said Mrs Mulhern. The girls were so mature and insightful throughout it all. They knew and understood that there were certain things we couldnt do, but it was so important they felt comfortable. googletag.cmd.push There were a few prototypes before we got to the finished designs, but everyone is delighted with them. They are all loving the new blazer because its very smart and really brightens things up, and a surprising number of them have decided to take the option of wearing trousers. StCecilias worked closely with local unorm suppliers Max Fashions and Select Kidz to keep the cost of the new unorm, which has been adopted by the new intake, down. There will be a gradual phasing out of the old unorm over the coming years. The girls are loving the new unorm and as a school community we are so proud of them for taking the lead, added Mrs Mulhern. The children always come first and we have to listen to them. It was the right thing to do.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mrs Patricia Herron, Music Co-ordinator at St Eoghans Primary School, Draperstown, has watched Daras talent grow and develop from an early age. “He was maybe P or P when I realised that there might be a little voice in there that needs to be heard,” she told the County Derry Post. “The routine in our school would be that I askany children want to have a go at auditioning for a solo piece, so Dara would come up to the piano and this beautul, soft, quiet voice would come out. googletag.cmd.push “He sang solo at ious religious ceremonies as well, but it was really towards the end of P when his voice was developing so much more. “He was using a lot of ornamentation and trills and it came to light when he was singing an Irish song, with the traditional voice.” It was while singing an Irish song at his primary school show that the wider community began to take notice of the -year-olds phenomenal talent. Patricia recalled the moment his mum, Donna, was overcome with emotion watching her son hold an audience spellbound. “At that concert, when Dara sang the Irish song, I was sitting behind Donna,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “He hadnt sang it for his mammy purposely, and Donna just turned around and looked at me, and I looked at her, and there were tears in her eyes.

Even when I watch him on The Voice, hes always worried about everybody ,” she said. Pupils and staff at his former primary school, St Eoghans, beside a poster in support of Dara McNicholl “His voice is an absolute gt, and a gt that he must share with the world, because anybody Ive spoken to just wishes him so much luck. “Behind that is a lovely young man, and we wish him all the best. Hes very grounded and so are his family.” Daras exploits in The Voice Kids competition have enthused pupils and staff alike at a school where they take performance and the wholistic view of the child seriously. “In St Eoghans, we place a lot of importance on performing, and getting to know childrens talents, discover what they are and develop them,” said Mrs Herron. “Some schools think nowadays that concerts and opportunities to perform take away from learning time, but that is when you learn things like resilience, self-confidence and self-esteem. “The children from this area seem to be very musical and its an important part of our school, but Dara is such an inspiration. “From Primary  right up to Pimary , and indeed the staff, they just want to be like Dara. Any chance to sing now in school, Ill have a line of about a hundred children waiting to audition for a solo part!” After securing his place in the final with a beautul rendition of Sineacutead OConnors Nothing Compares  U on Saturday, Dara will take on fellow contestants George Elliott, Victoria Alsina and Justine Afante in the final. Coach Paloma Faith described his voice at the weekend as one of pure beauty and his primary school music teacher agrees. “To see a young child come in in P, get to be such an amazing singer by the time he leaves school, and then to excel and develop, I just cant wait to see what the future holds for him,” she said. “I heard him in an interview, and one of the lines he used was, I just want people to listen to my voice. “Now people have heard it and theyre sitting up, waiting to hear what comes next.” You can watch Dara in the final of the The Voice Kids this Saturday, August , at .pm on ITV.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is understood that the mystery vessel was bought for pound with the unknown owner planning to convert it into an Airbnb boat.  Foyle Search and Rescue , the police and other relevant agencies responded to reports of the boat being stuck on Sunday when they offered the crew assistance. The vessel, Day Dawn N , was last known to be engaged in fishing. according to the Marine Traffic website. Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bark n Baths in the Springtown Industrial Estate has four dog washing stations equipped with a professional shower and dryer and specially formulated sham- poos and conditioners.  Co-owner Garaidh Tomas Grfiths said the idea came about after many dog owners had to start washing their own pets during lockdown. “All the dog groomers had to close but they were sharing videos online to show people how to wash and brush their dogs coat themselves, said Mr Grfiths. People had no choice but to do it for themselves, but they were bent over their bath and giving themselves a bad back. googletag.cmd.push Then they had to chase a wet dog around the house to try and dry them before they got that wet dog smell and after all that they had to spend another half an hour cleaning their bath so it could be used by the rest of the family again. Mr Grfiths, who also owns the Canine Lodge doggie day care, hit on the idea of opening a self service dog washing salon. “After lockdown people are looking to save as much money as possible and we are able to offer people the chance to wash their dog from as little as pound. googletag.cmd.push “Its great for people who have taken their dog to the beach or a country park and want to give them a quick wash and get rid of any sand or muck. Every station at Barks n Baths is set up with an industrial shower and dryer, highly absorbent towels, and PH balanced dog shampoo and conditioner and disposable aprons and gloves. A dogs PH level is dferent to a human so using the wrong product can affect their skin, coat and overall health, said Mr Grfiths If we can help someone maintain their dogs health we are happy to do it. A  minute session will cost pound and the price goes up from there to pound for  minutes, pound for  minutes and pound for an hour which would be long enough to wash and dry a big dog with long hair. There is also a private bay for dogs that may be anxious or anti-social. The private bay is partitioned off and has its own entrance so it is perfect for dogs that are nervous or aggressive around other dogs or people, added Mr Grfiths. We have had people come to us who have been told their dog isnt suitable to go to a groomer, so they are delighted this service is here. Bark n Baths is located at Site , Unit  in the Springtown Industrial Estate close to Cable  Accessories.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bark n Baths in the Springtown Industrial Estate has four dog washing stations equipped with a professional shower and dryer and specially formulated sham- poos and conditioners.  Co-owner Garaidh Tomas Grfiths said the idea came about after many dog owners had to start washing their own pets during lockdown. “All the dog groomers had to close but they were sharing videos online to show people how to wash and brush their dogs coat themselves, said Mr Grfiths. People had no choice but to do it for themselves, but they were bent over their bath and giving themselves a bad back. googletag.cmd.push Then they had to chase a wet dog around the house to try and dry them before they got that wet dog smell and after all that they had to spend another half an hour cleaning their bath so it could be used by the rest of the family again. Mr Grfiths, who also owns the Canine Lodge doggie day care, hit on the idea of opening a self service dog washing salon. “After lockdown people are looking to save as much money as possible and we are able to offer people the chance to wash their dog from as little as pound. googletag.cmd.push “Its great for people who have taken their dog to the beach or a country park and want to give them a quick wash and get rid of any sand or muck. Every station at Barks n Baths is set up with an industrial shower and dryer, highly absorbent towels, and PH balanced dog shampoo and conditioner and disposable aprons and gloves. A dogs PH level is dferent to a human so using the wrong product can affect their skin, coat and overall health, said Mr Grfiths If we can help someone maintain their dogs health we are happy to do it. A  minute session will cost pound and the price goes up from there to pound for  minutes, pound for  minutes and pound for an hour which would be long enough to wash and dry a big dog with long hair. There is also a private bay for dogs that may be anxious or anti-social. The private bay is partitioned off and has its own entrance so it is perfect for dogs that are nervous or aggressive around other dogs or people, added Mr Grfiths. We have had people come to us who have been told their dog isnt suitable to go to a groomer, so they are delighted this service is here. Bark n Baths is located at Site , Unit  in the Springtown Industrial Estate close to Cable  Accessories.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with.

The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago.

On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He took trains from Milan to Torino, and then up the Susa Valley and around six hours later he was installed in Susa where it was  degrees.Race day dawned without a cloud in the sky and with the temperature already soaring, Hanna joined the front row of the grid designed for social distancing wearing his mask. The mask was obligatory for the first m. Hanna tucked into a front bunch that was a whorsquos who of Italian mountain racing. Hanna covered the first mile in :, and then at km the race became steep. He climbed well, as ever, encountering a dficult patch around the middle and then at about .km he spotted Baldaccini ahead of him, a past winner in  and .By now Hanna was in tenth place and with his climbing legs feeling good again set about moving up the field. He caught Baldaccini and kept pushing and on to the final k, with  flats and true flats at over , feet altitude, Hanna surged to cross the line in a brilliant eighth place.In the process he had taken the scalps of, not just the former winner of the race Baldaccini, but also Puppi, who had taken second place in last yearrsquos World Long-Distance Mountain Racing Championships, and Bernard Dematteis, the former European mountain racing champion.At Down Royal on Saturday, the sound of hi-tec racing flats reverberated around the horse racing turf as the ChampionChip Ireland Road Race Series continued following its event at Eikon, Balmoral, three weeks ago.It was only August , but could easily have been mistaken for late autumn as the blustery conditions from the remnants of tropical Storm Ellen continued to cause havoc in the quest for personal bests.It was a testament to the consistent running many had done during lockdown and throughout the winter before that there were many personal bests achieved.First up was the km, won by Mourne man Andrew Annett in : in a sprint finish with Annadalersquos Eskander Turki .

At that stage, Bryansford had work to do with Clonduff leading - to -.Charlie Carr split the posts for Clonduff with a superbly taken score. Aidan Carr also got in on the act scoring a minor from play and Stephen McConville got his name on the scoresheet.Aidan Carr added another point and on  minutes the lead was extended further when Arthur McConville landed a big free to make it - to -.Bryansford needed something to steady the ship and they managed it on  minutes, getting their first score on the board when a free from Cathal Burns cut the gap to four points.Clonduff, however, were in no mood to get a case of the jitters and indeed stretched their lead to - to - when, in the th minute, firstly Tom Close got the better of his marker to break free to land another score, and then moments later, Barry OrsquoHagan did likewise.Bryansford were in need of some kind of encouragement and Danny Savage provided it on  minutes when he landed a free.Darren OrsquoHagan however went up the field and confidently steered between the posts to put Clonduff - to - ahead at the half-time interval.Early in the second period, Clonduff kept the foot on the gas to flatten the Bryansford spirit even more.Paddy Brannigan engineered just enough space for himself to punt the ball over Mark Reidrsquos crossbar.And then on  minutes it was - to - when Aidan Carr capitalised on space in the lsquoFord defence to leave Clonduff in the box seat.Clonduff were finding space more and more easy to come by and from a free after five minutes Stephen McConville made it - to -.Bryansford remained honest in the battle and made their third impression on the scoreboard when David McKenna pointed on  minutes.Clonduffrsquos machine was starting to purr productively and they rolled the scoreboard over once more ten minutes after the resumption when Stephen McConville knocked the ball over from play.The sides swapped scores on the -minute mark of the contest when David McKibbin made another minor from a free for lsquoFord, but Stephen McConville pointed for Clonduff to make it - to -.Fintan Canavan scored Bryansfordrsquos fth point before Stephen McConville responded in kind to again leave a nine-point cushion between them.The final minor before the next water break though went the way of Bryansford, Timmy Hanna notching it to make it - to -.In the th minute of the contest, Cathal Burns pointed Bryansfordrsquos seventh point. Savage kept pushing lsquoFord forward, using his experience to encourage those around him, and he knocked over their eighth score of the contest.Barely  seconds later it was Savage again scoring to give lsquoFord some real hope. That set up something of a tense finish to the contest when it had looked like it would be anything but.Twenty four minutes into the second half, Savage again was the commander-in-chief of the counter-offensive, making it three points in a row for Bryansford to cut the scoreline to - to -.A free gave Bryansford and Savage the chance to leave just a goal between the sides, and he made no mistakes, confidently floating his effort between the sticks, continuing his spell as a one-man danger to Clonduffrsquos superiority.However, as the clock began to become the enemy of lsquoFord, Clonduffrsquos Tom Close pointed from play to give Clonduff that crucial lead of four ahead again.Cathal Burns curled a neat point over the bar for Bryansford going into injury time to make it - to -.Then came a moment to stun Clonduff when Bryansford found a goal. Conor Maginn pumped the ball into the area and there was Timmy Hanna to palm it into the back of the net and force the game into extra time.The first ten-minute period of was a cagey affair, with both sides understandably more keen to avoid mistakes than push forward too much.Seven minutes into the first period, the first score was registered by Savage for Bryansford mdash it was the only score of that first spell.In the first minute of the second period Stephen McConville sent over a free, his seventh point of the afternoon. And when Barry OrsquoHagan pointed a moment later, Clonduff edged ahead by a point.That was clawed back again though when, eight minutes into the second period, Peter Brannigan equalised to leave the score - to -.Brannigan, however, was to make an even bigger splash just when this game seemed to have given you everything in twists and turns.He cashed in on a tiring Clonduff defence and fired beyond beyond the flailing efforts of goalkeeper Neil Trainor for a goal, to the delight of the lsquoFord contingent.

Like Pantridge, after the war he could neither forgive nor forget and had a burning hatred of the Japanese.During his time in captivity, Pantridge suffered badly from malnutrition, beri beri and other illnesses. Following the Japanese surrender he weighed less than five stone and was a physical wreck.On ing home to Northern Ireland in October  he was still very weak, but was determined to resume his medical career, getting a housemanrsquos position at the Royal Victoria Hospital.Because of his experiences in the POW camps, he decided to specialise in heart medicine. He became a consultant physician and cardiologist at the RVH before inventing the portable defibrillator in the s.Pantridge had become convinced that a patient might be savedan electric shock was applied to the chest as soon as possible after a cardiac arrest. There were defibrillators in hospitals, but they were too big and bulky to be taken outside.Along with others he set out to make a defibrillator small enough to fit inside an ambulance. In  the first ambulance with a defibrillator was operating in Northern Ireland, making the province one of the safest places in the world to have a heart attack.The mobile defibrillator was used to treat US President Lyndon Johnson when he suffered a heart attack in .Although he was known worldwide as the lsquoFather of Emergency Medicinersquo Pantridge was less acclaimed in his own country, and was saddened that it took until  for all front-line ambulances in the UK to be fitted with defibrillators.He had retired in  and died on December , , aged . A bronze statue of him stands outside Lisburnrsquos civic centre as a timeless tribute to his achievements.Cecil Lowry says of Professor Pantridge: ldquoFrank was a man, whose talents and achievements were so extraordinary, that the further we consider his character, the more he will be remembered by the present generation with admiration and reverence.ldquoThis book has told the manrsquos story of incredible bravery in the face of overwhelming odds during the Second World War and his dedication to the concept of the portable defibrillator on his .

The way they have been treated is diabolical, he declared.Cllr Boyle said parents have raised their concerns with him, highlighting what their children experienced at the start of the new school term by having to wait to use the ferry.He also revealed that he became increasingly concerned when he highlighted the issue on social media and was told how children were being treated.Cllr Boyle said problems were compounded with the closure of the main Strangford to Downpatrick road to allow a number of trees to be pruned to allow double decker buses to use the route in future.ldquoMy main concern is that there was no prior notice in relation to the number of children who could board the ferry.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.The Strangford MLA added: ldquoThe local community previously stood together to save Exploris and will do so again. I would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time

He said the impact of the small building mdash redeveloped by the Parish Church mdash was expanding all the time.He added: ldquoI know that you will protect and encourage all that happens from there.Dean Hull paid tribute to Mr McDonaldrsquos contribution to not only Down and Hollymount churches but all those within the Lecale Area Mission Partnershipgroup.ldquoScott made a signicant contribution to LAMP and he and his family have been very much part of le here in Down and in Hollymount, also touching on the other churches within the group as well.ldquoScottrsquos ministry very much focused on Down Parish and Hollymount but he has influenced people in churches where and there are those who are sad that they cannot be with us this morning, the Dean continued.Praising Mr McDonald for launching Carols by the Lake and Blue Christmas initiatives, Dean Hull said the latter really touched those dealing with bereavement and loss and hopes that bothcontinue to feature on the church calendar.Mr Dorrian highlighted the key role played by Scott in forging relationships, referencing his work with the Pepper Johns Community Centre and establishing a link betweenHollymount Church and Hollymount Pipe Band. One of the bandrsquos members, Sam Gill, played at the end of Sundayrsquos service.Mr Telford described Sundayrsquos service as a ldquosad occasion as the congregation in Down Parish said goodbye to their minister who had touched all their lives.He said Mr McDonaldrsquos arrival in  ldquosparked renewed optimism within the church with the new man quickly making his mark, especially in relation to the Pepper Johns Community Centre which he helped deliver along with the board of trustees.He added: ldquoPerhaps the best tribute that can be paid to Scott is that he very soon became one of us and, deep down, I think he knows that he always will be. It was a hard decision for Scott and his family to make the move to Newry and it is important that while we are disappointed aboutthis, we support them and continue to do so.On behalf of Hollymount Church, Ms Blair said that Mr McDonald will be very much missed, praising him for his leadership and the ious initiatives that he spearheaded over the past four years.ldquoWe are all fond of Scott who was with us through thick and thin and ups and downs. No matter what, Scott was there, she said.Ms Blair added: ldquoWhile we are sorry to see him go, we wish Scott and his family all the best in Newry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th August 2020 Students.jpg","title":"Students celebrate GCSE results after ‘challenging year’  ","story":"IT was a dferent GCSE results day this year for local schools and students as the need to maintain social distancing measures was a key concern.As with the recent A-Level results, grades this year were predicted by teachers as examinations could not be held due to schools closure over the Covid- lockdown.Down High Schoolrsquos principal, Mrs Maud Perry, reported that  students collected their results from two designated venues in Downpatrick at dferent times with social distancing measures in place.Nearly % of all students achieved at least seven A* A grades while six pupils mdash Katie Dickson, Ellen Johnston, Cameron McCaughey, Lauren McCormick, Rosa Morgan-Young and Anna Torrens mdash all received ten A* grades while Lucy Healy and Tori Marks secured nine A* grades each.Mrs Perry paid tribute to the hard work of her pupils during such challenging times.ldquoThis was a lovely year group and we congratulate them on these outcomes, which provide a firm foundation for the next stage of their education.

Please try again later.Submitting...Mr McQuillian told Talkback that it was an “amazing” pay hike and he could find no reference to any comparable pay deal anywhere in the public sector in Northern Ireland.The change to the rules by MLAs will also mean an increase in expenses they can claim for their offices, mobile phones and multiple other areas of expenditure – which could total about £ million a year.People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said the decision was “absolutely wrong” and “is exactly this kind of ‘gravy train’ politics that has left many thousands of people disillusioned with Stormont”.TUV leader Jim Allister said that MLAs setting their own allowances “lacks the independent rigour the public rightly expects”.But independent MLA Jim Wells argued that the move merely put staff on to the same footing as civil servants who work in the Assembly.The Assembly told the News Letter that MLAs had examined other public sector roles – but not included the private sector, as Mr McQuillan’s  had done – when deciding to set the new staff salaries and the changes would “bring MLA staff into broad alignment with them”.Edwina Hegarty, a specialistinfectious diseases and microbiology registrar working in the NHS in Northern Ireland, told the News Letter that she was not knowledgeable about what MLAs’ staff do and so“what they’re worth is not for me to say”.However, she said that there was about seven years of work and vast expense involved before a doctor gets to be a registrar and that the nature of the job is that sometimes doctors will stay in work three hours after their finish time to care for a sick patient.Read More Read MoreMLAs vote to set their own expenses again – despite warning of potential for abuse________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Pictured are favourites Sue Gray and Peter MayIn a circular process, mandarins were then chosen by the Senior Appointments Selection Committee, a body itself made up of the most senior civil servants, each of whom was selected for the committee by the Head of the Civil Service, who was in turn advised by the committee.Jobs were neither applied for nor CVs reviewed, with the acerbic observation that “few senior officials have ever drawn up their own CVs or would know how to do so”.Despite criticism that such a situationwas untenable in a modern democracy, Plowden, an academic who was himself a former civil servant, said in his  book Ministers and Mandarins that it represented “a powerful symbol of the traditional civil service” which “reflects the confidence of the civil service as a profession in its own judgements about its own future and about the national interest, and about the congruence between the two”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...As with much of le in Northern Ireland, things here have always been slightly dferent.But until recently two broad elements of Plowden’s analysis of the Whitehall machine would have been largely analogous – civil servants had enormous power in choosing each other for the top posts, and that practice was a manestation of a government bureaucracy which was firmly self-confident.Where the confidence of Whitehall mandarins could be traced back to their predecessors who had run an empire, the confidence of Stormont’s officials had been forged in their knowledge thatit was the fledgling Northern Ireland Civil Service which – as much as the politicians of the Ulster Unionist Party – had built Northern Ireland and had been critical to sustaining it throughoutthe Troubles.For decades as Northern Ireland burned, as blood ran in the streets and as politicians proved incapable of finding workable governmental arrangements, it was the quiet bureaucrats of the Civil Service – as much as the military might of the Army, the resolve of the police or the restraining influence of churches – which held society together when it could have imploded into outright and uncontainable chaos.But now, on the eve of Northern Ireland’s centenary, the institution which in the years after  was central to making the new creation work when so many expected it to fail is now battered and a byword for irreformable ineptitude.The RHI scandal brought to view long-buried incompetence, along with new problems – officials’ limp subservience to their political masters’, a culture of deliberately not taking minutes or even recording who took major decisionsthey believed it might embarrass their ministers, and incompetence so extreme as to be scarcely believable.But as the chairman of the public inquiry into that scandal, Sir Patrick Coghlin, repeatedly noted during its hearings, many of the indefensible activities revealed by cash for ash had been raised time and time again by the Audit Office and the Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee, and assurances had been given by senior civil servants that “lessons will be learned”.They weren’t, and by failing to weed out incompetence in their ranks and speak truth to power, now Stormont’smandarins are greatly diminished – a collective punishment in which honourableand competent officials are now paying for the sins of their colleagues.The fact that in monetary terms not a single civil servant of any rank has yet lost a penny, much less their jobs, as a result of RHI does little to convince the public that this is an institution capable of holding itself to account .All of this is relevant because on Wednesday the first interviews of those who have applied to succeed David Sterling – who was implicated in the practices revealed by the RHI scandal – as Head of the Civil Service were conducted. According to a source, five internal candidates were interviewed – Sue Gray, Peter May, Richard Pengelly, DenisMcMahon, and Hugh Widdis – along with at least one external candidate.The identity of the external candidate or candidates remains unclear. Another source said that at least one senior DUP figure had wanted Francis Campbell, an Ulster-born former British diplomat who served as Ambassador to the Vatican, to apply for the post.The fact that Mr Campbell is a devout Catholic may make that seem surprising to those whose view of the DUP is as inflexiblysectarian party but it would in many ways be entirely logical – not only is the -year-old Rathfriland man a highly regarded bureaucrat and spoken of as a person of integrity, but the DUP has enthusiastically endorsed other senior appointments of Catholics, most notably that of John Larkin as Attorney General.It is unclear whether Mr Campbell – who earlier this year went to Australia to be vice chancellor of Notre Dame University – is even interested in the post, but the appointment of a Northern Ireland Catholic as head of the Civil Service would powerfully symbolise how this society has changed since .Until now, the Head of the Civil Service has – as in Whitehall – almost iniably been an internal promotion. But it is indicative of the shrunken authority of the civil service that internal candidates now probably begin with a handicap in a situation where the central requirement for the post will be to reform the institution.Multiple Stormont sources point to Department of Justice permanent secretary Peter May as the pre-eminent internal candidate and the closest to a continuity candidate of those most likely to get thejob.Department of Health permanent secretary Richard Pengelly is another strong and experienced candidate butthe fact that he is married to not only a senior DUP figure but one who is the special adviser to the First Minister in the department he would then lead is at least a complicating factor in a post requiring not just actual neutrality but the perception of neutrality.However, experienced Stormont figures largely agree that the clear favourite is Department of Finance permanent secretary Sue Gray.Despite that title, she is very much an outsider, having suddenly and unexpectedly arrived months after the RHI Inquiry had begun to reveal Stormont’s entrails and to some shrewd observers it appeared that Whitehall was putting one of its most senior figures in the Stormont department which controls the budget at a time when the culture of ‘free money’ was being laid bare.In person, she is warm and unstuffily personable, a sort of bureaucratic Mo Mowlam unwilling to accept conventionit cannot be cogently defended.To some, she is therefore a crusading reformer belatedly bringing reluctant officials into the st century and they see the fact that she has unsettled some of her new colleagues as evidence of that.But to others, her words too often don’t match her actions – especially around the secrecy which has long surrounded how she operates, a major problemshe is the person to reform a civil service whose aversion to openness was revealed by RHI to have been such a liability.Mrs Gray has a remarkable and atypical background. During the Troubles – in what The Sunday Times later described as “an unusual ‘career break’ in the s” – she came from London take over the Cove Bar on the Hilltown Road between Newry and Mayobridge, less than ten miles from the border, with her husband, Portaferry-born country and western singer Bill Conlon.If Mrs Gray did get the job, it would represent the shattering of another glass ceiling for women and would for the first time see a triumvirate of women in Stormont Castle’s most senior roles.However, all this speculation may be academic. Several years ago the rules on choosing the Head of the Civil Service were changed to give the First Minister and deputy First Minister full final say on who is appointed.Therefore, with this huge choice ultimately in the hands of Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill, they will get who they want – unless, as is not infrequent, they cannot agree.Read More Read MorePay hike as Executive makes last-minute search for top civil servantPowerful official working to end Stormont secrecy presided over suppressing materialConor Murphy’s top civil servant also answerable to Cabinet Office ministers________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

 years onMr Evans, of Cardigan in West Wales, but now living in Brecon, said: ldquoIrsquod taken a call back in  to check my availability for a small comedy for BBC Three and set in South Wales.ldquoI met up with Christine Gernonand Ruth Jonesat the Castell Mynach pub near Llantrisant one afternoon to discuss the script and the locations they wanted me to scout.ldquoAn hour or so after the meeting, I got the call from the production company Baby Cow offering me the job.ldquoMy first task was to sit with Dave Ferrisand discuss the vision for Gavin  Staceyrsquos backdrop and get a feel for the key locations.ldquoStaceyrsquos hometown was scripted as a South Wales coastal town, but I was given a free run on this so the hunt took me to Aberavon, Porthcawl, Tenby, Saundersfoot, and Weston-super-Mare - a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Peter Cardwell at Hillsborough Castle.“I hope the book is a fun, frank and honest account of what it’s like to work in Westminster.”It’s his first time as an author and already his book has set tongues wagging across social media.Special advisers are a part of the government, yet who they are and what they do is much misunderstood. Key advisers to Cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister since the s, their role is shrouded in mystery, despite acres of newsprint devoted to high-profile members of the cohort, such as Alastair Campbell and Dominic Cummings.Peter Cardwell’s book lts the lid on the people Piers Morgan called ‘these miserable little creatures’, revealing who spads are, how Cabinet ministers use and interact with them, how much influence they have and how they deal with the civil service. Featuring numerous anecdotes from dealing with counter-terror emergencies in COBRA to explaining what a dental dam is to the Justice Secretary, to having your inside leg measured in a Minister of the Crown’s office, this book has it all.BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said: “Peter allows you to peep behind the curtain of a much caricatured but little understood part of our political universe. With the structures of government in flux it’s a timely look at how some of the key relationships in Westminster work, and how they sometimes misfire.”Michael Crick, veteran political journalist and investigative authorsaid: “A book we have long needed.Peter Cardwell’s book fizzes with stories and humour from his experience as an adviser to four dferent ministers, and his years as a Westminster journalist with BBC Newsnight, ITV and Sky News.”https:www.portadowntimes news uk-news ni-man-peter-cardwell-loses-job-boris-johnson-reshuffle-A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbbdfedebcdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bedceacececaea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school.
