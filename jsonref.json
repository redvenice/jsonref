It has managed to combine the things that made it such an attractive sport in the past — the camaraderie and the spirit of sportsmanship — with the modern demand for professional sports to be gripping and entertaining.Nor has it yet become a money machine, either for players or for clubs. It has none of the horrible avarice of FIFA, football\u0027s world body — where the billions at stake over which country holds the World Cup have led to endless corruption scandals.True, rugby\u0027s top players are now mostly earning decent salaries, but nothing outrageous. Charles Piutau of Bristol is paid £1 million a season, but he is an exception.When I was in Bath for that match, I was outside Topshop when Taulupe Faletau, the injured Wales star, wandered by with his wife and child. He is one of the best players in the world, but lives the same life as the people who watch him.Rugby has avoided the grotesque money of football — the multi-millions that have turned footballers into princelings of excess with women, champagne and Bentleys on tap.         Taulupe Faletau is one of the best players in the world, but lives the same life as the people who watch himOne of the central differences between football and rugby is the way in which players react when the referee intervenes.In rugby, they run back the necessary ten metres to accept the penalty against them. Occasionally, the most pumped up member of the scrum might look with outrage towards the touchline. But that\u0027s it.In football? Well, we know don\u0027t we? The swearing at and pushing of referees is endemic to the game. And it becomes ingrained, too, in the minds of the younger fans.Similarly, look out on Saturday for the inevitable injuries. In rugby, people get hurt. But when they go down, again unlike football, you can be pretty sure they are suffering real pain. It is highly unusual for a player on a rugby field to pretend to be injured. More likely they play on with bits of them hanging off in the manner of Monty Python\u0027s Black Knight: \u0027Tis but a flesh wound . . . \u0027For children living in a world of fake victimhood, a world in which people have moved so far from the values of the stiff upper lip and the refusal to bow to adversity, rugby teaches that there is a better way.Of course, there are examples of rugby players and supporters behaving badly. But they are exceptions that prove a glorious rule: rugby in the professional era has stayed true to the Corinthian spirit of its amateur days.Many will say this is because it is a game played at expensive private schools, but not at your local state comprehensive.There is a certain truth to this. The England prop Kyle Sinckler was brought up by his single mum on a housing estate and went to Graveney School in South London.          England prop Kyle Sinckler was brought up by his single mum on a housing estate and went to Graveney School in South LondonIt had no rugby until a PE teacher saw Kyle\u0027s enthusiasm and helped him organise a team. Kyle says he told his classmates to just run forward and give the ball to him and he would score: an instruction as valid today as it was then.Other schools are less lucky. Let\u0027s hope England\u0027s success in Japan leads to more of them embracing the sport.Yet there\u0027s already a growing classlessness in the sport. The England wing Jack Nowell is a Cornish trawlerman\u0027s son. If you tell them in Wales it\u0027s just for posh people they will set you straight.Whatever your background, it\u0027s a thrilling game of bone-crushing brutality and the only sport we are good at in every corner of the UK. At its heart are values of decency and fair play rather than money and cheating, which is why it provides children with far better role models than football.In which case isn\u0027t there one simple course of action we should take once we\u0027ve won the World Cup tomorrow? Shouldn\u0027t we just make it our national sport?"},{"url":null,"title":"The huts sank Bismarck","story":"Share this article          At Abbots Cliff House in Capel le Ferne, Kent, 60 young German-speaking linguists were stationed from 1940 collecting messages from German forces.

But the verifying systems, which rely on both humans and automated systems, have not been perfect.In one case, Facebook mistakenly took down ads for Bush\u0027s baked beans because they contained the word \u0027Bush\u0027 and the food company was not registered with Facebook as a political advertiser. Media organizations have also seen their ads flagged for review when they promoted news stories about candidates or important issues.And then there\u0027s the question of what to do with inidual posts from politicians or other opinion makers, which can carry political messages and be shared widely even though they are not paid ads.Details about Twitter\u0027s new policy won\u0027t be released until Nov. 15, a week before it takes effect. But Twitter does call for removing not just campaign advertisements but also ads on issues of legislative importance. That could include such topics as climate change, gun control and immigration.EMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said Zuckerberg\u0027s stance probably isn\u0027t a financial decision, since political ads aren\u0027t big moneymakers.Facebook, which had 2018 revenue of $55.8 billion, said Wednesday that it expects ads from politicians to account for less than 0.5 percent of its revenue next year.       As for refusing to fact-check political ads, Facebook has said it wants to provide politicians with a \u0027level playing field\u0027 for communication and not intervene when they speak, regardless of what they\u0027re saying Twitter, which had revenue last year of about $3 billion, is thought to make even less from the ads it said it brought in only $3 million from political ads during the 2018 midterms.\u0027It is a really complicated decision,\u0027 Williamson said. \u0027I think that Mark Zuckerberg is truly struggling with figuring out what is the best thing to do for the company and Facebook users.\u0027Wedbush Securities managing director Michael Pachter likewise said the Facebook founder is trying to pull off a tricky balancing act.\u0027Zuckerberg is trying to satisfy investors by growing revenues and satisfy regulators and legislators by cracking down on false and misleading ads, while maintaining the virtuous stance of being a defender of free speech,\u0027 Pachter said.Daniel Kreiss, a journalism professor at the University of North Carolina, said that a middle ground for Twitter and Facebook might be to allow political ads but to prohibit targeting, or showing them only to specific groups of people.If campaigns aren\u0027t allowed to target, he said, messages will become broader and perhaps less misleading.Laura Packard, a partner at PowerThru, a digital consulting firm that works with left-of-center campaigns and advocacy groups, said Twitter\u0027s ban was the right decision for voters.\u0027This might make my work harder,\u0027 she said. \u0027But in general, I think that if any platform cannot police misinformation and lies, then they shouldn\u0027t offer paid advertising.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3844d87a9265ea8fbd2e4c1f178bf1d2f8c4fae0/429_1213_3312_1987/master/3312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63e647af3e0970e5131270facd018bdb","title":"nanna heitmann best photograph horse race siberia","story":"‘Two grandmothers told me: “It’s payday.

People come there to ask for healing.In Soviet times, Tuvan culture was suppressed. The shaman masks and  spirits – little puppets, sculptures, stuffed animals – were destroyed, and the people who continued to follow their ancient religions and traditions were persecuted. Now there’s this big revival, a newfound sense of pride.I grew up with Slavic fairytales about shamans and Baba Yaga. My mother is Russian and my grandfather was from Siberia. But I never really saw more of the country than Moscow, where I’d go to visit my grandmother in the summer. So last year I decided to go an exchange to Tomsk State University, in Siberia. I wanted to explore my roots.My plan was to travel the length of the Yenisei river. I couldn’t get to the actual source, which is further south in neighbouring Mongolia and only accessible by private helicopter. So I travelled to Tuva. You drive through what feels like endless Siberian woods and forested landscapes, you traverse one last mountain and suddenly you emerge on to the steppe. It feels like you’ve entered another world.People have gone there in search of freedom: adventurers, apostates, the Cossack riders pushing deeper and deeper into Siberia, criminals fleeing the Tsar. I met a man called Yuri who lived on a landfill. He told me if they chase him away, he’ll just find another landfill to live on. An ex-army officer I met, called Valentin, described himself as an anarchist ecologist. He sleeps outdoors, even when it’s -50C. This is one of the last remaining places where you can be removed from all western cultural influence, and live at one with nature.People in Tuva are tough. I’m attracted to people who are shaped by their environment, who choose to live or work in extreme situations. I think this kind of life fosters a certain kind of character. Not everyone chooses to live here, though. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tuva has become a place of great isolation, spiritual, physical and social.One day I went to a village where mostly Tuvan people live. Two grandmothers came outside. Perhaps because of the way I was dressed, they thought I was American. “What the hell are you doing here?” they said. “It’s Friday today. Everyone just got paid. Everyone is drunk, on their horses. Get out of here, it’s too dangerous.” And right then, two very drunk guys rode up to us. Nothing happened. But the horse came to symbolise for me this dualism – the quest for freedom and the pervasive isolation.• Nanna Heitmann is the winner of 2019’s Leica Oskar Barnack newcomer award for her series Hiding From Baba Yaga.Training: Photojournalism and documentary photography, University of Hanover.Influences: “The Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow with its old Russian masters, the Magnum archive, Joel Sternfeld, Tarkovsky.”High point: “Every time I go out to photograph, to e into other people’s worlds.

Concrete residential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments shot up across the country in a show of power from a state between two worlds, western democracy and the communist east. Photographs by Marko ĐuricaReuters. Written by Ivana Sekularac.Genex Tower is unmissable on the highway from Belgrade airport to the centre of the city. Its two soaring blocks, connected by an aerial bridge and topped with a long-closed rotating restaurant resembling a space capsule, are such an unusual sight, the 1977-build tower has become a magnet for tourists despite years of neglect. The tower is one of the most significant examples of brutalism – an architectural style popular in the 1950s and 1960s, based on crude, block-like forms cast from concrete.Brutalism was popular throughout the eastern bloc but the former Yugoslavia made it its own – seizing on it as a way to forge a visual identity poised between east and west. Interest in the style is soaring – particularly since a 2018 exhibition in New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) called Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948-1980.“We have dozens of people every week interested in taking our Yugo tour around city landmarks built from the 1950s to 1980s,” says Vojin Muncin, manager of the Yugotour sightseeing agency which guides tourists around the Serbian capital in Yugos, the former Yugoslavia’s once ubiquitous car. “Genex Tower is among the most interesting sight. People see it on their way from the airport and it immediately draws their attention.” Today one of the pillars is empty, while the other is residential. The rotating restaurant was last open in the 1990s.After the second world war, socialist Yugoslavia led by Josip Broz Tito set out to reconstruct a land destroyed by fighting. Initially allied to the Soviet Union, Tito broke with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1948. Residential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments all made of concrete shot up across the country. The architecture was supposed to show the power of a state between two worlds – western democracy and the communist east, looking to forge its own path and create a socialist utopia.But after Tito died in 1980, and economic crisis took hold, the new elites sought to distance themselves from the socialist regime, including its architecture. In 1991 the series of wars began that led to the collapse of Yugoslavia.“Now enough time has passed (since Yugoslavia fell apart) and people have begun to appreciate the architecture of Yugoslavia,” says Alan Braun, lecturer at Zagreb University’s architecture faculty. He explains that the style was unique because of its visible influence from the west, reflecting Yugoslavia’s unique position. Residential areas were planned to have enough parks, cinemas, swimming pools and even parking space.Keen to capitalise on the interest, Belgrade authorities are now considering opening parts of another masterpiece of Yugoslav brutalism – the Palata Srbija (Palace of Serbia) government building, which is currently only open once a year.The Palata Srbija building hosted former world leaders such as US presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and Russian leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. Each of the former Yugoslav republics had its own salon with a central room called the hall of Yugoslavia.Furniture and carpets were custom made and prominent artists produced paintings and mosaics. The outside of the building is concrete, but the inside is marble. Its centrepiece is a crystal chandelier beneath a 19-metre dome weighing more than nine tonnes. “It is a shame to keep such a master piece away from the eyes of the public,” said Sandra Vesic Tesla, curator of the building.Other examples of Yugoslav brutalism include the huge memorials commemorating the struggle against fascism by Tito’s partisans, often placed in dramatic rural settings. Many of those pieces of art remain in disrepair, such as the monument to the uprising against fascism in Petrova Gora in Croatia.However, the Tjentiste memorial, commemorating the killing of 7,000 people by the Nazis was renovated last year. Miodrag Zivkovic, the 91-year-old sculptor of the 19-metre-high concrete Tjentiste memorial, was among the first artists in the former Yugoslavia to use concrete.“It is stable material, resembling stone but it is easier to work with,” he said. “For every project back in those days there was a national contest, and artists from all over the country had the opportunity to apply, and that competition produced quality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25201440ca4c7b871a4426d48596920b71f8946c/83_70_5861_4654/master/5861.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ff81fe3e983de390907e8c777c53ad71 1400w","title":"how philip pullman lyra won the world","story":"As His Dark Materials comes to TV, the prize-winning children’s author Katherine Rundell looks at how a scrappy girl became one of literature’s best-loved charactersI first read Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy as a young teen it felt like a revelation. The books had a rough-textured animal-breath closeness that I had rarely encountered before, and at the heart of that was a small child, swift witted and loose handed with the truth, throwing mud at rival children, and her soul companion, her daemon Pantalaimon. I decided there and then, with all acknowledgements to the glory and joy of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, of Sophie in Diana Wynne Jones’s Howl’s Moving Castle, of Malorie Blackman’s Sephy Hadley in Noughts \u0026amp Crosses and of Roald Dahl’s Matilda, that the greatest heroine in British children’s books was Lyra.There is good evidence that many people of my generation felt the same. Pullman now shares with Shakespeare, Jonathan Swift and Philip Sidney the distinction of having invented a popular English-language name that has become so popular it’s now part of the lexicon. We owe the name Vanessa to Swift, who gave it as a piglatinish nickname to his lover Esther (Esse for short) Vanhomrigh, and Pamela (originally pronounced, originally, Pameela) to Sidney. Shakespeare has at least two the first sighting we have of Miranda (from mirandus, meaning wonderful) is The Tempest, and Jessica, probably in an Anglicisation of the Old Testament Hebrew name Iscah, first appears in English in The Merchant of Venice. And last year, 362 new Lyras were born.The name came, originally, from a misunderstanding. Pullman told the New Yorker: “There was a hymn I particularly liked called ‘Jesus Christ Is Risen Today, Alleluia’ … And under the number of the hymn, printed in small italics, was usually the name of the author. In this case, the name there was Lyra Davidica.” It was, he thought, a good name. “In fact, what Lyra Davidica means is the ‘harp of David’. ‘Lyra’ is a Greek word for a musical instrument like a harp.”Where did Lyra herself come from? She has, I think, DNA from many places: from the tricksters in old English ballads, from William Brown and his Outlaws, from the orphaned Cinderella (not the Disney one the versions from the 17th and 18th centuries, who had wit and guile and an edge of ruthlessness on their side. In Giambattista Basile’s La Gatta Cenerentola, Zezolla murders her stepmother by chopping off her head with the lid of a trunk.) Pullman told me: “Lyra just came to me as she was. I didn’t change a bit, or alter anything to her advantage. Having taught in middle schools for 12 years or so, I was well aware that there was a Lyra in every class. The point I always make, when asked about it, is that Lyra is not special. She’s ordinary, not to say common. But it’s the qualities she shares with so many real girls that help her when she finds herself in extraordinary circumstances.”So Lyra is in some ways utterly commonplace: solid legged, dirty nailed, a liar without much concern about the consequences of her lies. That ordinariness is what makes her so vivid despite the fact that the witches have a prophecy about her, she doesn’t have, unlike Harry Potter, any particular magic: she has nothing in her that makes her uniquely suited for her task ahead. She is made, not born, a hero. As Pullman says, “I’m an old-fashioned existentialist in some ways: existence precedes essence, and I’ll fight anyone who says different.” It takes work, the books tell us, to become a heroine: strenuous effort, constant attention to the world, a willingness to peel back the layers of your own heart.But of course she is also not ordinary, because she has in her possession a compass-like device that can tell the truth, one of the loveliest inventions of children’s fiction, alongside Tolkien’s ring and Rowling’s pensieve: an alethiometer (from the Greek aletheia, truth). Her ability to read it gives her, in the world of the book, an extraordinary authority that most children are denied. She is able to transcend that one factor of childhood that I found hardest to bear: the sense of disfranchisement from a world that extends so far beyond your understanding as to be painfully opaque. I read with a fierce hunger to see the world I hated, above everything, not understanding.I think a true hero or heroine needs to have both something we want or covet (for instance, a princedom in Denmark a fairy godmother) and something that we are (tormented by our own uncertainties transformable). Lyra has both in Pantalaimon. The daemons – animal manifestations of the human soul – are the reason the books pulse with life: they have, after all, twice the usual amount of life in them. I am often asked, by children I meet at school visits or book festivals, what would be my daemon? It became to a whole generation of readers a kind of taxonomy of self-definition (I think mine would be something that seeks to be up high: a squirrel, or a bird of the less glossy kind.)The thing I wanted most, though, changed over the course of the books. By The Amber Spyglass, the final book in the trilogy, what I wanted was not the alethiometer, nor even a daemon, but the love. Lyra falls in love with Will Parry, and finds herself stunned. Their love is physically felt: “I want to kiss you and lie down with you and wake up with you every day of my life till I die.” Sexuality, and the adult love that comes with it, is in Pullman’s world something to cherish: something, seen in its true light, more astonishing and surprising even than riding over snow on an armoured bear. Pullman said in an interview a few years ago that, if the book is a version of Paradise Lost, “what I wanted to do was represent the fall as entirely good. It is good for people to know things, to grow up, to become sexual beings.”And Lyra’s love allows her a different kind of seeing: it is the transformative vision of her love that allows her – without giving away the plot – to save Pullman’s world. That is, perhaps, the final reason Lyra has been so loved: she is in part Pullman’s longhand philosophical proof of an argument at the heart of all three books of the trilogy: notice. Lyra and Pan’s eyes are everywhere. She is curious above everything. It is the core demand of the books: pay loving attention to the world. We owe the world our ferocious attention, to fail at that would be the true fall.I’ve been writing children’s books for more than a decade now when I go to speak at schools, irrespective of country, the children’s questions are often the same. (“Where do you get your ideas from? Do you ever get stuck? How much money do you make? Do you write with a pen?” These all seem entirely fair questions to me, and in fact are what I long to ask other writers.) But recently at a festival in Italy, I met a more than usually philosophical group of 12 year olds. They asked: “What is the colour of happiness?” and “What one thing would you change about your life?” – like being interviewed by a gang of small, glitterpen wielding Kierkegaards. The last question was, “What is it you are trying to do when you write?” and I thought of His Dark Materials. As a child those books felt to me like food. So what I am trying to do is informed profoundly by that: I want to build stories that feel like nourishment. His Dark Materials stands as a testament to what children’s books can be: three books that add up to a feast.• His Dark Materials begins on BBC1 at 8pm on 3 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e2c666cc5fa4a02f7e0758552ed809e09aa789f/0_283_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aed2b3e5dca00e442507239369f3af4e","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, an admirable post from steevieb, who has had a change of heart about Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge:Some time ago (years) I began reading Olive Kitteridge. Just couldn’t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit. Last week I decided to give it another go, I am so glad I did, totally blew me away, beautifully written, I loved every page so much that I immediately bought Amy and Isabelle, which to me was even better. How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle. Moods, I guess.Tom Mooney has also been rereading some classics:Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, not for the first time. It is wonderful, perfect even. I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading.I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever’s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It’s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was.Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2:Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby’s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion.fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson:What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts.What I particularly like about Bryson’s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader.ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan:The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller’s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful.BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer “which I enjoyed a lot”:I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it’s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don’t.Now this is a funny and wise book. The quips and cultural insights are ridiculously true. Especially about the X and Y generations. Professor Chandra himself is a true delight … I found myself asking, “So who IS this smart guy who wrote this fine book?” That’s when you know it’s a good’un. This book is smart, hilarious, and best of all ... kindhearted. Yes, filled with an open hearted way of looking at the people we love and our struggles as well as struggles of our world and culture today.Finally, MarGar65 has just finished Penelope Fitzgerald’s Innocence:I loved it. I am so glad her books have come into my life! What an observant author ... What trust she places in us as she unfolds her stories. She refuses to bend to the expectation of a happy ending. I fear I am running out of To-Be-Read Fitzgeralds ... This is most alarming in a sense because I will run out of new Fitzgeralds, but I am relieved when I think that I can go always go back and reread them all.Going back to reread Fitzgerald sounds like an admirable idea. Just the kind of thing that should get us through winter…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Hope school was OK. Are you buying that? Hope you have a lovely dinner.’ That can be an encouragement – the world is a safer place than they think. And actually that transmission of kindness shows maybe there is a possibility of communication, particularly for those who are shy or withdrawn. It’s really important that they expand their experiences to learn that while they might have had really difficult experiences, there could be other people who actually can be protective and supportive.”Talking to younger childrenGetting people, especially children, to open up, and share their feelings and thoughts can be trickier than we sometimes think. But Bush suggests that the best reason to reach children is to remember that they are people, albeit a little younger than us.“Remember, children and young people are people. The reason I say that is, we like to be spoken to in an empathetic and understanding way. Most of us prefer someone to talk to us at our own eye height.“Let’s say a six-year-old child is banging two toys together. Instead of jumping to a conclusion, try: ‘Oh, I see Superman really wants to hit Batman today, what are they fighting about?’ You never know where those kinds of questions – which start with the experience of the young person, in their world, using their metaphors – can lead to. The way into it is just by allowing the person to talk in the way they want to talk.”Listen, understand, empathiseMaking sure we’re really listening, and understanding what a person is saying to us, might sound simple, but it’s all too easy to trivialise without even realising it. “The other really important thing is not to be overly reassuring, and not to dismiss things,” says Bush.“For instance, a 21-year-old comes home and says: ‘I’m having a horrific time at work. I feel bullied, I’m failing, I feel I need to just walk away, I’m really stressed.’ Someone might reply: ‘Yeah, we all feel like that’. This kind of response is so demeaning, so dismissive. It doesn’t recognise their pain and distress.“Listen, acknowledge and be understanding. The sheer amount of people who just wanted to hear ‘Wow, that sounds really difficult. I can’t believe you’re been going through that’ as a first response … They didn’t need platitudes or complexity. They just wanted to be understood.”Connections mean resilience“There’s a lot of evidence that shows that social connectedness, a feeling of belonging – particularly connecting with people who have had similar or shared life interests or experiences – is actually very protective,” says Bush. “So young people who feel like they belong, who feel they have a sense of community, and feel able to talk to others in some way, are more resilient in the face of adversity, difficulty or mental health problems.”Britain Get TalkingTo find out more about ITV’s Britain Get Talking campaign, run in collaboration with mental health charities Mind, YoungMinds and SAMH, visit itvbritaingettalking or stv.tvbritaingettalking"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7916084d58e06078131293a0a0c5615bfb396a2/0_89_4434_2660/master/4434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df299faf90e6460d706d63074bde87bb","title":"boeing 737 cracks how common are they and should you be worried","story":"Qantas has grounded three of its 737s due to cracks in the planes’ ‘pickle fork’, but at least one expert sees little cause for concernAustralia’s national airline, Qantas, this week grounded three of its Boeing 737s after cracks were found in a part of the plane known as the “pickle fork”.The plane – the 737-NG to be precise – is one of the most commonly used models in the world, with over 7,000 in service globally.So far, 50 aircraft around the world have been found with cracks, including nine in South Korea and three belonging to Southwest Airlines in the US. The Australian aircraft engineers union has called on Qantas to ground all of its 737s.But Qantas and other affected airlines say that they have completed the relevant checks, and are proceeding with an abundance of caution.Dr Garth Pearce, a senior lecturer in aerospace engineering at the University of New South Wales, says this should be enough to ensure the safety of all passengers.The pickle fork lies between the wing and the fuselage. It strengthens the connection between the wing and the body of the plane.But, as this article from the ABC points out, the pickle fork is not the only thing that holds the wing in place.The issue is related to the number of flight cycles a plane has gone through.A cycle is one take-off and landing – with most commercial planes going through roughly 1,700 cycles a year.Last month, a global aviation regulation was issued requiring all Boeing 737s with more than 30,000 lifetime cycles to be urgently checked – within seven days.737s with between 22,600 and 30,000 also need to be checked, but within seven months. Planes below 22,600 do not need to be checked until they reach that milestone.This week, Qantas discovered that three of its planes that were below the 30,000 mark had cracks (at 27,000 cycles).The airline then urgently checked all 737s between 22,600 and 30,000 cycles, completing this within seven days rather than the seven months required. The airline does not have any planes above 30,000.This may vary from airline to airline, but we can use Qantas as an example.Out of a total 75 Boeing 737s, Qantas has none above 30,000. There are 33 above 22,600 and 42 are below 22,600.Qantas has said it will not check any of the planes below 22,600.Ryanair has more than 400 737s in service, but has not disclosed whether it has discovered any issues so far. Virgin Australia has inspected all 19 of its 737s over 22,600 cycles, without findings cracks. American Airlines and United Airlines said they are inspecting their entire fleets but have not found any cracks so far.The Australian aircraft engineers union has called on Qantas to ground all of its 737s. But the airline has said it is confident that, after checking all those above 22,600, it does not need to take further action.UNSW’s Pearce told  Australia this was sufficient. He said that a small percentage of planes would be affected, and that the risk of cracks in those with fewer cycles would significantly drop.“This whole process shows that regulation really does work in the aerospace industry. A crack was found on one aircraft and all of a sudden all the airlines around the world are notified, and are searching and are rectifying it.Pearce said he did not think airlines needed to follow Qantas’s lead in accelerating the check of the 22,600 to 30,000 cycle planes from seven months to one week.“Qantas has done the right thing from a public relations perspective and gone and done it on an accelerated timeframe. But I don’t think that’s a pure safety decision. It is showing that they are being proactive, and showing the public that they really do care.“They are going over and above. I wouldn’t recommend that airlines do anything other than what the regulator asked them.”Boeing has also said that the checks have “mainly been focused on the oldest aircraft, so the percentage of aircraft with cracks found should reduce as newer aircraft are inspected”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b9ffb0c7a55645d1e61f64d9a65ebcfaf9f8b77/0_100_6821_4094/master/6821.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b2370d692f373ac5818d9ef964f6702","title":"asian markets rise on china manufacturing bounce uk factories us non farm payrolls business live","story":"News flash: the UK manufacturing PMI from CIPSMarkit rose to 49.6 in October from 48.3 in September.

Our economics team reports:With only days to go until parliament is dissolved, the chancellor Sajid Javid has abandoned plans to announce his choice for Threadneedle Street’s top job during the autumn.The chancellor is believed to have made the decision to delay because he felt that making a choice at a politically sensitive time might damage the independence of the Bank.The BBC’s business editor Simon Jack reported last night that he’s been told that Dame Minouche Shafik is the top pick for the next Bank of England governor.She would be the central bank’s first female governor in its 325-year history. The Egyptian-born British-American economist has already worked at the Bank, as deputy governor, and is currently director of the London School of Economics.Even though Brexit has been postponed for a second time, carmakers are going ahead with costly production shutdowns designed to avoid Brexit disruption. The latest extension, to 31 January, came too late for carmakers who had already agreed closures with staff and suppliers.More than half of the UK’s car manufacturing capacity had some form of shutdown planned to coincide with the 31 October deadline in case of disruption to the supply of parts, a repeat of similar production pauses in April after the original 31 March Brexit date.Jaguar Land Rover will stop making cars and engines at Halewood, Castle Bromwich, Wolverhampton and Solihull from Monday to Friday, with employees instead assigned to maintenance and training.BMW’s plant in Oxford is busy ramping up production of its new electric Mini, which the company hopes will be a mass-market battery-powered vehicle. However, workers did not come in for the Thursday night shift and the plant will remain shut from Friday until Monday.Toyota’s plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire, remained closed on Friday, with a return planned on Monday.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says:The biggest risk now would appear to be the risk of a Labour government, however given current polling that doesn’t look likely right now. Of course that could change, given what happened in 2017, but for now there appear to be a lot of sterling short positions being pared back, as optimism grows that the worst for the pound may well be behind it. The pound is trading slightly higher against the dollar and the euro. It has benefited from dollar weakness following the US Federal Reserve’s rate cut on Wednesday. Despite Boris Johnson’s pledge that Britain would leave the EU on 31 October “do or die,” the deadline has passed. He secured agreement for a general election on 12 December after the EU granted a further Brexit extension to 31 January.European stock markets have also opened higher.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.A surprise bounce in Chinese manufacturing has boosted shares in Asia to three-month highs, and stock markets in Europe are expected to follow their lead.However, the latest CaixinMarkit monthly survey showed China’s factories ramped up activity at the fastest pace in more than two years in October as export orders rose. Its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 51.7 from 51.4 in September, marking the third month of expansion. Economists had expected a reading of 51.0.Sentiment was dampened by a Bloomberg report citing unnamed Chinese officials expressing doubts over whether China and the US can reach a comprehensive long-term trade deal, as the two sides inch closer to signing a “phase one” agreement in an effort to end the 16-month trade war.Markets are now waiting for a key UK manufacturing survey out later this morning and US non-farm payrolls jobs data for October, released at lunchtime.David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says on the UK manufacturing PMI:The consensus estimate is 48.1, which would be a decline from the 48.3 in the previous update. The past five report have shown the sector is in contraction territory as Brexit anxiety has taken its toll on the industry.On US non-farm payrolls, he says:Broadly speaking, the number of jobs being created has been growing at a slower pace in the past six months. It could be a sign the US economy is cooling, or else it might be because the labour market is close to topping out. The average earnings component will be in focus too as workers who earn more tend to spend more, also a move higher could be sign the jobs market is tightening.Today is Christine Lagarde’s first day as president of the European Central Bank following Mario Draghi’s departure, and Alison Rose starts her new role as chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, one of the UK’s biggest banks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a7100613ee132932ba9cfff24776c9b789e5a1/0_223_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f27db8fb814383c3b82ea22905cc44","title":"10 timeless fashion trends that never date","story":"Iconic staples rule the catwalk this season.

Like the crowd of BBC colleagues walking with her to her equal pay hearing, there was something cheering about the gesture of solidarity, but something heartbreaking, too, about its necessity. What makes equal pay cases so hard is that they’re not just about the money, but often about something far more excruciating to discuss in public: the unspoken assumptions about who is cherished and who isn’t who gets to be feted as the office rising star and who is treated like part of the furniture.Officially the case revolves around whether the £440 Ahmed gets per episode to present Newswatch – a BBC News Channel show analysing audience reactions to its programmes – is fair given Jeremy Vine got £3,000 to present Points of View, which involves roughly the same thing except on BBC One. But the broader public row it has ignited is nowhere near that simple. The BBC has fought its corner not just by arguing that one show is more “niche” than the other – although Ahmed’s actually gets more viewers – but that the two presenters fill different roles. Her show needs a trained journalist, but Vine was paid the really big bucks to be “the audience’s friend”. Translation: she’s doing a skilled job, but he is radiating a far more mysterious and likable quality that makes viewers feel at home with him, and just happens to be strangely unquantifiable on paper.Likability is such a slippery concept for women, perhaps especially for women of colour, because it’s so often the shelter beneath which all sorts of kneejerk prejudices lurk. For years, Hollywood justified its glaring pay gap by claiming that there weren’t enough female or black actors capable of packing them in at the box office. Nothing personal, obviously, but female leads couldn’t expect the really big sums commanded by their male counterparts, because audiences just didn’t seem to enjoy watching them quite so much. That argument began to crumble only when women climbed high enough up the ladder both to risk casting other women, and to start demanding more concrete proof of men’s supposedly irresistible appeal.As the actor Reese Witherspoon, who set up her own production company in exasperation with the output of mainstream studios, put it recently: “Streaming services using data to discover what people want to watch has changed my entire career, and allowed women to be valued in a way we never have before.” It turns out audiences are only too happy to sit through a show that doesn’t revolve around a man, so long as it’s the right show, which raises awkward questions about why a male-dominated industry ever thought differently.And it doesn’t just happen in showbusiness. Hillary Clinton was dogged throughout the 2016 presidential election campaign by arguments that she wasn’t “likable” enough to win, yet few voters could explain exactly what made her so much more hateful than Donald Trump, an egomaniac dogged by accusations of sexual assault. A man can be endorsed by Ku Klux Klan chiefs and still win, but woe betide a woman who doesn’t smile enough. What’s likable in a man, meanwhile, is often deemed rather less so in a woman everyone loves Ken Clarke’s refusal to take himself too seriously, but a female chancellor who confessed as cheerfully as he did to not having read the Maastricht treaty would surely have been eaten alive.And after decades of writing about politics, I still find the process by which rising stars are identified surprisingly hard to describe and sometimes to justify. A consensus about who has charisma and who doesn’t, who chimes with voters and who leaves them cold, emerges by a kind of osmosis: journalists pounce on the names they hear from MPs, pollsters test the leadership contenders who keep cropping up in the papers, bookies adjust their odds depending on what everyone else is saying and everyone then tries to second-guess what a public riddled with its own prejudices wants to see standing on the steps of Downing Street. It would be a miracle if that process of names bubbling up from the Westminster gloop wasn’t coloured by all our unconscious assumptions, and it might be hard to explain on a witness stand.But it’s arguably just an exaggerated version of what goes on in all walks of life, whenever decisions are being made within a company about who to watch for reasons that are at best hazy and at worst downright prejudiced. Sam Smethers, chief executive of equality charity the Fawcett Society, compares the assumptions so often made about the value of women’s work to a raggedy jumper: pull on the right thread, and it’s surprising how fast the whole thing unravels.And that’s exactly what equal pay legislation exists to do. The magic of a tribunal is that it puts the onus not on mortified women to prove they’re worth it, but on employers to provide objective reasons for the salary decisions they make – and if they can’t, to make good the damage. Whatever becomes of Ahmed’s case, or the dozens like it that are said to be waiting in the wings against the BBC, she has done us all a service by triggering what should be a much wider conversation about who is valued and why. For once you start looking, there are threads dangling everywhere, just asking to be pulled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d75a7abb02243be432d99ee7e24604b344cb0d3/0_0_1108_665/master/1108.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=8f26cc681f2af839499f84620295798f","title":"polls election brexit inequality","story":"A hard Brexit and entrenched inequality – or a nation where we can feed our kids and save the planet? It’s up to usElection night, 2017, at Harrow leisure centre was a tense affair. I had been in the borough for more than a month covering the battle for Harrow West – a Labour-held marginal that was 19th on the Tories’ target list. Labour won it in 1997 with a slim majority and had clung on to it ever since.The tension however, related to next-door Harrow East, a Tory constituency. It went to recounts, sending the Tory candidate pacing nervously in every direction. He had considered his seat safe the Labour MP for Harrow West believed his was at risk. Yet Labour won Harrow West by 13,314 votes, increasing its majority fivefold, while in Harrow East the Tory majority was reduced to just 1,757. I had been in the area to write about a seat that Labour might lose. It hadn’t occurred to me they might gain one.I wasn’t alone in this error. Labour had ploughed nearly all its resources into Harrow West. Its activists from both constituencies were grateful for the new votes but had no idea where they had come from.Today, Harrow East is the 36th target seat for Labour (Jeremy Corbyn was there earlier this week) Harrow West is 149th for the Tories, effectively off the radar but not necessarily out of the danger zone completely. After all, they are the same places they were two and a half years ago: the provenance of many of those votes remains a mystery and they could yet switch again. And much, politically, has happened since 2017 that could make them change their minds.We don’t know what the story of this forthcoming election will be. We may not know until it is over. The campaigns have only just started. People haven’t voted yet. Electability is, ultimately, decided not by opinion-forming elites but by the voters.Elections are not political thrillers. They are, or should be, about something real. Their significance should go beyond who wins, to what might change. Those two things are connected, of course, but not inextricably so. One of the reasons poor people are among the least likely to vote is because they often end up remaining poor, regardless of who wins. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter who wins – they could always get poorer. But nobody ever put that on a bumper sticker.Far more significant is what will change. There is more to politics than elections. The electoral conversation draws its energy from polls, gaffes, ads and swings. But none of that is particularly relevant unless it impacts people’s livelihoods, potential, challenges and life chances.It is easy to get stuck in the electoral. This particular moment is finely balanced. The situation is incredibly volatile the context unprecedented. Those who claim to know how things will turn out are simply revealing how little they actually know. Because the outcomes of elections are always of national significance, we tend to always treat them as national events – when sometimes they more closely resemble a range of electoral microclimates, each with its own ecosystem. This feels like one of those times.The truth is we don’t know who is going to win. But we do have a clear idea of why it matters. This election is about something: indeed in a sense it’s about everything. It offers as stark a choice in terms of the direction of the country, both at home and abroad, as most can remember.Unfortunately, on the issue that brought us to this point, Brexit, there may not be any clear resolution. The country has narrowly voted to do something it does not want to pay the price for doing, and which its polity has been unable to bring itself to do. The best many of us can hope for is to put whatever deal is done to a referendum and vote again. But whatever the result, that won’t resolve it. The country is horribly ided. We have voted ourselves into a mess and we’ll have to vote ourselves out of it.Pretty much every party in England and Wales has policies to deal with these issues that I can live with apart from one – the Conservatives. It’s not hard to see why they want to make this election about Brexit: they have nothing else. Their message is clear if nonsensical. “Get Brexit done” is no more a policy than “Brexit means Brexit” was a strategy. But beyond that, the best they can offer is to soften some of the worst of austerity while doubling down on the worst of everything else – from stop and search to shredding regulations.One scenario, among many, this time around is that the Conservatives lose votes, win a majority and get to pursue their agenda anyhow. That could be the story of the election: that a country with a majority opposed to the politics of poverty, greed, deregulation and austerity, a hard Brexit and entrenched inequality could not or would not unite, strategically, to prevent them. Fortunately there are a myriad of other possible stories, where we help feed our children and save the planet. We still have time to write them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/537360dd67c892ac6e341c5118478511fa26951b/0_314_2259_1355/master/2259.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3766352307f64ddadeb4e89ed23d79e","title":"smartphones children technology mobile phones","story":"When you raise the question of not giving kids phones at all, parents balk. ‘How can we do that?’ they ask. But what alternative is there?I’ve traveled the country over the last few years talking to parents and teachers about kids and social media. I’ve heard stories about everything from non-consensually shared nudes in their schools to smartphone addiction – kids can’t seem to put their phones down, which teachers say is disrupting class time and causing innumerable fights and misunderstandings. Everybody wants to know: “What do we do?” They’re all for limiting screen time – though it’s hard, they say their kids act like addicts when you try to take away their drugs – but when you raise the question of not giving kids phones at all, they balk. “How can we do that?” parents ask. “Our kids will have no social life. They won’t be able to function in the modern world.”Leaving this received wisdom aside for the moment, let’s look at all the other things kids won’t be able to do if they don’t have a phone. They won’t be able to be part of a group chat, the site of hours of distracting discussions which arguably would be better had in person, where face-to-face interaction would elevate the quality of the conversation and deepen social bonds. They won’t be able to send or receive nudes, which has increasingly become their first introduction to the world of sex. The exchange of nudes at a young age (I’ve reported it happening as young as the sixth grade) is thankfully no longer being normalized as just a “new kind of flirting” any more, now that it has become clear that it often takes place in an atmosphere of pressure or coercion – not to mention the real danger of nudes turning into revenge porn, the source of ruined lives.Explicit content doesn’t have to be porn. It’s readily available on YouTube and across all social media platforms. A kid with a phone will inevitably see something his or her parents would be appalled to know he or she has seen. “Consumer groups caution that despite promises to police inappropriate content, YouTube continues to show violent imagery, drug references, racist language and sexually suggestive content that reaches children,” reported the Washington Post. The Common Sense Media survey reported that twice as many kids are watching mostly YouTube videos every day as they did four years ago, and the average time spent watching videos has about doubled, to an hour each day. And yes, often these are just videos of their favorite pop stars or clips from their favorite TV shows but sometimes they are videos of the most horrible things imaginable.This type of exposure is not without its emotional effects nor is the constant pressure that comes with a phone to broadcast one’s life – one’s inauthentically perfect, happy, glorious life. This pressure is particularly toxic for girls, who in study after study in recent years are seen to be struggling with rising rates of anxiety and depression and even suicide connected to the use of phones and social media.But sure, go ahead and buy your 11-year-old a phone.What could possibly go wrong?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00b84ec47e131a0a0024ad917ae8fed2001c94de/0_8_5238_3143/master/5238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5538ccd8c75d083890cb291cb1656558","title":"mark zuckerberg facebook regulate","story":"Let us be grateful for small mercies. Thank you Twitter for banning political advertising. Given that such advertising is by its nature biased, tendentious and hard to check, Twitter is behaving as a good publisher should. Politicians may make full use of its outlet. That is democracy. But as the organisation’s chief, Jack Dorsey, points out, with social media awash in “micro-targeting, deepfakes, manipulated videos and misinformation”, those who control it should keep it as clean as possible. Money may not buy truth, but it should not drown fairness.Facebook disagrees. Its boss, Mark Zuckerberg, declares it “not right for private companies to censor politicians or the news”. He subscribes to the romantic view of social media as the yellow brick road of digital’s global village. The road should not dictate who travels along it, it should just collect the tolls. That includes advertisers, the sustenance of Zuckerberg’s $500bn empire. This argument reruns the celebrated – or notorious – US supreme court ruling on Citizens United in 2010, which overturned restrictions on campaign finance as being an offence against free speech. From then on, lobbyists, corporations, tycoons, anyone with money, could spend what they liked during an election. It declared open season for fake news, targeted ads and dark money “Super Pacs”. That season gave us Donald Trump, and has yet to close.There was some argument for the 2010 decision, as there is in Zuckerberg’s opposition to curbs on advertising. If an ad is mendacious, let the reader judge it as such. Don’t censor the web. If you suppress one form of debate, you shift power to another – in this case editors of the “elitist media”. The democracy of the web should be free to air, come poor and rich. This might have cut ice in digital’s golden age, the nineties and noughties. If you let everything hang out, was the line, global peace would emerge as if from a celestial algorithm. It has not turned out that way. Not a day passes without some new evil being laid at social media’s door, from Instagram’s part in the death of British teenager Molly Russell to the persecution of Britain’s female MPs.We can all see benefits in the digital revolution. We can also see bad driving out good. As catalogued in Shoshana Zuboff’s tome of our times, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, we get intrusion, bullying, obscenity and extremism in a thousand devious guises.Zuckerberg’s oft-repeated claim that he is not a “publisher” is self-serving rubbish. His platforms are devices to project information and opinion into the public realm for profit – as precise a definition of publication as I know. To allow users to do this anonymously and without liability is a licence to mendacity and slander. It pollutes debate and corrupts democracy.Free markets are a blessing to human society, but since Adam Smith they have tended towards monopoly and self-interest. Social media are no different. Zuckerberg makes the same claim as America’s gun lobby: Facebook does not kill people, people do. As the Edward Snowden revelations showed, the boundary between social media and mass surveillance, whether by capitalism or the state, is now hopelessly permeable. Like any market, this one must be regulated. It is a poor comment on western democracy that it still is not.Anyone delving into this realm is easily lost in technology and jargon, but we must try. Wiser heads – including at times Zuckerberg himself – have recognised that things are getting out of hand. Facebook, Google and Twitter this year lobbied the British government to introduce a mechanism for combating “online harm”. They remain reluctant to take that responsibility themselves.I believe this presents a regulatory challenge on a scale not seen since the early debates over nuclear weapons. We must somehow disentangle the public from the private digital sphere. There must be control over those who trade the identities and behaviour of inidual citizens. We must define the concept of causing online harm, as distinct from causing offence. We must place obligation and liability on digital “publishers” for the accuracy and legality of third-party content – as we do on conventional publishers.As in any public forum, anonymity must end for those expecting the privilege of access to public debate. Facebook and others accept de facto moral liability, by filtering and censoring “unsuitable” content. They accept, at last, that showing teenagers how to take their own lives is not free speech but public menace.Now they must accept that regulators should dictate the rules of democracy, or it will degenerate into an online Game of Thrones. Publishers have an obligation not to disseminate lies. One reason for the ongoing popularity of the mainstream media, such as the BBC, the New York Times and this newspaper, is that their information is trusted. Some editor is subjecting their output to some ideal of balance, fairness and accuracy. Material is not spewed out at random, or targeted so as to confirm inidual bias. Editors are not, as early web enthusiasts predicted, out of date. They are necessary.The British press has fought against state regulation, other than over monopoly and laws of libel. I think that is right, not out of principle but because statutory regulation is not justified by press misbehaviour or imbalance – or not yet. Self-regulation sort of works. At present it is not the mainstream media driving decent people out of politics. It is what Zuboff calls the “psychic numbing of strip-search technology”. We have not begun to grasp its potency or its aura of invincibility. Today’s robber barons steal from us not our money but something more important, our privacy and integrity as iniduals. They cannot remain unregulated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69cceeee94512c5094fb5beff7e3462b68622bbd/0_185_3190_1913/master/3190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=368a9e3b09df08d7ffd25025d4006236","title":"the guardian view on election 2019 its about brexit above all","story":"The retirement of so many centrist Tories is a reminder that theirs has now become the Brexit party in all but nameIf the leavers, the Conservative reactionaries, the neoliberals and the ranks of Britain’s rightwing press – to say nothing of their friends Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin – had had their way, Friday would have been Britain’s first day outside the European Union since 31 December 1972. But the Halloween deadline has come and gone. Instead, largely as a result of the ruthless parliamentary exposure of Boris Johnson’s shabby political quackery, Britain remains part of Europe. Friday is therefore a day for relief and a modest celebration, not for defeat or dejection. A place in Europe, for which so many have fought so hard over the last three and a half years, remains ours. But its future now rests on the result of the general election in six weeks’ time.Mr Johnson captured the prime ministership in July on a shamelessly false prospectus. He promised he could get Britain out by 31 October, “whatever happens”. He told his party conference that it would happen “come what may”. He said he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than ask for another extension. Enough Tory members – 90,000 mainly white, elderly men living in southern England (fewer people than the population of Tunbridge Wells) – were taken in by this for him to oust Theresa May. But, as with most of Mr Johnson’s promises, these were merely cheap words. Like Mrs May, he ran into the stubborn reality that a majority of MPs want to stop any precipitate departure from the EU. Rather than compromise, as he should have done, Mr Johnson has now bounced the Commons into a premature election.He may have been its leader for only a little over three months, but Mr Johnson has had a major impact on his party. He has triggered and presided over a tranformation of the Tories into a rightwing nationalist party. What was once a broadly based movement of the centre-right is now a political sect, defined by a single issue, Brexit, which increasingly places the party on the wrong side of history.The exodus this week of centrist Conservative MPs who have had enough is eloquent testimony to that. The list of the expelled and the withdrawing, who include Ken Clarke, David Gauke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond, Jo Johnson, Oliver Letwin, David Lidington, Nicky Morgan, Amber Rudd and Rory Stewart, adds up to both a lost generation and a lost Tory tradition. Mims Davies, the employment minister, said this week that she is quitting, and asked whether female Tory MPs are going because of “the horrid state of the discourse, the threats, the hours, the lack of time with friends and family or never being able to switch off”. The upshot, as Iain Duncan Smith boasted this week, is stark. The Tories, he said, “are the Brexit party now”.As many have pointed out, a general election is an election about everything. Jeremy Corbyn, launching Labour’s campaign on Thursday, will fight it on austerity. The SNP will fight it on Scottish independence. In Northern Ireland, the election will, as ever, be about the union. None of these is a secondary issue. Yet Mr Duncan Smith’s words cut through the jungle of other issues to identify what this election is most irrevocably about. It is about whether the UK will leave the EU and end its commitment to Europe, or whether it will not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/706308b50e04fe4f08ae1541faae51b085889c21/0_0_941_576/master/941.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bb91a9bc46fea0cf8c3b004c89c24953 1880w","title":"are you a teacher who has left the uk to work abroad","story":"If you’re a primary or secondary school teacher who has left a school in England to teach in another country, we would like to hear from you Schools in England are struggling to recruit and retain sufficient teachers.

In France, it made her a sex-symbol to rival Bardot, and her stunning beauty and style achieve something almost extraterrestrial here. She plays Barbarella, an intrepid space adventurer who is entrusted with a vital intergalactic mission by the president of Earth, which involves nursing a blind angel on a distant planet by having sex with him. Fonda carries it off with dedication and style.This satire is, in some ways, a companion piece to her 1967 comedy Barefoot in the Park. It’s a critique of the American dream, which mockingly distorts the picture-book perfection of family life portrayed in the well-known Dick and Jane children’s books, which taught generations of Americans how to read while also perhaps schooling them in conformist attitudes. Dick and Jane are played by George Segal and Fonda, a well-off couple in a lovely home who turn to crime when he becomes unemployed. The film manages to be a spin on Bonnie and Clyde while also playing on Fonda’s own radical image. She has a bizarre broad-comedy scene in which she falls over while doing some amateur fashion modelling in a hotel dining room, causing mayhem.This extraordinary cameo, hardly more than a few minutes of screen time, is destined to become one of Fonda’s most cult performances. She plays Brenda Morel, a renowned, difficult, ageing movie actor. (There’s a PhD to be written on how older female stars only get his kind of self-parodic role in films.) She furiously berates a director (Harvey Keitel) who is trying to cast her in his new film, and, in an extraordinary scene on an aeroplane, we see her succumb to a full-scale temper tantrum that involves her screaming: “You fucking bitches!” and hitting a flight attendant before having a catastrophic hairpiece malfunction.Neil Simon adapted his Broadway hit for this movie, which was a key moment in Fonda’s early success during the run of frothy metropolitan comedies that made her name. It’s easy to forget how excellent she was – and is – playing comedy, with a droll lilt to her line readings she puts the free-spirited zing into this movie, which was clearly conscious of being a bit squaresville for its day. She is Corie, a newlywed (that very dated notion) married to super-handsome but conventional Paul (played by Robert Redford, one of the few Hollywood men who could match Fonda for beauty) and yearning for him to loosen up and go frolicking in the park barefoot (a signifier for further bareness?).Fonda became a star to take seriously in this shocking movie about the Great Depression directed by Sydney Pollack. It’s a grim metaphor for the exploitation and suffering of working people, and can be seen as a forerunner of our obsession with reality TV and social-media cruelty. The setting is a dance marathon in the 1930s, in which poverty-stricken people pair up to dance for days on end – stumbling around like miserable zombies in front of a jaded and sadistic audience – hoping to be the last couple standing for a big cash prize. Fonda plays Gloria, apparently the most cynical and ruthless contestant in the running, but dealing with an inner hurt.Neil Simon gave Fonda another great comic role in this bittersweet portmanteau movie, in which she plays a tough New York professional who flies into Los Angeles on a mission to confront her screenwriter ex-husband (Alan Alda) because their teenage daughter wants to live with him, not her. She has a great confrontation scene with Alda, simmering with contempt, hauteur and a strange unresolved attraction for her ex. The film is often noted for the fact that Fonda looks sensational in a bikini – this was the seed for her bestselling workout videos. She also looks great in glasses.This 50-minute film essay about a famous news photo of Fonda meeting Vietnamese communists in Hanoi in 1972 is directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. It was originally intended as an archly ironic postscript to Godard’s film Tout Va Bien, which also came out that year (and in which Fonda acted, but fell out with the director). Letter to Jane is simply a deconstructionist essayharangue, narrated by Godard and Gorin, critiquing the photo of Fonda, and also US leftism and Hollywood stardom.Fonda had that rare thing, a female co-star billing in this smart feminist workplace comedy, in which she plays Judy, who has to get a job in a huge corporate office after her husband runs off with another woman. Like her co-workers Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton, she is oppressed, harassed and exploited by her unspeakable male boss. This is an interesting role for Fonda, who is not cast as the overtly funny character nor the explicitly sexy one. Rather, she personifies a kind of benchmark normality. Yet there is something notably powerful and real in an opening scene in which she is yelled at because she doesn’t know how to work a particular piece of equipment a moment that crystallises her rage.This is one of Fonda’s most courageous and heartfelt performances, which won her a second Oscar. It is also tied up with her activities as anti-Vietnam war campaigner. She plays the wife of a US Marine Corps officer (Bruce Dern) who leaves for service in Vietnam. Left behind, she finds volunteer work in a veterans’ hospital and befriends a wheelchair user played by Jon Voight. They begin a relationship that culminates in a sex scene – notably forthright in its day – in which Fonda’s character experiences the first orgasm of her life. It’s a movie that was overshadowed by the more macho take offered by The Deer Hunter – but it’s a fine performance from Fonda.Here is the quintessential Fonda performance, in Alan J Pakula’s psychological thriller: she is smart, beautiful, tough and haunted – in a film that, like Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation, embodies a proto-Watergate fear of being spied upon. And Fonda provides a new spin on the classic “shady lady” figure that always shows up in noir movies. She is Bree Daniels, a would-be model and actor who is doing escort work to pay the bills. Donald Sutherland plays Klute, the private detective spying on her because a serial killer is on the loose, and she is in danger. Fonda’s character is cool and reserved, having apparently mastered a kind of emotional numbness as part of the play-acting involved in her work, and part of her genuine alienation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bc218969f20e498031e8d119533412304f4e82b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcb72cce3ad41b72f88c38effc19c95e","title":"parents sent me to therapy you tell us the films that scarred you as kids","story":"After  writers reminisced about the films that caused nightmares in their younger years, you responded with a long list of alternative optionsI was about four years old, being babysat by my cousin who was more interested in snogging her boyfriend and didn’t realize I was watching it. Freaked me out to such an extent that I would scream my head off whenever we went to the beach and a seagull came within a few feet of me, and even now I can’t stand the evil buggers. Thanks cousin Catherine! steenaMy sister and I nagged and nagged our parents to let us watch what may have been the first UK TV showing of Hitchcock’s The Birds. They relented with a “don’t blame us if you have have nightmares”. We were fine up until the moment Rod’s mum finds that guy laid out in his trashed kitchen. The genius of that scene is that there is no big jump shock with a blast of discordant music, just a slow pan to where he lays with both eyes pecked out and a horrified gasp from the poor lady. We had nightmares. ID9879446This movie literally traumatised me for life. Saw this as a kid and there are scenes engraved on my memory that terrify me still. It’s not really a very scary movie, but I think I was just too young to have seen this and the angst of the unknown threat of these crazy birds haunts me still. I think Hitchcock would be rather thrilled actually. ParmenidasThe Titanic story 1958. No great effects just unrelenting tension and lots of stiff upper lips. I don’t remember much about it, I already knew the ending, but it terrified me and to this day I won’t watch anything about the Titanic. I’m 70. thepreeI guess I was about five years old when one evening I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on TV. My mum had gone out shopping and unbeknownst to me my dad had gone upstairs for a nap. The scene where they drink the fizzy drink and float up towards the spinning blade freaked me out and I screamed in horror only to realise I was alone in an “empty” house. (My dad did not wake up). So I ran outside still screaming, leaving our front door wide open. Opposite our house there were builders who were kind enough to take me in and I waited for what seemed like hours for my mum to come home. tpmv75A truly great film, for many reasons, but the real terror for me didn’t come from ground breaking special effects of lupine metamorphosis.The loneliness of a late night tube station, the sheer horror of the masked Nazis slaughtering an all-American family, the strange and creepy emptiness of a London hospital ward at night, and most of all, Brian Glover telling a racist joke over a pint in the Slaughtered Lamb, with an unexplained pentangle on the wall next to the dart board. dylan37I didn’t see the film, but walked past the local cinema and saw a number of posters promoting it. I was terrified by nightmares for weeks afterwards. jonnyjonnyI saw An American Werewolf in London at a local youth club in Hastings when I was 14, well I say saw, I managed half an hour of it and had to leave the room, I was bricking it!For a couple of years after, walking back from my friends’ homes involved going around a dark corner garden plot with old trees and mature bushes, very poorly lit, I would literally run as if I was in a 100m race around that corner until I got home!Even today, werewolves still scare the bejesus out of me. The one in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was particularly traumatic!! TruthSayer666My dad let me watch the first half hour when I was about 10, it was another decade before I could bear to watch the rest. steventudorI still feel nervous outside when the moon is full … My family find it hilarious. Joanne OgarroThe part in Superman 3 where the computer turns the woman into a kind of human robot hybrid terrified me. BradGoodmanOne Saturday afternoon you’re watching a lighthearted Superman adventure about super computers, the next you’re watching some poor woman sucked into said machine, screaming for her life as the machine starts welding bits to her horrified, agonised face. I was seven or eight when I first saw it, it leapfrogged Robocop \u0026amp Terminator as the most terrifying thing I’d ever seen. David PerkinsSuperman III – you know which bit. dothestrandI saw Psycho as a teenager and in the 55 years since then, when alone, I have NEVER had a shower without checking that all doors and windows are locked. pineapplesageI was less than 10 and had already watched a bunch of slasherhorror movies with no effect on my psyche, but Mars Attacks – with those creepy little aliens and their seemingly all-powerful technology – straight up traumatized me! I got barely any sleep for months, nightmares galore when I did fall asleep, and all sorts of anxiety, to the point that parents sent me to therapy. The therapy didn’t help at all and I never even came close to understanding why Mars Attacks freaked me out so bad. I love horror and sci-fi cinema, but it’s been over 20 years and I still haven’t watched Mars Attacks a second time. It did become a running joke for my whole family and about 10 years ago my dad gave a DVD copy to me as a gag birthday gift – which I gave to a neighbor as soon as he left! Jolly McMasterI watched The Exorcist when I was 10, didn’t have an effect on me. Mars Attacks on the other hand, nope. Terrified. I’m scared of movie aliens, even ET. The only one that doesn’t scare me is, ironically, the Xenomorph. VickyRagDollMy most profound horror experience was seeing Dario Argento’s Suspiria for the first time at 12. Other than Hammer fare on TV with my dad, I had never seen a horror film before, and this was thrust on me via a random video rental of my friend’s dad. The mobile video van (ahh the memories) had a “rent 2 for the week” policy, and he rented French Lieutenant’s Woman as the other title. I remember we put in the other tape every so often to “calm down”. I’ve never had such an intense experience watching a movie, and it kickstarted a lifelong love of euro-horror an Argento obsession, and a film degree. I now dread to think how many times I’ve “upgraded” Suspiria in my collection. DidescharlieScary from the start for no reason you can readily determine London61I did a lot of babysitting as a teenager and student. This terrified me. I always made sure I knew exactly where to find the phone in someone else’s house (no mobiles then). I still shiver thinking of it. JanetgilbertIn 1958, when I was seven, my mother took me to see A Tale of Two Cities. I have never forgotten the guillotine scene at the end. Realised for the first time what the death penalty was and imagined the horror of someone having having their head cut off. ormondThe only movie I ever walked out of, about a quarter of the way through. As soon as the man started changing into a wolf, I really thought I was going to faint with horror. I’m an animal lover and a big fan of dogs, so I don’t know exactly what it was but even now, as an elderly woman, I still can’t watch it. I was a grown woman when I had this terrified reaction, and I still don’t know why it hit me so hard. grumpyoldgirlAbsolutely terrified us (teenagers having a pyjamas party). We could not sleep at all that night, and we had to take turn to go to the bathroom while the others kept watch behind the door (there was a little window in that bathroom, and we were scared to death that we might see those red eyes). And I spent the next few months with my duvet pushed back on my bed, so that I could be sure I would not come across a mummified hand in it. gladarvorAngel Heart was a truly disturbing horror film, Robert de Niro was terrifying, couldn’t look at a boiled egg in the same way after seeing that. ukbazzaI saw Edward Scissorhands at about 6 years old, and was utterly terrified for years. I eventually had to swap bedrooms, as I was so convinced he lived in the built-in cupboard in my bedroom at the time. And still had to keep a torch by my bed to check all dark spaces in the new one bedroom.Still haven’t watched it again in the 25+ years since. It may well not actually be that scary, but having to move bedroom again, which would just be a massive hassle and hard to explain to the wife. RuglyMy Dad was on a business trip. So my Mum and I thought we’d watch a film together to keep each other company. She selected The Power (1968). I was nine.It’s not a great film. But it has the esteemed honour of recording celluloid’s first “death by centrifuge”. The bulging eyes of the hapless victim, as he lolls from the pod, still inform occasional nightmares. I am 52. fergerNeverending Story was bone-chilling as a nipper. Now it’s on Netflix, I watched it recently for the first time in about 30 years, which felt like just about enough time to confront that childhood trauma. The interminably slow horse drowning scene in the swamp of despair is still quite intense! I wonder how kids today would react to it.

United have scouted the 19-year-old on several occasions but they and Juve will face competition from, among others, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Manchester City, Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Chelsea, all of whom have scouted him recently. In total more than 20 clubs have watched the young Norwegian.Haaland joined Salzburg from Molde in January and has scored a remarkable 23 goals in 20 appearances for the Austrian side. This season he has 22 goals in 15 games, including six in the Champions League, making him the top scorer in the competition, one ahead of Robert Lewandowski.His value has increased with each goal this season and stands at around €40m (£34.5m). Salzburg bought him for around €9m in January but the club expect that they will be able to sell him for more than €60m in the summer.They are hoping that he will have a season similar to that of Luka Jovic with Eintracht Frankfurt in 2018-19, when the Serb scored 27 goals in 48 games. The Bundesliga club signed Jovic on a two-year loan from Benfica with an obligatory €5m buyout clause before selling him to Real Madrid for €60m last summer.Napoli have also made contact with Haaland’s representatives, before and after his Champions League hat-trick against Genk, but were told that nothing will happen before the end of the season when Salzburg will put a value on him and see whether anyone is prepared to match it orwhether there is an auction to sign him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77cdb7478d62a2e863ceb9edd8f0beaee1a9b40d/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d5ecd8c84b1317c06a9a26591bd3d60","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Mesut Özil in from the cold, Andy Carroll’s West Ham return and Southampton’s fears for another visit to Manchester City Manchester United’s recent form has put a new twist on an old cliché. The international break came at a good time for United, but not just for the usual reasons. Marcus Rashford’s performances before he went away with England were abysmal he looked unhappy, demotivated and in desperate need of a rest. It turned out all he needed was a change. Rashford always seems happy playing for England, and his storming goal to open the scoring in Bulgaria has apparently given him a huge injection of confidence and zeal. He has sparked United’s mini-revival with a number of moments of coruscating brilliance. A tactical change and the return of his on-field kindred spirit Anthony Martial have also helped, with Rashford now playing wide left or as a split striker rather than an isolated No 9. He is still a long way from the finished article, like most 22-year-olds, but he is the most likely of the current squad to become what all emerging teams need: a talisman. RSLiverpool’s last league visit to Villa Park, three and half a years ago, ended in a 6-0 king for the hosts. Afterwards a delighted Jürgen Klopp said his team’s performance was “good for the soul”, which was an apt turn of phrase not least because Villa, back then, were a club whose soul seemed to have been hollowed out. Now, though, they have it back. Dean Smith has a vibrant team who are growing stronger by the week. Do not be fooled by last week’s 3-0 defeat at Manchester City, where Villa were better than the scoreline suggests. Liverpool face a serious test, especially if Jack Grealish recovers from a calf injury in time to play, and Joël Matip’s knee trouble rules him out again. PDIf Mesut Özil doesn’t return to Arsenal’s Premier League team against Wolves on Saturday, he probably never will. His performance at Anfield on Wednesday was a timely reminder that, for all the frustrations, few players in the world have his ability to strip a defence naked with such insouciant élan. His improvised backflick to create Ainsley Maitland-Niles’s goal at Anfield was the latest in a rich portfolio of unique creative genius. The fact he has played only 71 minutes of Premier League football this season is almost an act of cultural vandalism. At his best, there is no one in the world with Özil’s cold-blooded serenity, technique and imagination in the final third. And while he has generally been nowhere near his best under Unai Emery, his performance against Liverpool could serve as an olive branch. Who knows: in one final twist, a returning Ozil could even save Emery’s job. RSQuique Sánchez Flores has wrought a complete tactical transformation at Watford: from four at the back to five from a team that could hardly defend to one that have conceded only one – handball-assisted – goal in their last three league games from one that might occasionally score to one that hardly even tries. Troy Deeney’s injury hasn’t helped João Pedro’s arrival in January – the 18-year-old Brazilian received a work permit this week – might eventually. In the meantime Roberto Pereyra and Gerard Deulofeu are much happier outside the penalty area and tend to stay there, leaving Watford blunted. It’s just as well Watford Borough Council’s big festive display has been put back half an hour to allow fans to make it after the game, because unless Flores has been working on another transformation they’re unlikely to have any fireworks to enjoy at Vicarage Road. SBThere are times when the fixture list is downright sadistic. Just ask Southampton, who have had to follow their 9-0 defeat at home to Leicester with two trips to the Etihad Stadium. They got off pretty lightly with a 3-1 defeat in the Carabao Cup, when City rested key players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and David Silva. Ralph Hasenhüttl may endure a long night of the soul as he considers what a full-strength team could do to his side. City, after all, have already scored 49 goals this season. There have been thousands of football matches involving teams who would both secretly settle for a draw beforehand. This might be the first, certainly in Premier League history, in which both sides would accept a 4-0 home win. RSNo side has conceded fewer goals than Sheffield United in the Premier League. They have let in eight, the same number as Leicester and Manchester City, and another clean sheet at home to Burnley would give them a counter-puncher’s chance of a victory that could take them as high as fifth in the table. United’s defensive record compares especially well to their fellow promoted sides: they have conceded half as many as Aston Villa (16), and a third as many as Norwich (24). The back three of Chris Basham, John Egan and Jack O’Connell, the kind of EFL stalwarts who are supposed to get vertigo in the Premier League, have all been outstanding this season. The club broke their transfer record four times in the summer, all on attacking players. But it is the old defence that is pushing them to unexpected heights. RSAndy Carroll returned to training this week after a slight groin strain, and looks set to return to West Ham for the first time since leaving on a free transfer this summer. “I hope he will be fit,” the West Ham manager, Manuel Pellegrini, said, charitably. “He, like Winston Reid, is a player who has had many injuries, long injuries, and they deserve to have a normal career.” It is probably already too late for that: a few months from his 31st birthday, and with this game being played 13 years to the day since he made his senior debut, the famously injury-prone Carroll has started precisely 100 fewer club matches than Crystal Palace’s 26-year-old Wilfried Zaha. If he continued to start as frequently as he has across his career so far, he would catch up with Mark Noble’s current number of career starts sometime in October 2036. Football of course has its immutable law of the ex, which states that a player will always over-perform against his former teams, but Carroll appears to be an exception here as well: having played six times for West Ham against Newcastle without scoring (and another three barren games against them for Liverpool), it would be somewhat galling if he were to score against the Hammers at his first attempt. SBThe two most prolific scorers in last season’s Championship will have a big say in who wins Saturday’s important Premier League encounter at the Amex. Teemu Pukki struck six times in his first five top-flight matches this season but has failed to find the net in his past five. Meanwhile Neal Maupay has thrived at Brighton even if his goal tally (four) is lower than Pukki’s. The Frenchman, a £20m summer signing from Brentford, is much more than a goal-getter and his intelligent movement and passing have been integral to the attacking style introduced at Brighton by Graham Potter. Maupay is as likely to score net this weekend as he is to create a goal for his striker partner, Aaron Connolly, who is far more Pukki-like in his play. Expect Brighton to prevail in an entertaining duel on the south coast. PDOn the day Everton (16th) play Tottenham (11th), Selhurst Park hosts the most unlikely November top-six fixture for some time. Leicester’s success this season was not entirely unexpected, but Palace’s position is a genuine surprise – though it would be even more impressive should they still be there once their current testing run of fixtures (Manchester City, Arsenal, Leicester, Chelsea, Liverpool) comes to a conclusion later this month. Leicester fans are unlikely to relish a visit to a team that did the double over them in each of the past two seasons, even if not all of those defeats had entirely negative consequences. After all, it was Palace’s 4-1 victory at the King Power Stadium in February that precipitated the sacking of Claude Puel the following day, and the transformational arrival of Brendan Rodgers soon afterwards. After that Palace game they had lost seven games out of nine they have lost five of 21 since, winning 12.

In the end, Arsenal moved into the Champions League quarter-finals with a 13-2 win on aggregate. Their fourth consecutive victory was sealed with hat-tricks from player of the match Daniëlle van de Donk and Vivianne Miedema.The big question for Arsenal this season was how they would fare with the renewed burden and benefit of Champions League football after so long. Two weeks ago, Arsenal travelled to Prague on the back of their 2-1 defeat to Chelsea. Their 5-2 victory in the away leg was an exhibition of their resilience. Miedema was merciless, crushing the home side with a hat-trick by the 29th minute and four goals in total. The Netherlands striker was decisive again on Sunday, scoring the only goal in Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Manchester City, a game notable for Arsenal’s slick passing and relentless pressing.With his side already on the verge of a Champions League quarter-final, Joe Montemurro rotated his squad here, making five changes from the team that started against Manchester City. The fact that he was even capable of doing so was a source of joy. Arsenal’s title run last season may have been one of their most dominant in history, yet throughout last season the team was ravaged by injuries and were left with no choice but to focus on one competition.The mental scars from the previous season’s injury list remain and the mere mention of injuries was enough for Montemurro to flinch and superstitiously thump a wooden table. “There’s a little bit of wood here, so please don’t mention that again,” he said. He was only half-joking. What a comfort it must be to finally be capable of rotating his players yet still watching them soar.Indeed, as Arsenal immediately took the game by the scruff of its neck, it was clear that the players rotated in were determined to impress. Leonie Maier stood out early on, providing a lively outlet for the midfield as she tore down the right wing and whipped in crosses at will. Eventually, after creating many near misses, Van de Donk opened the scoring from Maier’s third probing low cross. Despite a brilliant performance from so many, the Dutchwoman was the best player on the pitch, both for her brilliantly taken hat-trick and the way she helped Kim Little control the tempo from midfield throughout.This was also a significant occasion for Jill Roord, who is still looking to make her mark after joining Arsenal this season. Throughout the game she showed her movement, passing and energy, but what will most be remembered is the way she blasted her name on to the scoresheet with a rocket of a half-volley for Arsenal’s third goal.And then there was Miedema, one of the best players around. It’s hard to believe that she is only 23. Nominated for the Ballon d’Or last month, Miedema arrived at Boreham Wood one goal away from crossing the half-century mark for Arsenal. Of course, she couldn’t bear to just score one, her hat-trick propelling her to 52 goals in just 50 starts.Miedema’s first goal did not come until the final minute of the first half as she calmly slipped past Prague goalkeeper Barbora Votikova and rolled the ball into the net. But as is so often the case, she had the final word, heading home the eighth goal of the night and her seventh goal across the two legs to drive Arsenal into the last eight in the most emphatic manner possible.It has been a while. The 2006 European Cup winners have not contested the tournament since the 2013-14 season and had to watch other English teams claim the Champions League places. Under the lights at Meadow Park, Arsenal made it clear that they are back and they are determined to make up for lost time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e378dea099cb9f4cab54be73c5272f9a783474e/0_1026_8000_4801/master/8000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ced69fca09cc072b5fe61d5ccc846c4","title":"people of tamba senegal migration photo essay","story":"People of Tamba is a project by the Italian artist Giovanni Hänninen, consisting of 200 portraits taken across the Tambacounda region in Senegal and accompanied by SenegalSicily, a series of documentaries created with the film-maker Alberto Amoretti, courtesy of the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation and Le KorsaPeople of Tamba, inspired by German photographer August Sander’s seminal work, People of the 20th Century, was conceived as a catalogue of the society of Tambacounda, the largest city in the most remote and rural region of Senegal, and the point of departure for the majority of Senegalese migration.The series portrays various professionals – from doctors and bankers to teachers and farmers – in their work environments to highlight their roles and contribution to society.This dignified series of portraits aims to counter negative and number-based reporting about migration in western media by bringing iniduals and their personal stories to the fore.Also featured as part of this project are architectural and landscape images of street installations of the portraits exhibited in key migration destinations in Africa and Europe, including Dakar, Marrakech, Berlin and Milan.In each location, large-scale photographs were printed and displayed across the city, where people could appreciate the pictures and see themselves reflected in their own society.The photographic project is accompanied by SenegalSicily, which is a series of short documentaries created with the Italian film-maker Alberto Amoretti. Both projects aim to explore different aspects of clandestine migration.The first documentary of the series is a dialogue between a mother, Aisadou, speaking from her village in the east part of Senegal, and her son Alpha in Sicily, who has left home to find a better future. Aisadou lives in Sinthian, a village in Tambacounda. This is where the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation built Thread, a community centre and artists’ residence.Aisadou and her son AlphaAlpha lives in Mazzarino, a small town in the centre of Sicily. Mother and son talk about their hopes and their regrets Aisadou talks of her worries as a mother and Alpha about the hardships he has faced.The documentaries each feature the experiences, dreams and reflections of migrants and their relatives who remained in Senegal. These include the monologues of Aisadou and Alpha, discussions with migrant residents of San Berillo in Catania and interviews with families of migrants who died at sea.“After screening in Sinthian, we met a man who had begun to save money to start the trip. Now we don’t know what happened to him, but what it is important is that after seeing the film, he reconsidered,” Hänninen says.The project wants to show to the young people of Tambacounda who are considering leaving a sincere account of the risks of the voyage and the reality of those who made it to Europe.Young Women of Le FoyerLe Foyer de Jeunes Filles in Tambacounda is a home for girls and young women who come to the city to attend secondary school. Coming from villages that only have primary schools, the girls find a safe place to live while they complete their education. If it was not for Le Foyer, they would have abandoned their studies and, most likely, remained in their villages and married underage. The girls at Le Foyer talk about their desire to get the training they need to help their country. They not only want to graduate, but also to become leaders of a new Senegal.Khadidiatou Nadya and Khady Camara, young women of Le FoyerTo help disseminate the message of the films, the Albers Foundation and Le Korsa have launched a series of film screenings and discussions throughout the Tambacounda region, specifically targeting remote and rural areas. The screenings unite families, teachers and local leaders in dialogue about the experiences of migrants, and how the financial resources devoted to migration may be better used to improve life locally.The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation and Le Korsa will display a selection of images and films from both projects at Also Known as Africa (AKAA) art and design fair held in Paris, 9-11 November 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a9120816467d5f52548bf06cd26c399bcfa57a/192_0_4334_2600/master/4334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe3ade45ad09b1b18afce5403ec69f16","title":"bat faces landmark legal case over malawi families poverty wages","story":"Exclusive: Lawyers seeking compensation in UK for child labourers and their parentsHuman rights lawyers are preparing to bring a landmark case against British American Tobacco on behalf of hundreds of children and their families forced by poverty wages to work in conditions of gruelling hard labour in the fields of Malawi.Leigh Day’s lawyers are seeking compensation for more than 350 child labourers and their parents in the high court in London, arguing that the British company is guilty of “unjust enrichment”. Leigh Day says it anticipates the number of child labourer claimants to rise as high as 15,000. While BAT claims it has told farmers not to use their children as unpaid labour, the lawyers say the families cannot afford to work their fields otherwise, because they receive so little money for their crop.The case, potentially one of the biggest that human rights lawyers have ever brought, could transform the lives of children in poor countries who are forced to work to survive not only in tobacco but also in other industries such as the garment trade.It follows exposure of the scale and brutal reality of child labour in the tobacco fields by the  last year, which Martyn Day, a founding partner and head of the firm, said had provoked them to act. “If it hadn’t been for the , this case would not be happening,” he said.Day added: “It is totally depressing that one of the largest companies in the world, and certainly one of the largest British companies, is involved in an area where the employment of children is such a fundamental part of what happens. It has been going on for decades, and as a result of all of that the farmers of Malawi are caught in a groundhog day, where one generation after another is having to farm tobacco and is caught in a poverty trap.”Many of the families are from Phalombe, one of the poorest regions in the south of the country. They are recruited to tobacco farms in the north with the promise of food, accommodation and a lump sum in cash for their crop. Their accommodation is a straw hut they must build themselves the food is a monthly sack of maize, which is insufficient to feed the family and which is stopped before their tenancy ends. The lump sum they are paid at the end of the season dwindles often to less than half what is offered after deductions for tools and loans that the families have to take out to pay for essentials.According to the letter of claim, seen by the , last season most claimants earned no more than £100 to £200 for 10 months’ work for a family of five. Their lawyers say the work amounts to forced or bonded labour because they are misled when recruited, are afraid to leave and quickly get into debt. Children as young as three are involved in tobacco farming, the letter of claim says, often during harvest when the work can be especially hazardous. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of toxic pesticides, fertiliser and green tobacco sickness, from nicotine absorption while handling the leaves. Symptoms include breathing difficulties, cramps and vomiting.Some children go to school, as the law requires, but often only sporadically. Almost all work from sunrise in the fields before school and then when they get home, as well as through the weekend. At harvest time, classrooms empty.BAT is one of the most profitable companies in the world, making an operating profit last year of £9.3bn on sales of £24.5bn. Like other big tobacco companies, it has distanced itself from the farmers by commissioning a separate company to buy a stipulated amount of tobacco leaf each year. Alliance One signs contracts with land-owning farmers in Malawi, who then recruit tenant farmer families to work the fields.The lawyers, who have sent BAT the letter of claim and say they expect to issue proceedings this year, argue that responsibility for the conditions of the tenant families rests ultimately with BAT, which decides the price it will pay for tobacco leaf. In April, Leigh Day won a watershed case against Vedanta, a British mining company, which the high court held responsible for the actions of its subsidiary in polluting farmland in Zambia. That case opened the way to hold other British companies responsible for harm caused by the actions of those who work for them overseas.A report in 2011 estimated there were 1.3 million children under the age of 14 working in tobacco around the world. In 2017, an International Labour Organisation report said child labour in tobacco was on the increase and “rampant”. Day said: “If we are successful in Malawi, I would very much hope it would persuade BAT and the other tobacco companies that use very similar models to change those models and make sure people are properly compensated for the work and totally discourage children from working so they can go to school.” BAT said in a statement that it took the issue of child labour very seriously and “strongly agrees that children must never be exploited, exposed to danger or denied an education”.Simon Cleverly, the group head of corporate affairs, said BAT’s core policies “specifically state that we do not condone forced, bonded or involuntary labour and that we do not condone or employ child labour, and seek to ensure that the welfare, health and safety of children are paramount at all times”.He said BAT made it clear to contract farmers and suppliers that exploitative child labour and forced and bonded labour would not be tolerated.BAT leaf operations and contracted suppliers were required to participate in the industry-wide sustainable tobacco programme, he said, which was aligned with United Nations standards, including on child labour and income for farm workers.“As we have received a letter of claim relating to these allegations, it would be inappropriate for us to provide further comment at this time,” Cleverly said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d3d9f5c5283ddeaec1aa4558da2e0f75663411/0_82_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a1b8959612bab4a0790772aad1685fd","title":"conker contests and pumpkin picking autumn in the uk in pictures","story":"Keats called it the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness we call it an excellent excuse for a grand day out.

The practise of directly addressing inequality underpins countless social justice movements, from civil rights to Standing Rock.The contemporary idea of a “call-out”, however, generally refers to interpersonal confrontations occurring between iniduals on social media. In theory, call-outs should be very simple – someone does something wrong, people tell them, and they avoid doing it again in the future. Yet you only need to spend a short amount of time on the internet to know that call-out culture is in fact extremely isive.Former president Obama pointed out this week at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago that call-outs can give the illusion that you’re effecting change, even if that is not true. “If I tweet or hashtag about how you didn’t do something right, or used the wrong word or verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself, because, ‘Man, you see how woke I was. I called you out.’ That’s not activism,” Obama said.Some people feel that call-outs are an excuse for petty drama – a way to stir up gossip more than to promote social justice. Think of when Coleen Rooney launched a real-life soap opera by accusing fellow British football wife Rebekah Vardy of subterfuge last month, or the heady influencer drama that escalated between YouTubers Tati Westbrook and James Charles this summer.Yet the most potent critiques of call-out culture come from those who feel it is an excuse for crude vigilante justice – “zealotry … fueled by people working out their psychological wounds”, as the New York Times columnist David Brooks called it earlier this year. A “trial by fire” method of responding to any alleged violation of propriety, writes the Atlantic’s Conor Friedersdorf.A frequently cited problem with call-outs is that it’s all too easy to get carried away and overpunish people, turning alleged perpetrators of upsetting acts into victims themselves. “What can often start out as well-intentioned and necessary criticism far too quickly devolves into brutish displays of virtual tar-and-feathering,” writes the activist and writer Ruby Hamad.This leaves one question: how can we benefit from the social good call-out culture can help achieve, without succumbing to the toxicity and futility that has come to be associated with it?Some advocate a softer approach to call-outs. By ganging up on an inidual, “you’re taking this moral high ground, with a lot of righteous indignation, and inviting others to participate in a public shaming exercise”, which is rarely productive, says Anna Richards, a therapist specializing in conflict mediation.Richards cautions against taking a “reductionist approach” when calling out an inidual. When we rationalize our own mistakes, “we tend to give ourselves really high context”, she says. “We think, well I was going through something, and there were certain norms at the time, I was following everybody else,” but when someone offends us we’re less willing to see what contributed to their behavior, aside from inherent badness.While there is no one absolute right way to call someone out, Richards believes that learning to analyze our own motivations when offering criticism, and considering the context and possible consequences of the situation we’re contributing to helps call-out culture work productively.Of course, it’s also up to the inidual whose behavior has been called into question to be open, humble and willing to see such incidents as opportunities to learn, rather than a one-way ticket into a cartoon dust ball fight. After all, one tried and true way to begin resolving interpersonal conflict is to sincerely apologize when you have, intentionally or not, caused harm.Unfortunately, apologizing can be challenging for some. According to Richards, in order for someone to apologize they need to have a fairly robust sense of self-worth, and often people are insecure and pathologically afraid of being wrong.“People feel as though they’re already on shaky ground and if they have some sort of mistake highlighted it would be drawing from an empty cup,” she says. “Generally what I see is just a total collapse, where the person’s sense of self is eroded, or a kind of counter-attack, where they double down on their position and don’t want to learn.”In other cases, a self-preservation instinct will lead people to offer a submission—a calculated, face-saving apology that doesn’t suggest true accountability. (Such as, most believe, those offered by actor Gina Rodriguez earlier this month, and comedian Shane Gillis this summer, both for using offensive racial epithets.)Richards may believe in an empathetic approach to conflict resolution, yet she is wary of putting the onus of peacekeeping and politesse on the injured party. Rather, she suggests anger may be better channeled at the root of the systemic forces that give iniduals the entitlement to behave in a way that’s uncaring of others. What that means is that there are circumstances when it may be better to confront not iniduals, but political or corporate institutions able to implement change or influence others on a larger scale. After all, Richards mediates conflict all day long, and she says that an inidual changing their behavior is “not as common as we would like”.As the old saying goes: choose your battles wisely.Still, positive outcomes are possible. According to writer and activist Kitty Stryker, the recent backlash to the Netflix animated series Big Mouth’s inaccurate definition of bisexuality is an example of functional call-out culture. Members of the queer community voiced their anger when the show misrepresented bisexuals as not being attracted to trans iniduals. Producer Andrew Goldberg responded with an apology and pledge to do better in the future.Could Goldberg have done more? Sure, his critics have suggested he hire a more erse writing room, for one, and it remains to be seen how he’ll make his work more inclusive. Yet atonement is a process the only way to begin it is by acknowledging a mistake and expressing the sincere intent to learn from it.“I think what differentiates a call-out from bullying is that it shouldn’t be about punishing someone for something they have done, rather it should be about establishing a new pattern of behavior,” says Stryker, who has been on both the giving and receiving ends of call-outs throughout her career. “Basically, when someone calls you out they want you to start showing through your actions that you care about the issue you’ve been called out on.”If you’re confronted about something offensive you may have said or done, Stryker acknowledges making an effort to listen and learn may be difficult. “You are going to get petty at times, you’re going to get mad, you’re going to be like, ‘why should I listen to this person?’ But you have to take a deep breath and not tweet when you’re in that state, and be like ‘OK, they are very mad at me, but what is the fundamental seed in here that I can take away?’“When I get called out, I think, ‘awesome this is a chance for me to learn,’” says Stryker. “I don’t need forgiveness on top of that. I just don’t want to hurt my friends.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc5c9833432c54381ec7a1964f9b8a1bced33833/0_340_6612_3968/master/6612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ccbd0c8fd7b51725533a17220dae1f4","title":"michael kiwanuka kiwanuka review one of the greatest albums of the decade","story":"(Polydor)The soulful singer’s third LP is timeless and contemporary at the same time, with shades of everything from What’s Going On to ScreamadelicaMichael Kiwanuka’s first two albums established him as a folksy symphonic soul man akin to Bill Withers and Terry Callier, and set the bar pretty high. This one knocks it skyward. Together with producer-to-the-stars Danger Mouse and London hip-hop producer Inflo, the British-Ugandan 32-year-old has broadened his territory to stretch from Donny Hathaway-style melancholy soul through to Rolling Stones-y gospel rock, psychedelic soul and breakbeat. There are strings and harps, samples of civil rights campaigners, Hendrix-type frazzled guitars and Burt Bacharach-type orchestrations. The dreamlike, revelatory quality is reminiscent of Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On and Primal Scream’s Screamadelica.Unusually, in these streaming-led times, Kiwanuka is a contemplative song cycle intended to be listened to in one extended sitting, which he says is “a reaction against this fast-paced, throwaway, machine-led world”. It sounds timeless and contemporary the instrumental interludes and the stylistic and tempo shifts all hang together because of his warm, sincere vocals and fantastic songwriting. At the core is Kiwanuka’s inner battle between anxiety, self-doubt, spirituality and wisdom, which is then set against racism and rueful glances at the state of the world. Thus, killer opener You Ain’t the Problem is both an encouraging nudge to himself and a sharp put-down of attitudes towards immigration: “If you don’t belong, you’re not the problem.”Hero compares the murder of 60s activist Fred Hampton with recent US police shootings (“on the news again, I guess they killed another”), also referenced in the insistent Rolling (“No tears for the young, a bullet if you’re wrong”). Piano Joint (This Kind of Love) and Hard to Say Goodbye are beautifully pensive and Final Days ponders nuclear apocalypse. But for all its melancholy, Kiwanuka is never downbeat. There are moments – such as the “Time is the healer” gospel choir in I’ve Been Dazed, or hopeful closer Light – when positivity bursts through with such dazzling effect you want to cheer. Kiwanuka is a bold, expansive, heartfelt, sublime album. He’s snuck in at the final whistle, but surely this is among the decade’s best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce4302798b6e5ec1448becd52ff145bcf00279bb/121_0_4610_2766/master/4610.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82f90c77feb59c56d75954920ded1b04","title":"corbyns super rich targets who are they and what could he do","story":"Labour leader names Mike Ashley and Rupert Murdoch among business figures he would target as PMJeremy Corbyn has promised that a Labour government would go after super-rich people who exploit a “rigged system” to benefit themselves at the expense of the many.The Labour leader named five members of “the elite” he would target if he becomes prime minister: Mike Ashley, the owner of Sports Direct Crispin Odey, a hedge fund boss who made millions betting against the pound in the run-up to the EU referendum Jim Ratcliffe, the chief executive of the petrochemicals company Ineos Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Sun and the Times and Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, who controls a large central London property empire.“This election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country, take on the vested interests holding people back and ensure that no community is left behind,” Corbyn said as he launched Labour’s general election campaign in south London. “Together, we can pull down a corrupt system and build a fairer country that genuinely does care for all.”The charge sheet Corbyn said Ashley was an example of a “bad boss” who exploits workers by using zero-hours contracts. He said one of Ashley’s employees had felt “forced to give birth in a warehouse toilet because she was terrified of missing her shift”. MPs have previously accused Ashley of running Sports Direct like a “Victorian workhouse”, after a  undercover investigation in 2015 revealed conditions at its warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. The investigation discovered that Shirebrook workers were receiving effective hourly pay rates below the minimum wage. Sports Direct was fined and forced to make up the underpayments.What could be done? Labour has previously proposed banning zero-hours contracts, giving workers a guaranteed minimum number of hours’ work a week, lifting the minimum wage to £10 an hour and helping to prosecute exploitative bosses, in what it called the “biggest extension of workers’ rights” in British history.The charge sheet Ineos is the biggest chemicals firm in the world and owns petrol refineries including Grangemouth in Scotland. His companies are responsible for about a third of industrial greenhouse gas emissions in Scotland, according to the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. Ineos is also exploring the possibility of fracking for shale gas. At the Labour event, Corbyn asked: “Whose side are you on? The big polluters like Jim Ratcliffe, Britain’s richest man, who makes his money by polluting the environment? Or the children growing up in our cities with reduced lung capacity because of choking pollution?”What could be done? The UK has set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, and Labour wants a target of as early as the 2030s as part of a “green new deal”.After mini-earthquakes at a test drilling site in Lancashire, Labour called on the government to ban fracking, citing “fear, disruption and potential damage to property”.Who is he? Odey is the founder of Odey Asset Management and one the country’s richest financiers, with an estimated £775m fortune, according to the Sunday Times rich list. He donated almost £900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns and gave £10,000 to Boris Johnson’s campaign for the Conservative leadership.The charge sheet Odey made £220m on the night of the 2016 referendum by betting against the pound and British companies. He placed the bets after his hedge fund bought private polling data from YouGov that suggested the leave campaign would win. He gloated the next day on the BBC: “There’s that Italian expression, il mattino ha l’oro in bocca – the morning has gold in its mouth – and never has one felt so much that idea as this morning.”Labour has accused Odey of continuing to bet against the pound and British companies. Corbyn said: “Greedy bankers like Crispin Odey … make millions betting against our country.” Odey dismissed the accusation as “crap” and said his fund was neutral on its outlook for the UK economy and British businesses. What could be done? John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has demanded an inquiry into conflicts of interest among hedge funds that shorted the pound or UK shares in the run-up to a possible no-deal Brexit and donated to the Conservatives. Some countries have brought in temporary bans on short-selling of certain stocks, but it would be hard for a potential Labour government to introduce an outright ban on the practice. Financial experts said it would be easy to find a way around any restrictions by buying or selling stocks in other countries. A ban on currency trading or hedge funds would also be almost impossible as they would just shift overseas. A better option could be a tax on financial transactions, which McDonnell has backed in the past.Who is he? At 28 years old, the seventh Duke of Westminster is the the UK’s youngest billionaire and the 14th richest person in the country, with an estimated £10bn fortune. He inherited his wealth and title after the death of his father, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, in August 2016. The family paid no inheritance tax on the bulk of the fortune – which comes from vast property holdings across Mayfair and Belgravia – as most of the wealth had already been transferred to family trusts.The charge sheet The duke had been accused of “social cleansing” over a plan to evict 40 families from council homes in order to convert their block into posh flats. His property company Grosvenor wanted to demolish Walden House in Belgravia in order to build a new complex of high-end flats and shops. The building is owned by Grosvenor but historically has been leased to Westminster council for social housing provision. Corbyn described the duke as a “dodgy landlord” who had “tried to evict whole blocks of families to make way for luxury apartments”.What could be done? Grosvenor has said it will modify its plans and increase the proportion of affordable housing in the project. Local councils could be forced to demand more affordable homes. More generally, more could be done to tackle rogue landlords across the country by encouraging councils to take full advantage of government banning orders. In the first year of the scheme, just four landlords were placed on the database.Who is he? The 88-year-old Australian media mogul owns newspapers across the US, Australia and the UK, including the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times.The charge sheet Corbyn described Murdoch as a “billionaire media baron … whose empire pumps out propaganda to support a rigged system”. His red top newspapers were at the centre of the phone-hacking scandal, which led to the closure of the News of the World.What could be done?

Rosie Duffield thanked Bercow for his kindness to her family when she was sworn in as the 2017-elected Labour MP for Canterbury, saying her father, who has Alzheimer’s, still repeatedly talks with fondness of the day.It was, overall, probably a fitting swan song for the 157th Speaker, who is standing down at December’s election after 22 years in the Commons, the first dozen as a Tory MP and shadow minister.While Bercow took over amid the furore of the MPs’ expenses scandal, his prominence has grown since the 2016 Brexit referendum, where he has proved a regular thorn in the side of government, allowing backbench MPs significant scope to shape – some critics would say obstruct – the departure process.Commons-watchers say Bercow has reshaped the role of his office, for example with the huge increase in urgent questions to ministers. “I think he’s changed the nature of the role,” said Ruth Fox, director of the parliamentary research group the Hansard Society.Bercow’s greatest impact was perhaps “in making parliament a more outward-facing institution”, Fox said, such as his work with the education centre and youth parliament.Even his notoriety must be seen in the political context of the era, she added: “He’s a Speaker who for three-quarters of his time in office has presided over a hung parliament. He’s had to make decisions at a time when political parties are fragmented, and haven’t really operated in parliament as they normally do.“We’ll only really get a sense of his record and his reputation when he’s gone and we see how his successor fares. Because if his successor faces some or all of these same challenges, we’ll see how they deal with it.“We’ll also see if backbench MPs are happy if his successor is less inclined to defend their rights and more inclined to allow the executive an easier ride.”There are, however, some more obviously troubling aspects to Bercow’s tenure. He has been accused by former aides of bullying. He vehemently denies the claims, but his departure means the investigatory process could stop.And while Bercow’s colourfully-worded put-downs might have earned him a global audience, some MPs vehemently dislike what they say can be a bullying, condescending manner in the chair.Labour’s Chris Bryant, among nine MPs seeking to replace Bercow in an election process scheduled for Monday, told the  last week he had recently walked out of the Commons chamber as he disliked the way the Speaker was chastising one Conservative.What seems clear is that whatever of Bercow’s procedural innovations remain under a new Speaker, their style will be different. It is perhaps no surprise that the two favourites are Lindsay Hoyle and Eleanor Laing, both deputy Speakers, who are known quantities and significantly more understated in their approach.As for Bercow, who has three school-age children, he must now vacate the lavish apartment inside parliament that comes with the job, and at the age of 56, seek a new career.Previous Speakers have been made peers, but several government briefings have indicated that Bercow will be denied this. However, the attention-grabbing manner that perhaps played a role in this could bring an alternative path, with several reports that he will be in demand on the US lecture circuit.Lindsay Hoyle: the Labour MP for Chorley since 1997, and a deputy Speaker since 2010, he is seen as the front-runner for the post.Eleanor Laing: another deputy Speaker, Laing is a Conservative, and is MP for Epping Forest. She could pip Hoyle to the job.Chris Bryant: a popular Labour backbencher and self-professed Commons geek – he has written a two-volume history of parliament – Bryant is another possible winner.Rosie Winterton: also a deputy Speaker, since 2017, Winterton was formerly Labour’s chief whip.Harriet Harman: the longest-serving female MP and a reformer of its procedures for decades, the Labour MP has campaigned energetically but is now seen as perhaps an outsider.Meg Hillier: an east London Labour MP, she chairs the influential Public Accounts Committee.Edward Leigh: veteran Tory backbencher – he has represented Gainsborough since 1983.Henry Bellingham: a Tory of the same vintage, being MP for North West Norfolk since 1983.Shailesh Vara: yet another Conservative.

Once inside the respiratory tract, the virus penetrates immune cells that sit at the interface between the lungs and bloodstream. From there, the virus replicates and spreads to immune cells throughout the body.Previously, scientists had inferred a longer-term impact on the immune system because deaths from other infections were seen to go up after a measles outbreak, and because the virus directly attacks the immune system. The latest work for the first time uncovers the extent of the damage.The researchers recruited volunteers from three schools in the Netherlands. They took blood samples from healthy, unvaccinated children aged four to 17 and followed up with 77 of the children who were infected in a measles outbreak in 2013 for repeat sampling.The first paper, led by Velislava Petrova, of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Cambridge University, says measles erodes two separate lines of defence of the immune system.To tackle previously unseen infections, the immune system relies on constantly pumping out a erse range of immune cells – thousands of different varieties, each with slightly different receptors on their surfaces, with a collective ability to recognise almost any pathogen.“The more erse range of them we have, the better,” said Petrova. However, after measles, the children had a far more restricted range.The immune system also creates long-lived memory cells, which remain permanently in circulation, allowing the body to rapidly recognise and eliminate previously encountered infections.However, after measles, a substantial proportion of immune memory cells had disappeared from the children’s blood, in what the scientists described as “immune amnesia”. This could even mean that children who become infected with measles may need to be revaccinated for previous diseases.“We show that measles directly causes the loss of protection to other infectious diseases,” said Petrova.The children in the study were followed up around six weeks after their measles infection, and so it has not yet been established how long it would take for the immune system to recover.“One can speculate that it’s very likely to recover, based on recovery seen in people on immunosuppressive drugs,” said Velislava. “Maybe after five years you would recover.”The research found that the MMR vaccine itself did not produce immune suppression, meaning that recipients get the benefit of lifelong immunity to measles infection without the damaging effects of natural infection.Petrova said that addressing scepticism around vaccines was a complex task. “We shouldn’t think that scientific data is enough to convince people,” she said. “We need to bring enough reliable information to people at the point of care. Not create polarisation in society around this.”Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, who was not involved in the work, said: “In our current climate of falling vaccine uptake rates, this serves as a timely reminder of why MMR immunisation is so important – not only to protect against the viruses the vaccine is designed to target, but also to prevent avoidable follow-on complications that can occur after measles infection.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac8b173e5e40f6840d6b036d1044399599ea67e/660_434_1307_784/master/1307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2daced8c6bc64d0631a5fbff40fe873b","title":"sophie morgan on researching her family tree we are finding a secret dark side","story":"TV presenter Morgan always had questions about her lineage.  Sue George helps her find out more than she imaginedWhen you start researching your family tree, you never know what you might find. Sophie Morgan – TV presenter and campaigner – knew very little about her family’s dark past.“We knew a few things about my mother’s side,” she says, “but nothing about my father’s.”As I delve into Morgan’s dad’s side of the family, using Ancestry, I’m soon introduced to someone whose life was punctuated with multiple marriages, domestic violence and even a proposed suicide pact.The life of John Andrew Towle (JAT senior), Morgan’s great-great-grandfather, not only highlights the absence of contraception in the 19th century and the infancy of modern medicine, but also the lack of women’s rights.JAT senior was born in Salford in 1826 and began his working life as a pawnbroker, like his father before him. JAT senior must have been energetic and ambitious, as he later became an engineer, while remaining a pawnbroker.He was married three times, the first two of which were to women who lived near him in the lively Broughton Road shopping district. His first marriage, to Catherine Dixon, took place in 1855.His second marriage, to Morgan’s two-times great-grandmother Mary Ann, took place in Paris in 1867. They went on to have six children together in the seven years they were married. Mary Ann died in 1874, around the same time their final – and her 10th – child, Octavia Ventnor Towle, was born.But it was his third marriage that was the most tumultuous. JAT senior married Jane Dunster Holliday in June 1875. But they soon went their separate ways. In her orce petition, dated August 1876, she states that he harmed her physically six weeks after their marriage, when he bruised her arm and tried to “pitch her out of the window”. Soon afterwards, he suggested that they take poison together. The litany of cruelty continued until January 1876. She finally left him after he violently pushed her and “hit her with severe blows, feeling the effects of it for some time”.At that time, orce was both unusual and expensive. The grounds for women to orce their husbands were fewer than those for men and their wives women had to prove cruelty, whereas for men, adultery on the part of their wife was sufficient.JAT senior didn’t marry again after the orce. He lived until 1914, dying aged 88.Many of his children, including Octavia, didn’t marry. Morgan’s great-grandfather, also called John Andrew Towle, finally married at the age of 49, and had his only child three years later.Unsurprisingly, Morgan was shocked to find out about her ancestor’s past. “We are uncovering a secret life, a dark side we didn’t know about, which is intriguing,” she says. “Clearly he was a very dodgy character. I wonder how the rest of the family will react? When you find out something you don’t like, how do you feel?”Meanwhile, Morgan’s mother’s side had their fair share of scandal too – from illegitimacy to fraudulent marriage certificates.Ancestry reveals that several branches of her mother’s line came from the Scottish Borders between Jedburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed. Morgan’s great-grandmother, Ann Drummond Ferguson, lived and died in Scotland. Ann was born in August 1886 the word “illegitimate” was marked clearly on her birth certificate. However, when her mother, Agnes, married her father, John Ferguson, six months later, Ann’s birth certificate was amended to show her legitimacy.However, the illegitimacy wouldn’t have been the only thing raising eyebrows. Agnes was 30 when she gave birth to Ann, while John was just 18 – having been 17 when Ann was conceived. John clearly felt the strain of going against societal norms, as he lied about his age on the marriage certificate, listing himself as 21 when he was still 18, while Agnes, who by then was 31, said she was 30.They married in the manse (the minister’s house), rather than in church. This implies that they had a small wedding, which was quite normal because the couple were not well off.Their marriage endured, and they had another six children. However, a new family mystery emerges around Eliza Taylor Drummond – born illegitimate to Agnes two years before Ann, and not John’s child. Eliza was part of their household until 1901, but there is no trace of her after that.Finding out about her mother’s roots in Scotland made Morgan keen to visit the part of the country where her ancestors were based. “I love the idea that there’s this woman in the family who married a much younger man,” she says.The whole experience has made Morgan determined to keep searching for answers about her family’s past.“I’m so curious to take it further,” she says. “I want to go further back, and I’d like to find living relatives.”Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

He makes some pretty gutsy throws out there, doesn’t he? Goodness gracious.”San Francisco (8-0) fell behind 7-0 but responded with three touchdowns – one as time expired in the second quarter after Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury called a timeout and gave the 49ers a second chance on fourth down – to take a 21-7 halftime lead.The 49ers were in control until about five minutes left in the fourth quarter, when Andy Isabella caught a short pass and sprinted for an 88-yard touchdown to help the Cardinals pull to 28-25.But the 49ers were able to run out the clock on their ensuing offensive drive to end Arizona’s comeback. Garoppolo had two crucial third-down completions to keep the final drive alive, including one to Emmanuel Sanders who caught seven passes for 112 yards and a touchdown.Garoppolo completed 28 of 37 throws including touchdowns of 30, seven, one and 21 yards.“Our team has done a good job of winning in different ways this year,” Garoppolo said. “Whether it’s offense, special teams, defense or mixing and matching all of them. That’s how you create a good football team. You’re not relying on one part and everyone’s playing tomorrow. Complimentary football.“That’s where we’re at right now.”Even in victory and at 8-0, Niners cornerback Richard Sherman was downright grumpy when asked about the defense. Arizona had 357 total yards.“It’s not about the results. The results are going to be what they are,” Sherman said. “Thank goodness our offense executed. But it’s about the process, it’s executing the way you’re supposed to. It’s about doing your job repeatedly, like with robotic consistency.”Arizona (3-5-1) lost its second straight game. Rookie quarterback Kyler Murray threw for 241 yards and two touchdowns.The Cardinals came into the game without their top two running backs, David Johnson and Chase Edmonds, who were battling injuries.Kenyan Drake – who was acquired by the Cardinals on Monday in a trade with the Miami Dolphins – ran for 36 yards on the first play of the game and capped the opening drive with a 4-yard touchdown run. He finished with a team-high 110 yards rushing and 52 yards receiving.“That’s what we expected from him, why we traded for him,” Kingsbury said. “His skill set is perfect for what we do. He’s explosive, he runs tough and to come and learn an entirely new offense, we didn’t hold anything back. We knew we could call our best game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8253f91a5e41ab0447e7d748290afa81765cdda6/0_98_4300_2579/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38884a9c6f7e16d62b1675e790f6a989","title":"james vince guides england to comfortable t20 win over new zealand","story":"England’s five-match Twenty20 series against New Zealand began with a relative stroll in Hagley Park as a typically stylish hand from James Vince helped set up a seven-wicket victory with nine balls to spare.When Eoin Morgan launched his opposite number, Tim Southee, over deep mid-wicket for six, it completed a chase of 154 that rarely felt in doubt after Vince had finessed a 38-ball 59 from No 3. In such a picture-postcard setting, perhaps it was fitting that England’s most aesthetically pleasing batsmen should prove the difference.Morgan, who handed debuts to Pat Brown, Sam Curran and Lewis Gregory and then made 34 from 21 balls, was quick to credit his bowlers after securing a 1-0 lead. Having tipped a belting pitch upon winning the toss, New Zealand’s batsmen were kept largely in check en route to 153 for five.Ross Taylor top-scored with 44 from 35 balls before falling in the final over to give Brown his maiden international wicket on debut, while Daryl Mitchell, son of the England rugby team’s defence coach, John, went on the attack with a quickfire 30.But the total always appeared light as England chipped away at regular intervals, albeit from balls that might otherwise have disappeared beyond the boundary. Chris Jordan’s dismissals of Colin Munro and Tim Seifert both came via full tosses – the latter, for 32, adjudged to be dipping below the waist – while a Rashid half-tracker accounted for Colin de Grandhomme in the deep.Only Curran, opening the bowling with his brother Tom, suffered any serious punishment when his third over was dispatched for 21. But amid figures of one for 33, having persuaded Martin Guptill to chop on amid a sluggish start, it was the outlier on a solid debut for the left-armer.Brown, entrusted with the final over and showing a strong temperament by ensuring Taylor’s late charge was snuffed out, finished with identical numbers to Sam Curran, while the older of the two Surrey siblings was the thriftiest on show by going for just 25 runs from his allocation.Like the hosts, England rather crawled out of the starting blocks. Dawid Malan, preferred to Tom Banton at the top of the order, fell for 11 when trying to take down Mitchell Santner, the first of three victims for the left-arm spinner. But Jonny Bairstow picked things up with 35 from 28 that featured five fours and one six.The Yorkshireman eventually fell in the tenth over to see England 68 for two, holing out off Santner. But by this stage Vince had already begun unfurling an array of glossy fours and a couple of brutal sixes on the way to his maiden international half-century in the format. The end, caught in the deep with 31 still required, may have frustrated him but the damage had been done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5dd25aa7c53e73c4adb6e2a5a5fd5e1064ee22f/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39cd5db6011cc99e3f3015b3684a9977","title":"rugby world cup final watching win england south africa","story":"England and South Africa face off in Yokohama on Saturday.

Patchell finds touch in the right-hand corner. Another good platform for Wales but the line-out is spoiled, there is a knock-on and New Zealand get the put-in at a defensive scrum. Aaron Smith claps excitedly at the decision. This is a good contest and none of these players look to be ‘on the beach’ just yet, so to speak.Wales rewarded for another bright attacking move into All Blacks’ territory. There are several crunching hits by the New Zealand defenders with Gatland’s men knocking on the door again and moving through the phases extremely well. The penalty comes and Patchell strokes over an easy three-pointer. Just four points in it, and Wales looking more than capable of pulling off a famous win if they keep playing like this. Fans may be wondering where the running rugby was against South Africa in the semi-final.23 min: This is breathless, brilliant stuff. Both teams running it from all over the place. A massive looping pass by Patchell finds Welsh numbers waiting on the left wing and All Blacks full-back Barrett, one-on-one with Adams, pulls off an excellent tackle to stop another Welsh score.21 min: New Zealand look very dangerous every time they get the ball in hand. They are enjoying the kind of space that was impossible to find in the semi-final against England last week. But Wales aren’t short of attacking threat themselves and after another All Blacks raid, they they try to run it back from their own 22 through scrum-half Tomos Williams.Sensational score by Hallam Amos. Wales take it through more than 10 phases near the All Blacks’ line. There are some crunching tackles from the All Blacks but Gatland’s men spin the ball left, and instead of using an overlap, Amos dummies and shows Mo’unga a clean pair of heels to sprint over the line. Lovely rugby, and Wales are back in this.16 min: Wales so nearly over for the try! Josh Adams is fed by Williams after an attacking line-out and he superbly bounces and twists out of a couple of tackles and is stopped just a metre short. Then the ball is carried over the try line but it’s held up, and taken back for a penalty to Wales. They kick to the corner and go through some more phases near the New Zealand line.A yard of space is all they need. The All Blacks move into the Welsh 22, Smith collects from a ruck, then sees Barrett running a perceptive diagonal line to the inside. Smith off-loads and Barrett charges through the gap and under the posts. Mo’unga adds the conversion. Brilliantly worked try but perhaps a little soft from a defensive point of view.11 min: The New Zealand scrum is under huge pressure at the first engagement, around halfway. But their No 9 Aaron Smith collects the ball and charges down the left wing ...8 min: Wales now have a bash at the other end. Tomos Williams has a dart on the right, before the ball is moved back left, and James Davies does brilliantly to mop up a loose pass and keep the move going. But the All Blacks eventually repel the danger.The All Blacks’ loose head prop with the first try! They shrug off that early missed penalty by Mo’unga as Retallick collects a good off-load and bursts into the 22 with a lovely step off his left foot. He then sees Moody on his right shoulder and sends him clear with a clinical pass. Moody sprints beyond the cover and es over for the first score. Mo’unga converts. We’ve seen both teams willing to run the ball early on and the signs are good for a memorable match!4 min: New Zealand win a very kickable penalty through their first attack, but Richie Mo’unga misses it from a centre-right position.1 min: New Zealand kick their first possession back to their opponents, and Wales immediately cause them problems, Patchell with a beautiful reverse off-load to Adams, who storms into space on the right behind the defensive line as a big gap opens up. But New Zealand win a penalty at the resulting breakdown and the danger is cleared.Referee Wayne Barnes blows his whistle, and we’re off!A few pre-match thoughts from Don E, in Sydney, on email: “Great to see the stadium full. Two proud rugby nations are going to play their hearts out. I think the NZ nation is hurting more and their team will seek to give them hope.”Before the anthems, a moment of silence for the victims of typhoon Hagibis.Well, this is sweet. A letter to Wales from Tomoko, a Japanese fan who has followed the team around Japan with her two sons since they arrived in Kitakyushu. “Thank you for giving me a dream ... please not be injured.”The teams are walking out on to the pitch, so the anthems and the haka are just moments away ... Don’t forget, you can email me or tweet any thoughts on the match - see above for details!A pre-match chinwag for Hansen and Gatland:A few words from Steve Hansen before kick-off, speaking to ITV:“There’s a focus on wanting to go out and play well. It’s been a tough week, it’s been different…For us we’re excited by this match, they’ve trained well and I’m proud of the lads. My job this week is to make sure we perform.”Sonny Bill Williams is another player set to sign off from All Blacks duty today.“The enigmatic but highly influential talisman, who will almost certainly leave New Zealand rugby after Friday night’s bronze medal match in Tokyo, will depart as he started – iding opinion like no All Black ever has before.”After England’s response to the haka last weekend, will Wales do something different today? Here’s Eleanor Ainge Roy reporting from New Zealand on the response to how England met the challenge last week:Gatland talks to ITV: “It’s not the game we want to be in, but it’s against the All Blacks, so it’s something to get motivated about. The boys have trained well in the last couple of days…it’s a chance for some youngsters to go out there and impress…there’s a lot at stake and we want to go out and give a good performance. Steve Hansen will be a big loss to New Zealand rugby.”Is this a meaningless match? Ex-All Black and ITV pundit Sean Fitzpatrick isn’t having any of that: “It’s easy to have good character when you win all the time. When you don’t win, you’ve got to take it on the chin, you’ve got to pull together. This is a massive game for New Zealand rugby, they need to finish this game on a high.”Gareth Thomas speaking on ITV: “I’ve played in teams that I felt, ‘We’ve beaten New Zealand’. But you switch off for 10 seconds, and you look at the scoreboard, and suddenly you’re behind. If a Welsh team can beat New Zealand in this era it will push us forward, because that psychological barrier will be gone.”Kick-off is coming up in less than 30 minutes.Take some time to read Paul Rees’ preview, in which he mentions that current Japan coach Jamie Joseph is now regarded as in the running to be the next New Zealand coach:Hansen makes seven changes to his semi-final team - and it’s not just the coaches signing off from All Blacks’ rugby today. Captain Kieran Read is also retiring, along with Ben Smith and Ryan Crotty, who both start today. Ardie Savea’s injury gives Shannon Frizell a chance to start at No 6. Injuries have badly hit Gatland’s hopes of Wales’s first win against the All Blacks for 66 years, and he makes nine changes. Hallam Amos is in at full back while the half-backs are Tomos Williams and Rhys Patchell at No 9 and No 10 respectively. Nicky Smith and Dillon Lewis come in to the front row. The ever-inspirational Alun Wyn Jones is captain, in what will surely be his final Rugby World Cup outing.Let’s be honest - neither New Zealand nor Wales wanted to sign off from Japan on these terms, battling for the bronze medal instead of gold. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t here to win. After dispiriting quarter-final defeats last week, motivation may be an issue for some players, but they will also be determined to send off two legendary figures in style. Both New Zealand and Wales say goodbye to long-serving, legendary coaches today. Steve Hansen is signing off after 16 years of involvement on the All Blacks’ coaching staff, having been head coach since 2011. Meanwhile his compatriot (and honorary Welshman) Warren Gatland will bring the curtain down on 12 years coaching Wales.These two teams had very different experiences in the semi-finals: New Zealand were comprehensively outplayed by England while Wales came agonisingly close to sealing a place in tomorrow’s final before a late Handré Pollard ended their dream.With pressure now lifted to a large degree, maybe we will see both teams throw off the shackles today - and throw the ball around like we know they can. It would certainly be a shock to see Wales use the same percentage kicking game employed against Springboks. Let’s just hope rugby is the winner. Regardless of result, both Hansen and Gatland deserve a fitting send-off. Team news coming right up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13761f919c380ef6c350f33de18d26bff70f108e/0_136_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7d19bf5098ae6869490d1e1f1e06aac","title":"ethical guide to ghent belgium vegetarian vegan fair trade","story":"A young and principled population supporting socially aware businesses from food to fashion mean Belgium’s third-largest city is perfect for an eco-friendly breakWhen Lokaal, a cooperatively run vegan cafe specialising in locally sourced produce, opened in 2014 in Ghent’s town centre, it charged just €8 for a main course. To keep prices low, Arno de Mol, the cafe’s owner, ditched costly vegan staples like avocados in favour of doing creative things with local produce such as celeriac, and served the dishes on mismatched crockery from charity shops. Eventually, however, living for his principles took its toll, and with the support of a commercial partner, de Mol increased his prices – although he was disappointed to see that even a €2 rise has made it harder to reach people on lower incomes.De Mol typifies the local, grassroots economy that is expanding in Belgium’s third-largest city. Ghent has long been known for its student population and left-wing politics, but increasingly it is developing a reputation for socially conscious, eco-friendly food and shopping. Part of this is down to the town’s youthful demographic.“Young people are more conscious of the fact that the earth and its resources aren’t as endless as people thought 20 years ago,” says de Mol. He also credits the support of the city council, which has just appointed him to advise on a new online platform, Vanier (van hier means “from here” in Flemish), which encourages restaurants and businesses to buy from local farmers and producers.Lokaal is just one of a number of quality plant-based, socially conscious restaurants in Ghent. Others include vegan cafe Barbiet, all-you-can eat vegan joint Konkommertijd, Cafe de Walrus, a stylised rendering of the traditional Belgian bruin café, and Lekker GEC, a veggie cooperative. At organic food market Beo Versmarkt, customers can sip natural wine as they peruse locally sourced groceries. All aim to foster a gezellig vibe (the Dutch answer to hygge). De Mol’s aim is for Lokaal to feel like “our living room” – and lots of the enterprises are involved in social projects, such as a scheme enabling customers to purchase items for donation to the homeless.“Our parents raised us to think about food and clothes and where they come from,” says Vandamme. “We wanted to sell clothes like in H\u0026ampM but fairly and locally made.” Other shops flying the ethical fashion flag in the city include Mieke and A.puur.a, purveyor of independent sustainable designs and local gender-neutral lingerie designer La Fille d’O, which champions body positivity by using customers of all shapes and sizes as Instagram models.Just Hazel itself specialises in carefully curated European fair fashion brands in affordable, youthful styles. The stock reflects the city’s laid-back sense of style: trend-led but not as high-end or polished as neighbouring city and fashion capital Antwerp. “It’s a combination of second-hand and new,” says Vandamme. Spooren adds: “And it’s got to be easy to wear on a bike.”Like people across Flanders, Ghentians are bike-mad. The streets are stuffed with parked bicycles – often left unlocked. The airy Bidon Coffee \u0026amp Bicycle is arguably the epicentre of the city’s cycling culture, but there’s also Tuub, a quality bike shop with an environmental message, and Plum, a celebrated Flanders institution. The city is home to 44,000 students, and their influence can be seen in the city’s laid-back nightlife, which usually involves new and unsigned bands playing in casual cafe venues. Eric Smout runs popular music promoter Democrazy. Over a high-strength Belgian craft ale in the recently opened Bar Mirwaar, a moodily lit cafe which regularly hosts funk, soul and jazz jam sessions, he tells me that Ghent is a breeding ground for new music talent in Belgium. “Ghent has an artistic feel,” he says. “You have a lot of artists and bands here, lots of free concerts – and you can hop around and see what’s happening.”This is in part thanks to the local music schools, as well as a proliferation of relaxed cafe venues such as Trefpunt and Charlatan, outdoor pop-up Dok, and larger spaces such as former socialist party headquarters-turned art centre Vooruit (whose beautiful, high-ceilinged bar serves an array of craft beers). Outdoor concerts showcasing new talent are a key feature of Gentse Feesten, an annual week-long summer festival (17-26 July 2020). Ghentians joke that babies born nine months later in April are the festival’s children.One influential venue is Zebrastraat, an unusual development that combines private housing with an eclectic contemporary arts programme. Its new bar, Xyz Lounge, has won plaudits for its dramatic design by Parisian “starchitect” Didier Faustino, which features “gender neutral pink” walls with embedded Sonos speakers. Xyz Lounge also hosts regular of events – including outdoor concerts next to a manmade beach in summer, and inside a cosy forest cabin in winter. In unpretentious Ghentian style, it also puts on a weekly bridge club for the elderly.Democrazy is also working on opening a venue of its own to respond to the city’s voracious appetite for live music – from indie rock to techno or contemporary jazz. New bars are popping up all the time, according to Smout. I ask him why there have been so many recent openings and he raises a glass of Bar Mirwaar’s home brew: “The combination of beer and music – it’s very good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/267e1e3d72d96f3bc8a4c2cdee574c5ed5f86606/101_76_4743_2846/master/4743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a5a5c482b921bd7ab739612d219cf29","title":"the morning show review jennifer aniston","story":"Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carrell match the Friends star stride for stride in this funny, fearless drama from Apple TV+What a strange and rather lovely thing it is to watch an actor you have grown up with for two and a half decades finally come into her kingdom. So it is with Jennifer Aniston who, 25 years after she arrived on our screens in Friends, returns in a TV series for the first time since the hit show ended in 2004.The Morning Show is a slick, sophisticated venture stuffed with powerhouse performances – Aniston’s foremost among them. She plays Alex Levy, the co-anchor of a morning talk show whose life is thrown into disarray when her co-presenter Mitch (Steve Carrell, proving alongside Aniston that if you can do comedy you can do anything) is accused of sexual misconduct and fired. Their chemistry kept the waning show afloat – without it, she becomes even more vulnerable. Behind the scenes, network executives have already been looking to replace her ageing presence. This is their opportunity to do so, at least until Alex starts to fight furiously back while the lies, rumours, deals, double-crossings and backstabbings multiply. In a coup d’etat, she installs as her new partner a scrappy regional reporter, Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon), who is experiencing 15 minutes of fame as a voice of the people after candid footage of her at a coal-mining protest went viral.Inevitably, there are echoes of Network and Broadcast News in the setting, and in the grappling with the porous borders between news and entertainment, fact and fiction, opinion and propaganda. But everything is rendered fresh and new by the reckoning with the #MeToo era.It has clearly galvanised everyone involved with the show. The initial development began before the New York Times published its first article about what would become proliferating allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Those first months of work were rapidly scrapped and the concept retooled to respond to an emerging and very different environment. And it has a correspondingly urgent feel, a sense of scripts forged in a white heat, the odd clunky moment more than compensated for by the show’s infectious vitality. Every episode has at least one magisterial two-hander – perhaps the best of them pairing Mitch with a similarly ostracised and baffled “good guy”, played by the great Martin Short – that manages to distil a thousand feelings and twist a thousand thoughts into a single scene.As the first foray by new streaming service Apple TV+, it is all the more impressive that there isn’t a weak link in The Morning Show. Aniston is flawless – wholly convincing as a woman both broken by and rightfully raging at Mitch’s betrayal, a force to be reckoned with and a person who has had it up to here with a lifetime of negotiating other people’s whims, needs and prejudices. Everyone else – especially Billy Crudup as the network suit playing seven-dimensional chess with everyone – matches her point for point. The script has depth and endless torque and the whole thing is an exhilarating rush that makes room for nuance, thought and – though it’s definitely a drama – humour. Like ageing anchors and not-good guys, established streaming services will no doubt be looking over their shoulders now, and worrying a little more every day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a3f0f09c106690d782618143f6b576ac0caa93c/0_116_4851_2911/master/4851.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecf104e3cd6d902fada109bdc6d26946","title":"new york city bike lanes car culture","story":"City council passed legislation to invest $1.7bn in road infrastructure over 10 years in move to improve safety New York is set to build more than 250 new bike lanes and add 1m sq ft of pedestrian space in a landmark move designed to “break the car culture” of the city.The city council passed legislation this week that will see $1.7bn invested in road infrastructure over 10 years in a move that it is hoped will transform city streets and dramatically improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians.The New York city council speaker, Corey Johnson, who introduced the “streets master plan” bill and is anticipated to run for mayor in 2021, said after the vote: “The way we plan our streets now makes no sense and New Yorkers pay the price every day, stuck on slow buses or risking their own safety cycling without protected bike lanes … I want to completely revolutionise how we share our street space, and that’s what this bill does.“This is a roadmap to breaking the car culture in a thoughtful, comprehensive way, and I am so proud to pass this bill today.”The new law requires the city to release and carry out a “master plan” every five years that prioritises street safety, public transport use, cutting vehicle emissions and access for people with disabilities.The first plan, due in December 2021, will include 150 miles of bus lanes protected either physically or by camera and 250 miles of protected bike lanes – meaning they are physically separated from traffic – over five years, improved bus stops and passenger information and changes to traffic lights to speed up buses. Within the first two years, the plan pledges to create more than 1m sq ft of pedestrian space.The second, due in 2026, will commit to a full, connected cycle lane network, protected bus lanes on all viable routes and accessible pedestrian signals at 2,500 intersections in five years.While New York has some way to go before it can compete with cycle-friendly leaders such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, the new law marks a significant moment for the city, which has prioritised cars since the 1920s.Marco te Brömmelstroet, professor in urban mobility futures at the University of Amsterdam and academic director of Urban Cycling Institute, said the change in approach represents a “radical shift in the logic that underlies choices in the design of street infrastructure”.He added: “Where there is a century-long tradition in the US, and in much of the world that followed examples from the US, that puts the speed and efficient flow of vehicles central, and that made travel times the undisputed central goal of infrastructure planning, this new law seems to make this secondary to choices that put justice central.”He said New York has the potential to set an “inspiring example” to other US cities if it can show that the law not only functions but also has a positive impact on other aspects of society.Nearly 800,000 New Yorkers cycle regularly, according to city statistics. It is estimated that more than 490,000 bicycle trips are made every day in the city – three times more than the number made 15 years ago.As of last year, there were a total of 1,240 miles of bike lanes in the city – 480 of which were protected.Meanwhile, use of Citi Bike, New York’s on-street cycle hire scheme, is on the rise. Close to 2.5m trips were made in September, with an average of 80,475 a day. In comparison, September 2018 saw nearly 1.9m trips and an average of 62,616 trips a day.But safety remains an issue for many riders and potential cyclists amid increased congestion on roads – in part because of services such as Uber and Lyft – and a crisis on the subway.Jon Orcutt, a spokesman for Bike New York, said the new measures, especially protected bike lanes, will save lives and encourage more people to cycle.“The traffic in the rest of the street is so heavy that if you want to really build cycling into an option for people, other than the small number of courageous souls who are willing to throw elbows with taxis and trucks, you have to give people separation from the vehicles.”During the evening commute on the Williamsburg stretch of the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway, a popular cycle lane, both cyclists and drivers said they were in favour of more protected cycle lanes.Alex Price, 24, who works in emergency construction and lives in Brooklyn, said: “It’s always this game of should I get on the pavement or should I stay on the street? It really depends how busy the traffic is, both cars and pedestrians, so yeah, just having a cycle lane makes things easier.”Grace Dulik, 27, recently started using Citi Bike to and from her home and work at a natural food company in Brooklyn, but is afraid to take routes that do not have cycle lanes. “I have multiple people in my network of friends who have been killed by hit-and-run by drivers, so it definitely seems to be a big issue … it seems like you can do everything right as a biker and still get hit by a car,” she said.Waiting to collect a passenger nearby, taxi driver Andre Locke, 20, from Queens, said he supports protected cycle lanes. “I say make it so that if someone wants to ride their bike in the street that they stay in the bike lane … If they do that, there’ll be less people getting hit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0f9d7349369607cf9584c256ed7afcac8caffee/284_617_3128_1877/master/3128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebb6bdb14350d46d575a734309c99564","title":"emails about russia 2018 world cup bid being offered online","story":"Anonymous Telegram account indicates emails for sale after reports emerge of dossier on how to bribe Fifa officialsAn anonymously run Telegram account has indicated that it wants to sell a tranche of emails relating to Russia’s 2018 World Cup bid, after reports that they contain a dossier compiled by Russian officials on how to bribe Fifa executive council members.The existence of the emails was first reported by the investigative website the Insider. According to the Insider, an aide to the former footballer Franz Beckenbauer promised to deliver his vote in exchange for “generous compensation for his consulting services”, later specified as at least €3m.A Cypriot Fifa executive’s vote could be bought for €1.5m, and the former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner would vote for “whoever offers him the most”, the Insider report says.There is no suggestion that the Russian officials acted on the dossier, nor of any wrongdoing by those named. Thompson, who was at the time the head of England’s rival World Cup bid, has denied his wife was offered any gifts.Warner has been banned for life by Fifa’s ethics committee, and Sepp Blatter and the former France captain Michel Platini, who are both profiled in the dossier, each received an eight-year ban from football in 2011.The emails purportedly come from the account of Sergei Kapkov, a Russian politician and former head of the country’s national football academy, and are in the possession of an anonymously run Telegram channel called BlackMirror.In an email exchange, BlackMirror told the  that it released the “samples” in order to stimulate interest from potential “acquirers”.The email containing the dossier was allegedly sent in March 2010 by Alexander Djordjadze, the head of the Russia 2018 organising committee, nine months before Fifa’s executive council delivered the 2018 tournament to Russia in a secret ballot. According to the Insider, it was sent to Igor Shuvalov, then a deputy prime minister under Vladimir Putin, Arkady Dvorkovich, an aide to the then-president Dmitry Medvedev, and Kapkov, who later became the head of Moscow’s culture department.Fifa opened an investigation in 2014, but ultimately decided there was not enough evidence of bribery to re-run the vote. Fifa’s head judge in the inquest noted that it had limited access to potential evidence and that the computers used by the Russian bid team had been destroyed after the vote.The emails were purportedly stolen from Kapkov, who left the government in 2015. Screenshots of the emails were released on the BlackMirror Telegram channel.Reached by the , the person or people behind the account avoided saying directly that they were selling the emails for money, writing instead that they would discuss “conditions” to “transfer” the archive with “potential acquirers.” BlackMirror said it didn’t have any personal reaction to the information revealed in the emails.BlackMirror did not immediately say what price it wanted for the emails, but prices for similar archives can cost tens of thousands of pounds. In 2016, the hacking group Anonymous International reportedly requested 100 bitcoin, then about £43,000, for emails purportedly from Kapkov’s account. It is unclear whether the two sets of emails are connected, although BlackMirror said it has emails dated up to 2019, indicating more recent access to Kapkov’s account.Asked how it had come into possession of the emails, BlackMirror said: “We don’t discuss technical questions.”BlackMirror said it was already considering another “release” of files, likely not related to Russia’s World Cup bid.The Insider said it had received originals from BlackMirror of the files allegedly shared between Kapkov and powerful Russian officials.Besides the dossier, they include strategy documents for a wide-reaching influence campaign among the 2018 World Cup organising committee and even large sponsors of the sporting organisation.Alexei Sorokin, the head of Russia’s 2018 bid team, told the RBC news outlet that the documents were fake and that there was never any dossier of Fifa executive committee members.“It’s nonsense,” he said, adding that Kapkov took no part in the bid process. “It seems to me that the whole thing was fabricated from beginning to end.”He also noted that Russia had answered questions during an “official investigation” into the vote and said that “all of our ‘influence’ came during open contacts”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b06a03734c54444de356f21ad5b8ddc03f38549e/0_149_5256_3154/master/5256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3423afe9df8da13731208b3c10ed219e","title":"friday briefing unregistered voters urged to get on roll","story":"Deadline is 26 November … GCHQ lifts lid on wartime spying hubs … and now Donald Trump really does live on the golf courseHello, Warren Murray helping you maintain a diet rich in news.There has been a surge in young people registering to vote, with almost a third of the 316,264 registrations submitted in the last two days from people aged under 25, according to government figures. However, 9.4 million people are still missing from the electoral roll, says the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), and large disproportions remain between different social and economic groups who register. The final date to enrol to vote is 26 November. “We cannot be complacent – this election must see the biggest registration drive this country has seen to ensure it genuinely represents all of us,” said Willie Sullivan, ERS senior director.

It is generally considered a breach of protocol for world leaders to pick a side in foreign elections. Corbyn accused Trump of “trying to interfere in Britain’s election to get his friend Boris Johnson elected” so that American companies can get their hands on the NHS. Unhelpfully for Johnson, Trump said the US “can’t make a trade deal with the UK” under “certain aspects” of Boris Johnson’s stalled Brexit deal with the EU – leaving No 10 scurrying to insist that “we can strike our own free trade deals” under the deal. The PM faced a frosty reception at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge where he visited unannounced with national media not invited to attend.

At another site, Marston Montgomery, Pamela Pigeon, a New Zealander, became in 1943 the agency’s first female commander, overseeing about 100 people who worked fingerprinting inidual German radios – taking advantage of the fact, explains the GCHQ historian Tony Comer, that each crystal at the heart of a radio oscillated slightly differently. “It presented an easy way to distinguish between a bomber squadron or simply fighter aircraft.” Ivy Farm, in Knockholt in Kent, was the first place to intercept a fax: a diagram showing a typical US bomber formation, being sent from Berlin to Japan.

A\u0026ampE units are likely to end up treating those injured on bonfire night next Tuesday because fireworks have been misused or exploded near people. “Hand surgeons see devastating injuries caused by fireworks throughout the winter months, with people often losing large portions of their hand,” said David Newington, president of the British Society for Surgery of the Hand (BSSH).

De Niro is pithy: “It’s different, but I like it just as much.” Pacino goes long: “It sort of depends on what you’re doing,” he says. “I hate to say it, but you can go 20 years between inspirations.” He stops for a moment, baffled by his own eloquence. “Bear with me – I’m going through the bushes here and I’ll come out with something.” He says he is always on the lookout “to find something that you really connect to, you really want to do”.De Niro nods along furiously. Pacino is in the groove. “Sometimes I feel I know nothing about acting. Until you start. That’s what’s exciting for me. A new character.

Warren Gatland and Steve Hansen, the Wales and New Zealand coaches, are both taking their final bows in Friday’s bronze medal match and are expected to play with the safety valve off.Max Verstappen has hit back at Lewis Hamilton, calling the British world champion disrespectful for comments he made after winning the Mexican Grand Prix. Arsenal produced a superb exhibition of attacking football to beat Slavia Prague 8-0 and move into the Champions League quarter-finals 13-2 on aggregate. And a thrilling climax may have made up for the dreary start, but this year’s World Series offered no refuge from the broader problems facing baseball at the dawn of a new decade.Donald Trump’s interview with Nigel Farage in which the president weighed in on the election is the lead on the : “Trump urges Farage to do a deal with Johnson”, the Times: “Trump tells Johnson to join forces with Farage”, the Express: “Trump: PM and Farage need to strike pact” and the Mail: “Trump tells Farage: do deal with Boris”.In other political news, the i reports: “Corbyn vows to transform UK by tackling wealthy elite”, while the Mirror has: “Bercow: I want £1m to be in I’m a Celebrity” with the paper running a story that talks between the former Speaker and ITV broke down over his pay demands.The FT says: “Trump impeachment hearing to be held in open after key vote”, the  has a story about human rights lawyers seeking compensation from British American Tobacco for child labourers and their families: “BAT faces landmark legal case over Malawian families’ poverty wages” and the Sun continues to report on Jeremy Kyle: “Kyle bile even more vile”.

That’s why they use nonsense to pull the wool over people’s eyes,” replies Magda Rostocka, whose profile tells her almost 4,400 followers she is “left-handed with her heart on the right”.In reality, neither woman existed. Both accounts were run by the paid employees of a small marketing company based in the city of Wrocław in southwest Poland.But what the employee pretending to be Magda Rostocka did not know is that the colleague pretending to be Girl from Żoliborz was an undercover reporter who had infiltrated the company, giving rare insight into the means by which fake social media accounts are being used by private firms to influence unsuspecting voters and consumers.Social media companies are coming under increasing pressure over fake accounts. Facebook has said it disabled 2.2bn fake accounts in the first three months of 2019, but the European Commission this week said there was a “disconnect” between such claims.The undercover reporter, Katarzyna Pruszkiewicz, spent six months this year working at Cat@Net, which describes itself as an “ePR agency comprising specialists who build a positive image of companies, private iniduals and public institutions – mostly in social media.”.A member of the Reporters’ Foundation, a consortium of Polish investigative journalists, Pruszkiewicz’s first task when she joined the company was to set up a social media avatar for sharing “social and political content” with the aim of attracting 500 followers.After a trial period, she was given access to the company’s internal communications channels, through which the company’s employees, each of whom ran a dozen or so social media accounts, would receive guidance and instructions from their managers – what issues to engage with, who to promote, and who to denigrate.The accounts produced both leftwing and rightwing content, attracting attention, credibility and support from other social media users, who could then be rallied in support of the company’s clients.“The aim is to build credibility with people from both sides of the political ide. Once you have won someone’s trust by reflecting their own views back at them, you are in a position to influence them,” said Wojciech Cieśla, who oversaw the investigation in collaboration with Investigate Europe, a consortium of European investigative reporters.“Reading these communications, you can see how the leftwing and rightwing accounts would receive their daily instructions, how they would be marshalled and directed like two flanks of the same army on a battlefield.”A majority of Cat@Net’s employees are understood to be disabled, allowing the company to derive substantial public subsidies from Poland’s National Disabled Rehabilitation Fund. According to the Reporters Foundation, the company has received about 1.5 million zloty (£300,000) from the fund since November 2015.“Many of them are really good people – they are compassionate, they do charity work and engage in social activism in their spare time, but their disabilities mean that their employment opportunities are limited,” Pruszkiewicz told the . “For them it was just work and that’s it.”One of Pruszkiewicz’s responsibilities was to operate anonymous accounts with instructions to promote content produced by TVP, Poland’s state broadcaster, which is widely reviled by critics for its extreme partisanship and hate speech directed against minority groups.‘It would be great if you posted positive comments about the government’s subsidy for TVP and the television licence fee,’ read an email from her manager.An internal report seen by the  details how the fake accounts were used to denigrate legitimate criticism of the broadcaster. According to an analysis by ISD Global, a London-based thinktank that studies global trends in extremism and polarisation, Cat@Net accounts created up to 10,000 posts in defence of TVP, with a potential reach of 15 million views.Another beneficiary of Cat@Net’s influence operations was a recently elected member of the Polish parliament for the leftwing Democratic Left Alliance party. Cat@Net’s leftwing accounts promoted the politician’s candidacy to the European Parliament in elections held in May this year, with at least 90 different accounts circulating and responding to his social media posts. The company’s rightwing accounts would then oppose the leftwing accounts, generating conflict and traffic, thereby drawing attention to the candidate.Accounts were created that would concentrate on the aviation and defence industries, and target key decision-makers involved in the awarding of major government defence contracts.The accounts were used to undermine public support for the Polish government’s decision to place a major order with the American contractor Lockheed Martin for the F-35 fighter jet, promoting instead the Eurofighter Typhoon produced by a consortium that includes Airbus, BAE Systems, and Leonardo – which has a Polish subsidiary, PZL Świdnik. Cat@Net employees were reminded by their managers that “the F-35 is our enemy number one” but “don’t be too pushy with the Eurofighter, otherwise they will know they are being trolled”.It is unclear whether the organisations and iniduals on whose behalf the fake accounts were lobbying were aware of Cat@Net’s practices. Internal documents suggest the company received most if not all of its commissions from an external PR company, which may have been outsourcing the influence operations without its clients’ knowledge.PZL Świdnik said it “conducts its business activities in an ethical manner in all respects” and any supplier of services to it is required to comply with its code of ethics. It denied engaging in any wrongdoing regarding communications practices relating to disinformation, hate speech, or attempts to influence political decisions.“The big question is how regulators everywhere are going to respond to the challenge posed by this kind of activity,” said Peter Pomerantsev, a London-based expert on disinformation and author of This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality.“They might argue that none of the content that was shared was illegal – it wasn’t hate speech, it wasn’t inciting violence, it wasn’t war propaganda. But what it exposes is just how flimsy and ineffective our regulatory framework is, and how vulnerable we are to more dangerous actors using similar techniques.”In a statement posted to its website, Cat@Net strongly denied it was a “troll farm”: “The company’s field of activity is the outsourcing of marketing operations to social media. We communicate accurate information, speak for our clients, and promote their products and services like any other agency of its kind.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

The staff of around 60 German linguists, mainly young women, were employed to live log the communications.This type of interception had never been done before for voice communications and the tactical nature of the information collected by the young women helped to protect British pilots and sailors.Tony Comer, GCHQ’s historian, told the  that the role needed people who had a good ear, could rapidly interpret and understand what was happening. They needed to “get the information out in as near real-time as possible,” he said, describing them as the “live bloggers” of their day. Abbots Cliff House is available online for nearly £2,000 a nightThe property’s current owner has already become acquainted with its rich history after being visited by several women who were stationed there for RAF decoding work during the war.Stephen Lucas, 58, claimed a bricked-up room in the basement was also reputed to hide abandoned surveillance equipment.Recalling his recent visit from the RAF decoders, He said: “They told us some stories about Churchill visiting the property - they weren’t allowed to salute him or anything - everyone was in civvies and the house was camouflaged, it was wonderful.”He added: “A lot of guests are really interested in it.”The covert past of the site has been revealed along with four others to mark the 100th anniversary of GCHQ.Director Jeremy Fleming said the past century has seen GCHQ “save countless lives, given Britain an edge, and solve and harness some of the world’s most complex technological challenges”.At the outbreak of war the Government Code and Cypher School, GCHQ’s original name, had 200 staff working at Bletchley Park and Mansfield College in Oxford.By December 1944 there were 10,000 people working at Bletchley Park and another 20,000 in outstations throughout the UK.General election latest news: Conservatives reject Donald Trump’s calls to ‘get together’ with the Brexit PartyComment: It\u0026#39s not just Samira Ahmed: the BBC treats all its \u0026#39talent\u0026#39 appallinglyFriday morning news briefing: Donald Trump calls for Johnson-Farage dealComment: Boris Johnson will only \u0026#39get Brexit done\u0026#39 by winning back the lost Tory generation\tEmma Weymouth\u0026#39s Strictly Diary: \u0026#39I hope the scary Samba doesn’t scupper me now\u0026#39Prince Harry sends English squad a pic of son Archie in a Red Rose Jersey ahead of World Cup showdownPrince Charles to visit the Scottish Borders for environmental charityLegal loophole allowing drivers to film on phones to be closedOne dead, 15 injured after double bus crash in Orpington Unhealthy lifestyles fuel a 50 per cent rise in UK deaths from liver cancer Government to close loophole that lets drivers use phones behind wheelSaatchi Gallery criticised for creating \u0026#39Britain\u0026#39s most expensive exhibition ticket\u0026#39 for Tutankhamun showFace recognition should only be used by police to target serious crime, says information commissionerOver a million students face disruption as academics from 56 universities sign up to strike over pay and pensionsBrexit Party standing in 100 seats could help Tories by draining support from Labour Leave votersThree top female presenters have tackled BBC over gender pay gap, Samira Ahmed case told The Accident, episode 2, review: \u0026#39A devastating fight for justice\u0026#39Revealed: Postal workers\u0026#39 secret plot to destroy the election by going on strike weeks before the voteComment: Do the Conservatives have any real answer to Labour’s digital dirty war?First arrest and prosecution for praying in public case collapses after bungled police investigationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000214394992_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhJ9OF22R61zNdPttfFPBIKsXVjD1YkuhNUMuJ1fa8FM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"not just samira ahmed bbc treats talent appallingly","story":"Samira Ahmed has taken the BBC to an employment tribunalMessage to Samira Ahmed: it’s not because you’re a woman.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 640 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2140 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3340 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3840 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4040 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 640 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey.

This is actually a great result for us.” Two years later, the BBC reviewed Vine’s contract and Leatham reflected on what a “torturous” process it had been.Armitage told The Independent: The email says it all.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises.

Money editor Jenny Ross said: “This is a positive step that may help to plug the gaps created by the alarming rate of bank branch and cashpoint closures across the UK – so Link must deal with requests swiftly and aim to provide free machines for all those left cut off from cash.“But it\u0027s clear this scheme alone won\u0027t fix the country\u0027s broken cash landscape.“Appalling mismanagement by the industry and regulators has left the cash system on the brink of collapse and communities are being presented with a confusing array of schemes claiming to fix the problem.“That\u0027s why the government must intervene to protect cash for as long as it is needed.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Money editor Jenny Ross said: “This is a positive step that may help to plug the gaps created by the alarming rate of bank branch and cashpoint closures across the UK – so Link must deal with requests swiftly and aim to provide free machines for all those left cut off from cash.“But it\u0027s clear this scheme alone won\u0027t fix the country\u0027s broken cash landscape.“Appalling mismanagement by the industry and regulators has left the cash system on the brink of collapse and communities are being presented with a confusing array of schemes claiming to fix the problem.“That\u0027s why the government must intervene to protect cash for as long as it is needed.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If they choose to ignore this message from their staff then strike action looks inevitable.”The union said it balloted more than 52,000 USS members in 69 universities for strike action and overall turnout was 53 per cent.A spokesperson for Universities UK, which represents university employers, said: “Employers remain open to further talks with UCU to discuss how the dispute can be resolved without industrial action, which would be damaging for staff and students.\u0026nbspRecent negotiations between UCU and Universities UK concluded with no cuts to USS pension benefits, and employers paying the majority of the extra contributions required under pensions law.“In a challenging economic environment, this outcome is the best that could be achieved. Crucially, it is acceptable to both the USS Trustee and The Pensions Regulator.”The union’s higher education committee will meet on Friday to consider the next steps.University and College Union\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field.”The move follows a warning from the European Commission that there was “evidence of coordinated inauthentic behaviour aimed at spreading isive material on online platforms”, and that “malign actors constantly change their strategies”.Created with Sketch.Facebook birthday: 15 defining moments for the social network Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called \u0027TheFacebook\u0027 from his dorm.

Despite its initial success, Google+ ultimately failed and will be shut down completely in 2019On 18 May, 2012, Facebook went public. The initial public offering raised $16 billion – the third largest in US history915 Gobbling up the competitionFacebook acquired Instagram in April 2012 for $1 billion, consolidating its position as the world\u0027s leading social networkOn 4 October, 2012, Zuckerberg announced that Facebook had hit 1 billion users. \u0027If you’re reading this: thank you for giving me and my little team the honour of serving you,\u0027 he wrote in a blog post1115 Expanding its empireIn February 2014 Facebook acquired the messaging app WhatsApp for $19.3 billionIn June 2017, Facebook passed the 2 billion user milestoneOn 17 March 2018, news broke that UK firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from around 87 million Facebook users for the purpose of political profiling in the build up to the 2016 US presidential electionsDespite the scandals and subsequent #DeleteFacebook campaign, Facebook posted record profits just before its 15th anniversary, the equivalent of $7.37 from each of its 2.32 billions usersA study found that people are happier when they don’t use Facebook, adding to mounting evidence surrounding the impact social media has on mental healthTwitter was widely\u0026nbsppraised for taking a stance against misinformation and voter manipulation, though many have pointed out that political adverts are far more prevalent on Facebook.The social media giant did not respond to a request for comment on whether it also plans a similar ban, but has consistently claimed it is tackling the issue in a different way through a combination of human review and AI-based technology to root out malicious or misleading political ads.Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg stood by the policy during an earnings call on Wednesday, claiming that “ads on Facebook are already more transparent than anywhere else”.He added: “I don’t think it’s right for private companies to censor politician and the news.”Yuval Ben-Itzhak, head of the social media marketing firm Socialbakers, warns that the issue is not a technical challenge for Facebook, but an ethical one.“Facebook operates at a different scale to Twitter and has many more resources. Banning political ads on digital channels does feel like taking a step back to traditional media, so limiting the targeting of political ads seems like a better option for Facebook,” he told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“The question Facebook is asking is how far should businesses like Facebook be able to censor opinions and news?”Mark Zuckerberg’s secret plan to crush TikTokOne of those calling for Facebook to be more open and transparent about the spread of disinformation across the social network is the Open Knowledge Foundation, a non-profit organisation that promotes the sharing of free information.“Twitter’s decision is very welcome and sends a strong signal to other social media giants. It will go a considerable way to preventing the spread of disinformation and ‘fake news’,” said Catherine Stihler, chief executive of the Open Knowledge Foundation.However, she warned that more needs to be done to prevent disinformation campaigns from blighting the December’s election, forthcoming elections across Europe, and next year’s US Presidential election.“Facebook must act on the growing demands for greater transparency,” Ms Stihler added. “Social media giants must work to build a fair, free and open digital world.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped.

It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.Fans have been waiting for the next volume ever since.

I don’t know why. I think it’s because it’s always related to women.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“They never say feisty man, kid maybe, but I find it slightly insulting, I don’t know why.

There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 446 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 646 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 746 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s.

Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1546 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1846 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2146 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2346 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272646 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3746 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3846 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3946 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.Arriving in the wake of Marvel’s Black Panther, the film highlights the links between the saga of the real-life Agoji women, who fought in the former Kingdom of Dahomey (located in modern-day Benin), and the all-women comic-book world protectors known as Dora Milaje.The writer Jack Thorne says his latest four-part drama, which explores the aftermath of a disaster on a small community, was shaped by the Grenfell Tower fire. Rather than overcrowded west London, his takes place in Glyngolau, a fictional run-down town in Wales. A new building project, The Light, is being built on the outskirts. It’s unclear what The Light is, exactly, which is deliberate. The point is not what it is, exactly, but what it represents: 1,000 new jobs and a rare moment of economic optimism for families who have forgotten what hope feels like.Watching Seven Worlds, One Planet, it’s hard to know what to worry about most: the future of wildlife – catastrophically imperilled by our fondness for fossil fuels, long-haul travel and convenience food – or Attenborough himself, now 93 and one of the few people that the world will listen to about the impending apocalypse. Like the species on whose behalf he speaks, his continued existence is vital for us all.Hailee Steinfeld is perfectly cast. She has a face – and a set of elastic expressions – that feels both well-suited to a period piece (as first displayed in her Oscar-nominated role in True Grit in 2010), and resolutely out of place in it. Just as Emily Dickinson was. Steinfeld crackles with charm and impropriety.Click through to see the best TV shows of 2019 (so far) “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 346 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272646 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3746 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3846 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3946 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.Arriving in the wake of Marvel’s Black Panther, the film highlights the links between the saga of the real-life Agoji women, who fought in the former Kingdom of Dahomey (located in modern-day Benin), and the all-women comic-book world protectors known as Dora Milaje.The writer Jack Thorne says his latest four-part drama, which explores the aftermath of a disaster on a small community, was shaped by the Grenfell Tower fire. Rather than overcrowded west London, his takes place in Glyngolau, a fictional run-down town in Wales. A new building project, The Light, is being built on the outskirts. It’s unclear what The Light is, exactly, which is deliberate. The point is not what it is, exactly, but what it represents: 1,000 new jobs and a rare moment of economic optimism for families who have forgotten what hope feels like.Watching Seven Worlds, One Planet, it’s hard to know what to worry about most: the future of wildlife – catastrophically imperilled by our fondness for fossil fuels, long-haul travel and convenience food – or Attenborough himself, now 93 and one of the few people that the world will listen to about the impending apocalypse. Like the species on whose behalf he speaks, his continued existence is vital for us all.Hailee Steinfeld is perfectly cast. She has a face – and a set of elastic expressions – that feels both well-suited to a period piece (as first displayed in her Oscar-nominated role in True Grit in 2010), and resolutely out of place in it. Just as Emily Dickinson was. Steinfeld crackles with charm and impropriety.The actor made similar comments in an interview with The Times in 2015, in which she\u0026nbspdenounced the use of the word “sassy” for women.Mirren was on the programme to discuss her forthcoming role\u0026nbspin the film The Good Liar, which she stars in alongside Ian McKellen.Catherine the Great\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is the latest in a string of outages for the social media platform, coming just months after one of the biggest down times in the app\u0027s history.Facebook Messenger also stopped working for many users, though WhatsApp\u0026nbspdid not appear to suffer any issues.A spokesperson for Instagram was not immediately available for comment.The most affected regions appear to be the UK and US, according to the website Down Detector, though problems were experienced in Asia, South America and across Europe.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child.

It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  Stuber indicated that subscribers might see more transparency in the future, though he didn’t disclose specifics.“We do it in some of our earnings reports, and we are going to be doing it more and more because that filmmaker and that actor and that actress want to know that their movie got out there globally in a big way,” he added.Netflix periodically releases viewership figures, such as when it said on 8 July\u0026nbspthat the third season of\u0026nbspStranger Things\u0026nbsphad been watched by\u0026nbsp40.7m\u0026nbsphousehold accounts since its premiere on 4 July.This would mark the biggest four-day debut for any film or series on the platform.Nielsen, a measurement firm that supplies TV ratings, mostly reflected those findings,\u0026nbspVulture\u0026nbspreported at the time.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even one of the small number of ecclesiastical objects in the hoard appears to have been of a potentially military character.The hoard was made up of golden fittings from up to 150 swords, gold and garnet elements of a very high status seax (fighting knife), a spectacular gilded silver helmet, an impressive 30cm-long golden cross, a beautiful gold and garnet pectoral cross,\u0026nbspa probable bishop’s headdress – and parts of what is likely to have been a portable battlefield shrine or reliquary.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe extraordinarily ornate bishop’s headdress is the world’s earliest surviving example of high status ecclesiastical headgear.Dating from the mid-seventh century AD, its presence in an otherwise predominantly military hoard suggests that its ecclesiastical owner may well have been performing a supporting role on a battlefield.\u0026nbspSignificantly, the headdress bears no resemblance to later medieval or modern bishops’ mitres – and is therefore likely to trigger debate among historians as to its stylistic origins because it looks so\u0026nbspsimilar in basic design to headdresses believed by early medieval clerics to have been worn by biblical Jewish high priests and also resembles headdresses worn by pagan Roman priests.The discovery may therefore prompt scholarly speculation that the style of headwear worn by senior Christian priests in the early medieval period could have been at least partly inspired by perceived biblical precedent\u0026nbsp– or may even have been inherited from the\u0026nbsppagan Roman past.The headdress – made of beautifully crafted gold, inlaid with garnets and white and dark red glass – dates from the period when Christianity was being re-established across many of the local kingdoms that would eventually become England.It represents the status and prestige of the\u0026nbspChurch – but, significantly, it is decorated with\u0026nbsptypical pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon semi-abstract animal designs as well as seven Christian crosses.If indeed the archaeologists are right in believing it to be potentially an early-to-mid-seventh century bishop’s headdress, it would have been worn, perhaps during royal or other\u0026nbspceremonial events, by the first or second generation of clergy involved in the re-Christianisation of what is now England.The portable shrine – potentially presided over by the owner of the headdress or a similar senior cleric – was probably designed to be carried into battle on two horizontal poles (like a litter or later sedan chair) – in order to obtain God’s help in securing military victory.Only seven elements of the shrine, all made of gold, have survived.One element (probably part of a cross) bears a highly significant inscription – a quotation from the Book of Numbers. It reads “Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before thee”.Its biblical context is that of Moses uttering these words alongside the Ark of the Covenant accompanying the Israelites in their journey across the wilderness, threatened by hostile tribes. The nature of the inscription suggests that the precious shrine or reliquary (in Latin,\u0026nbsparca) had probably been used as a war talisman in the long and bitter conflicts between warring kingdoms in early Anglo-Saxon England.The ecclesiastical treasures and secularmilitary items appear to have been treated in a potentially disrespectful way before they were buried. They had been broken andor folded and deliberately bent out of shape.\u0026nbspBack in the mid-seventh century, southeast Staffordshire (the area near Lichfield where the material was found) was controlled by a powerful pagan Anglo-Saxon king called Penda.His geopolitical and military activity formed a major part of the bloodsoaked rivalry and conflict between his own kingdom (Mercia) and other, often Christian, kingdoms in other parts of England – especially in Northumbria and East Anglia.Given the probable mid-seventh century date of the burial of the treasure, it is therefore possible that it was war booty captured by the pagan Mercian king, Penda, from armies led by Christians, such as the East Anglians.\u0026nbspOne possible explanation is that the treasure was ritually buried as a Mercian pagan war trophy – perhaps even as a thanks offering to a pagan deity for delivering victory.Putting Christian material into the ground in such a way may have been seen by Penda (or an equivalent figure) as a spiritual or ideological victory over Christianity to mirror a military one.\u0026nbspThe 10-year investigation into the hoard has involved detailed scientific examination of the metalwork, exhaustive art historical assessment of the stylistic and iconographic aspects of the artefacts and research into the potential historical contexts of its burial.However, now that the material has been fully published, there is likely to be an ongoing debate as to the most likely historical narrative or narratives that led to so much gold and silver being buried almost 1,400 years ago in a field in Staffordshire.Scholars would love to know who originally owned the bishop’s headdress, the portable battlefield shrine and the golden helmet. But sadly the reality is that it may never be possible to definitively solve those particular mysteries.However, there are potential candidates for the sort of iniduals who may have been their original owners.At around the time that the headdress was made, East Anglia was being Christianised, by the area’s first bishop a French cleric called Felix. It is therefore conceivable that the headdress was commissioned by him.His successor as bishop was a man called Thomas, an East Anglian of possible Celtic British origin, and he would certainly be a candidate for the inidual the Mercians actually captured the headdress from – because he died, potentially in battle, around the time that the East Anglian kingdom was defeated by Mercia.\u0026nbspThe gilt silver helmet almost certainly belonged to an Anglo-Saxon royal figure.Staffordshire Hoard to stay in Britain for good“It potentially adorned the head of a king of East Anglia,” said one of the Staffordshire hoard book authors, archaeologist Chris Fern of the University of York.“It is even more spectacular than the famous early seventh century helmet unearthed at the Anglo-Saxon royal burial site at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, 80 years ago.“Such helmets were the equivalents of royal crowns in Anglo-Saxon England,” said Mr Fern.But perhaps one of the most fascinating questions raised by the Staffordshire Hoard is what inspired the strikingly unusual design of the probable bishop’s headdress. Was it biblical precedent – or ancient Roman priestly headgear? If the latter, it would suggest a potentially significant additional aspect of continuity between pagan Imperial Rome and early medieval Christianity.One avenue of future research may well be linguistic rather than purely archaeological or historical.Despite the fact that\u0026nbspbishops are depicted bare-headed in Anglo-Saxon art, unpublished linguistic research by Anglo-Saxon clothing and textiles specialist Professor Gale Owen-Crocker suggests that early Anglo-Saxon bishops did indeed wear headgear known as a hufe.Her research suggests that the Latin word for a bishop’s hufe was flammeolum or flammeum. Intriguingly, the pagan Roman priests, whose headgear may potentially have been the original inspiration for the type of bishop’s headdress in the Staffordshire Hoard, were known as the Flamines – and that suggests a potential and tantalising link.The ecclesiastical material all appears to date from the second quarter of the seventh century – and to have been buried some time in the third quarter of that century.The Christian and secular artefacts are being described in full for the first time in the newly-published book\u0026nbspThe Staffordshire Hoard: An Anglo-Saxon Treasure.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe treasure is on display at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and The Potteries Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke on Trent. Although it is conceivable that it was interred for pagan ritual purposes, it is also possible that it was buried for safekeeping – and that its owners never returned to retrieve it.The research into the Staffordshire Hoard has been funded by Historic England.Its chief executive, Duncan Wilson, said: “The range of fascinating objects discovered has given us an extraordinary insight into Saxon craftsmanship and culture and this new monograph gives in-depth detail of everything we know about this spectacular discovery.”To supplement the newly published book, the public can now access a new online information and picture database about the Staffordshire Hoard.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Jack Whitehall’s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared “desperate to shock” as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a “farce”.This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool. While it found success on stage, the big screen version was met with hostility, with one critic calling it guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film.David Hasselhoff is unforgettable as the hunky chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon patrolling a sunny beach in Baywatch. After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world\u0027s most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff’s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show\u0027s former star didn’t make up for the paper-thin plot.Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn’t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink.Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012\u0027s Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. Putting pins in one\u0027s eyes is rumoured to be a better experience.Despite an all-star cast that included Bill Nighy, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon and Tony Jones, the poorly judged spin-off of the much-loved BBC sitcom Dad\u0027s Army (2016) took a pounding from critics, who derided the attempt at an homage to a TV show that had nothing wrong with it in the first place.The nadir of Tim Burton’s career, Dark Shadows was a film nobody was particularly crying out for, most of the fans of the original 1960s fantasy soap opera long dead and the general public having by then grown tired of Johnny Depp’s “heavily made-up comedy weirdo” schtick. Most egregious, however, was the film’s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton’s Batman Returns.Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them – and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals. Absolutely nothing happens in this film where an entire sub-plot involves a boiler being fixed, and another, completely implausible storyline about an assassination attempt on the king. The only real intrigue is why Thomas, the butler, has suddenly acquired a very orange tan. This is what happens when British institutions get a Hollywood makeover, folks.1229 The Dukes of HazzardThere was a time when Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the hottest cast in town. There was never a time this unwanted cinematic revival of the action comedy series wasn\u0027t entirely stupid. Life imitated art when the main stars at the heart of HBO show Entourage hit the red carpet for the film version. Sadly, it lacked the vim that was present in most seasons of the show and ultimately felt like a mediocre feature-length episode.Kevin and Perry Go Large was no doubt adored by teens everywhere upon its released in 2000, which is why it\u0027s gained a cult following in the years since. In all honesty, the film is so terrible it\u0027s actually brilliant.1529 The League of Gentlemen2005 film The League of Gentlemen\u0027s Apocalypse is proof that Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson can do wrong. On the bright side, it\u0027s reassuring to know the multi-talented quartet are indeed human after all. It\u0027s not exactly clear who The Magic Roundabout film was intended for considering kids at the time would have had no idea who Dougal, Zebedee or company were. Save for providing work for Robbie Williams, Tom Baker and Bill Nighy, this version wasn’t much use for anyone. We are all to blame for the abysmal Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys D\u0027Movie. If the sitcom\u0027s Christmas specials weren\u0027t the most-watched episodes of television in the UK every year, then Brendan O\u0027Carroll probably wouldn’t have ever thought a film could be possible. Ricky Gervais just couldn\u0027t stay away from his Office character David Brent and gave him the big screen treatment in 2016\u0027s Life on the Road. Every second paled in comparison to ever single episode of the classic BBC series.The experience of watching the first ever Pokémon film – titled Pokémon: The First Movie – can be likened to watching a YouTube tutorial of someone playing a Pokémon video game, only somehow more boring.The charming story of Postman Pat and his black and white cat in the fictional and busy village of Greendale first screened on the BBC in 1981. What a shame that Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014 – the 3D animated feature film version – managed to stray so far from its original simplicity. It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives – especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot.2129 Sex and the CitySex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert.The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that\u0027s how it should have stayed.Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it’s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless.An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn\u0027t really do much to convince anyone that it wasn\u0027t. Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson\u0027s Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning he called it the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled Kick the Can.Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn’t mean it should have ever actually happened. The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn’t watched the series.Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.Joe Carnahan’s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action. Liam Neeson made for a fun Hannibal Smith and UFC fighter Quinton “Rampage” Jackson did his best as BA Baracus, but a never-more-slappable Bradley Cooper and the chronically unappealing Sharlto Copley were the pits.A sad-all-round adaptation of the cult MTV animated series from the 1990s, Aeon Flux abandoned the avant-garde, largely dialogue-free sensuality of its source material for generic action and dodgy special effects. If it weren’t for the classy presence of Charlize Theron and director Karyn Kusama, whose early cut was radically altered by producers, this would have basically been a bargain-bin Milla Jovovich joint. And that, honestly, would have been a lot more fun.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman must have been grateful when Marvel came along and helped scrub 1998 film The Avengers even further out of cultural memory. But for those who had to endure their hammy 1998 adaptation of the classic spy series, it’d take a lot more than Iron Man and Captain America to make us forget the image of Sean Connery inexplicably dressed in a giant bear costume and trying to control the weather.

That figure is expected to rise further in the current contest.But ads distributed on social media are not subject to the same regulation as press and broadcast commercials and do not have to carry an “imprint” so that voters know who is behind the message.And crucially – as seen in the 2016 EU referendum – digital campaigns are able to direct messages at tightly-defined subgroups of the electorate, targeting them with messages which may not be seen by voters at large or the media.“Social media will be the main battleground of this election, particularly given the limitations that the time of year will impose on traditional doorstep campaigning,” said Mr Lucas, who spoke out as he stepped down from parliament after 18 years as Labour MP for Wrexham.He said his concerns were heightened because of the previous role of Boris Johnson’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings at the head of the Vote Leave campaign, which devoted around 40 per cent of its spending at the 2016 EU referendum to digital marketing.“Political parties will be targeting paid advertising at iniduals and we won’t be aware of how that is being done and the content of it will be completely unregulated,” said Mr Lucas.“The broadcasting and advertising regulators don’t exercise any control over online material so you can basically say anything about anyone. There have been various proposals by our committee, the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner but the issue has not been dealt with by the government.”Setting out his proposal for a voluntary system of transparency which could be put in place for this election, Mr Lucas told The Independent: “All political parties need to commit now to all of the advertising they use online being made available on a central register for others to inspect. In the timetable we have, this is the only practical action we can take.“All reputable parties will want to be honest and open about the advertising they are using, and this would give them an opportunity to show they are being honest. If they refuse to do so, that would mean they were not being honest, they would be dishonest.”Online ads posted on Facebook during the EU referendum were eventually made public as part of the DCMS committee’s investigation into “fake news”, but this did not happen until two years after the vote took place.“In the heat of an election battle, you need to know about these things straight away, so claims can be challenged and inidual candidates can defend themselves against attack,” said Mr Lucas.In its report in February, the DCMS committee warned of the danger of “disruption and confusion” at elections caused by the misuse of social media and called for government to “use regulation to restore democratic accountability”.The Electoral Commission last year issued a range of recommendations to ensure voters can be confident that digital campaigns are following electoral rules.These included imprints for all campaign material, identifying sums spent on digital campaigns and online databases of political adverts.There was no immediate response from Conservatives, Labour or Liberal Democrats to The Independent’s request for them to say whether they are ready to meet Mr Lucas’s transparency challenge in the election.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The drawn-out cries of “Orderrrrr” during fractious but historic late-night votes, the\u0026nbspdramatic pauses before announcements that would shape the course of Britain’s EU withdrawal, the long-winded but momentous rulings that\u0026nbspdashed the hopes of successive\u0026nbspprime ministers.John Bercow will step down as House of Commons speaker on Thursday having outlasted three prime ministers and presided over 10\u0026nbspof the most seismic years in British political history.While some MPs\u0026nbspare already lamenting his retirement, others are delighted to see the back of one of the most isive speakers in modern history.In fact, to say that Bercow was controversial would be to\u0026nbspunderstate the animosity he\u0026nbspinspired in some.Despite having served as Tory MP for Buckingham for 12 years before being elected as speaker in 2009, his habit of siding with parliament against the government meant he quickly became more popular with other parties than with his own.He is despised by many\u0026nbspConservatives\u0026nbspfor his long-winded and often\u0026nbspself-aggrandising monologues, his abrupt rebuttals\u0026nbspand at times petty way of dealing with dissenters and, most of all, for his eyebrow-raising rulings.To his critics, he is an ardent Remainer who has indefensibly abused his position and repeatedly ripped up the rulebook in a bid to frustrate Brexit.To his allies, though, he is a reformer who has repeatedly defended the rights of the House of Commons in the ongoing power struggle with the executive.What both sides agree on is that Bercow’s rulings in recent years have had an immeasurable impact on the course of Britain’s political future and the workings of parliament for years to come.A series of major decisions, all of them contentious, guarantee that he will be a major figure in the history books when the Brexit saga is written up for posterity.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Theresa May holding a third “meaningful vote” on her Brexit deal\u0026nbsp– a decision that forced her to affectively abandon the agreement she had spent months negotiating, and rapidly hastened her demise.\u0026nbspBercow made a similar ruling against Boris Johnson\u0026nbspearlier this month, forcing the prime minister to change tack and first try to introduce legislation turning his Brexit deal into law, and then seek a general election.In between, he took the highly unusual step on several occasions of allowing backbenchers to seize control of the Commons timetable\u0026nbspto pass laws blocking a no-deal Brexit –\u0026nbsprulings so monumental that, without them, it is possible the UK would have crashed out of the EU by now.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from Final Say

in LondonEach time, his decision provoked uproar from Conservative MPs. Each time, Bercow brazenly dismissed it.It’s fair to say that self-confidence is not an area where Bercow is lacking, but he also\u0026nbspsaw himself as a reformer, so the objections of traditional Tories mattered little to him.He announced as much in justifying one of his most controversial decisions:\u0026nbspallowing backbenchers to amend a business motion (a Commons timetable) in January 2019 to force ministers to publish their Brexit strategy much earlier than they had wanted to.Amid a furious backlash from Eurosceptics, the speaker told the Commons: “If we were guided only by\u0026nbspprecedent, nothing in our procedures would ever change. Things do change.”BercowBercow has been credited with helping to modernise parliament, including relaxing House of Commons dress codes and allowing pregnant and unwell MPs to vote by proxy for the first time. He also helped oversee the introduction of a new grievance procedure for allegations of harassment and bullying.This carried with it a certain irony, given that the speaker himself has been dogged by a number of allegations of bullying – all of them denied – in recent years.Several Commons clerks have come forward to allege\u0026nbspthat he verbally harassed them on a number of occasions, in some cases so severely that one employee was reportedly left with post-traumatic stress disorder.He was also criticised after appearing to refer to Andrea Leadsom, then the leader of the Commons, with whom he had a fractious relationship, as a “stupid woman”.For all his insistence that complaints be properly investigated, there was no formal inquiry into Bercow’s conduct, after the Commons standards committee blocked a probe.He will leave parliament without having been forced to answer questions about his conduct towards his juniors.Bercow addresses house after angry exchanges about Brexit and the PM’s languageMany people outside Westminster will know none of this. In the UK and beyond, John Bercow will be best remembered not for his constitutional rulings but for his bizarre style of chairing proceedings.His manner of speaking, reportedly based on his impressions of Jane Austen characters,\u0026nbspsparked news stories around the world and made him an unlikely celebrity in various nations.His particular favourites included turning Tory MP Peter Bone’s surname into a five-second foghorn and calling Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire’s name​ to the tune of Bon Jovi’s “Livin’\u0026nbspon a Prayer”.His put-downs also became legendary in Westminster, with barked orders for\u0026nbspMPs to stop\u0026nbspchuntering from a sedentary position and suggestions that they instead take up yoga among his favoured barbs.None of this will be remembered for long, of course, and Bercow’s enduring legacy is on Brexit. Depending on what happens in the forthcoming election, he may be viewed in time as the man who empowered parliament to avert a catastrophic no-deal exit from the EU.Or, just maybe, he will be lauded by some, and hated by others, as one of the reasons for an outcome that his more conspiracy-minded critics claim was his ambition all along – stopping Brexit entirely.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Harry and Meghan went to Africa, with ITV, and made that trip all about their own anxieties and issues as well, without being half as engaging or sympathetic as Scarlett Moffatt.If anything, I think The British Tribe Next Door will also live longer in my memory than the royal version, not least because C seems to have got more than it bargained for with the Himba, who clearly aren’t big on marital fidelity.Some of the men are already looking to pick off Scarlett from the back of the Moffatt herd and episode one ended with this tantalising offer, from one of the women to her mum.“Betty, let us swap husbands tonight.” .So my interest in this show is now over.DAVID ATTENBOROUGH’S Seven Worlds, One Planet lived up to the usual visually stunning expectations for nearly an hour on Sunday night on BBC.A couple of cute baby animals won their struggle for le, two gender-fluid gastropods had it off at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean and a bull elephant seal on South Georgia discovered: “cm of blubber is protection against the cold, but not from a four-ton opponent” – a bit like Tess Holliday did when Piers Morgan went for her on Twitter.The environmental message was also conveyed, in no uncertain terms, as the seas warmed, glaciers melted and an albatross chick almost got blown to buggery.Then,  minutes into the show, we were suddenly back on South Georgia, with Rolf the seasick cameraman, who was in front of the lens this time and so overcome by the fate of the penguins, and the future of the planet, he began sobbing like Rylan Clark-Neal just after Nicole Scherzinger had put him through to live shows.All the most pointless, virtue-signalling extinction rebels in the country were probably joining in with this gesture as well, even though it’s a moot point as to how close we are exactly to environmental Armageddon.What you can say with a little more certainty, though, is that the moment it starts trying to turn a David Attenborough documentary into an X Factor sob story it’s probably the beginning of the end for the BBC.THE Last Leg, Adam Hills: “Out of ­interest, what would we all dothis ­fabulous industry we’re in fell through for us and we had to go and find a job ”Have you ever considered comedy X Factor: Celebrity, Jenny Ryan: “It’s time for me to share what I’ve got with the world.”Jonathan Ross: “He’s the host of the very funny Mash Report. He’s a fabulous stand-up, Nish Kumar.”And X Factor: Celebrity, Simon Cowell to No Love Lost: “For all the doubters who thought this was going to be a car crash, you’ve proved a point.”It’s a car crash.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “The term Martians refers to the supposed inhabitants of which planet ”Lucie: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What Champion­ship team was originally called The Wednesday Football Club ”Orchid: “Tottenham Spurs.”Ben Shephard: “Which th Century military conflict is also known as The Great War ”Ben Shephard: “In a classic novel by Johanna Spyri, what is the name of the orphan sent to live with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps ”Steph: “Anne Frank.”CHANNEL  disclaimer of the week: “Be prepared right from the very start for graphic scenes of consensual bondage, sadomasochism, dominant and submissive sexual activity, dangerous procedures which only trained professionals should try, nudity and offensive language, all of which are likely to disturb some viewers.”And what an episode of Toot The Tiny Tugboat that was.SATURDAY’S first live episode of X Factor: Celebrity was an assault on two of your senses.The show now looks like it’s set in the display ring of a Herefordshire livestock market, but sounds more like the local abattoir during “Sunday roast” rush hour.Seriously, you dub Jenny Ryan or Ricki Lake singing Stevie Nicks’ Landslide, over a Peta video, the whole country would turn vegan by Monday morning.The miracle of the night, though, was BBC Religion Editor Martin Bashir, who was comfortably worse than both those two and sang like he’d been grabbed nuts-first backstage by Vinnie Jones, yet still got saved by Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger ahead of an understandably inconsolable Olivia Olson.The explanation, I think, lies in the fact Martin brings the precious gt of comedy to X Factor: Celebrity, hopping and skipping across the stage, in his Harold Lloyd get-up, to an old Bert Kaempfert classic.It presented a critical problem, though, for the clearly smitten Cowell, who’d been on the verge of saying the wrong thing all night, but provided the perfect assist on this occasion.“If you recognise that song . . .”Then seriously well done and Danke Schoen, Martin.TV GOLD: Will Sharpe’s scene-stealing performance as Rodney the rent boy in BBC’s engrossing drama Giri Haji.The albatross chick hauling itself back on to a nest and a penguin seal stand-off, from BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet.

In post-Brexit Britain, the key swing voter is “Workington Man” — a typically white man over  who didn’t go to university and voted to Leave.Until recently he was dyed-in-the-wool Labour. Corbyn’s neglect of the working class means he might, for the first time, vote Tory.To win him round, the Conservatives must promise more than the economic freedoms and tax giveaways they are known for.They need to offer protection from a modern world in which liberalising economic policies, globalisation and immigration have undermined work, wages and community.Nearly three in four voters think it has become harder for people like them to make a decent living, so any manesto worth its salt will put ending low pay and insecure work at its heart.For the half of school leavers who lag behind without degrees, the Conservatives should ert funding from low quality university degrees towards technical education.The Tories also need to reassess their long-held devotion to tax cuts. While the cost of living is a problem, the level of taxation doesn’t seem to be.Two thirds of people want investment in the NHS, schools and social care rather than income tax cuts. This may be because households are squeezed more by rent, commuting and childcare than taxes.But people simply don’t believe politicians any more when they offer tax cuts. Instead, the Brexit idend should be focused on improving AEs and classrooms.Building local nurseries, bringing empty and foreign-owned homes into use, and boosting family budgets will win votes.Most of all, the Conservatives need to restore a greater sense of belonging.Think of your own town — the high street is probably in disrepair, libraries and buses have gone, pubs and post offices are closing. Crime is everyone’s concern. The social fabric is fraying and people feel it.New funding for high streets and towns is a start, but why not help communities take over post offices, pubs and football clubs when they go out of business, as we do for schools, or introduce a national civic service for school leavers Labour’s abiding strength is the basic sense that their politics is about looking out for others.But Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour cares more about ending control of immigration and re-running the  referendum than protecting working people.This is the only way he can reach into Labour’s heartlands to win seats like Wigan, Dewsbury and Workington, places that seek security and community over freedom and inidualism.Workington has never ed a Conservative MP in a general election.

Let’s hope history doesn’t repeat itself.For the past three years, our useless political class has pulled every trick to try to stop Brexit. PM Boris Johnson, desperate to end the gridlock, has now shamed these democracy-blockers into holding a general election. It’s a risky move.The electoral system is skewed against the Conservatives. Butopinion polls are right — andBoris can inspire ­voters with his optimism and brio — Brexit really might be unblocked by Christmas. At last!Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, after weeks of political constipation, took a dose of prune juice yesterday and, amazingly, reached a decision. Did you see his face afterwards  Pure relief. He hadn’t been that happy for months.Finally he had seen off the shroud-waving, do-nothing, block-everything Blairite Remainers in his parliamentary party — among them his ­deputy, Tom Watson.They had wanted to keep commie Corbyn swinging in the wind for a few more months. They were still ­moaning last night that he had blown this anti-Brexit ­Parliament’s last chance of securing a second referendum.Corbyn’s repeated refusals to go to the country were making him look like a politician who was scared of the people. Reaction on the doorsteps to his indecision was terrible. No wonder he finally caved.Butthe Labour leader ­yesterday seemed liberated, there were plenty on his ­Commons benches who were aghast at the idea of an ­election in December.“It’ll be too dark!” they wailed. “It’ll be too cold! People will be too busy preparing for Christmas! The students won’t be at university any more!”Too dark and too cold  Does that mean we should only ever have general elections in high summer It was even put about that Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill had advised Boris against calling a mid- December election because church halls would have been booked for school nativity plays.Now I’m as soft as any ­doting dad about kiddies dressing up to play Joseph and Mary but sorry, a general ­election to free our country from this Brexit impasse really might be more important.Why were some MPs so ­miserable yesterday  Most obviously, it was because lots of them think they’ll lose their seats. Anyone with a majority of fewer than , will ­probably be feeling twitchy, particularlyhe or she spent the last three years resisting the ­public’s will on Brexit.Money was another factor. Fighting an election is ­expensive for MPs. They not only lose their Westminster income once ­Parliament is dissolvedbut they also have to dig into their pockets for expenses and ­election costs.All those leaflets, all that petrol and shoe leather, all those late-night takeaways with volunteers — the sums soon add up. A Tory MP once told me that an election campaign cost him £,.But Parliament needs rebooting. At the  election, both Labour and the Conservatives promised to respect the Leave vote — and they duly won most of the seats.But Labour broke that ­promise, as the antics of ­Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Hilary Benn and Co showed. Leave voters in Labour seats are less likely to be fooled a second time.The one unknown in the election will be Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Could it yet lose the election for Boris by taking votes away from the pro-Brexit Tories  What an own goal that would be.Ben Bradshaw, arch- Remainer Labour MP for Exeter, called yesterday’s ­election moves “outrageous”. We were at a “critical juncture for our country”. He plainly thought that only MPs should have a say.Keep the unwashed voters where they belong, eh, Ben  Barry Sheerman, another Remainer Labour MP, professed himself “puzzled and deeply disappointed” by Corbyn’s support for an election.Sheerman feared “the elderly” would not be able to get to polling stations on a December day. Mr Sheerman himself is . If we all took his patronising attitude, we might ask how the old dearie manages to totter down to Westminster from his Huddersfield constituency every week.At such an advanced age, how does Barry remember to tie his laces, let alone make his terrible speeches in the Commons  But no one does ask that, thank goodness, because we do not treat older people like ­simpletons.On Monday Labour MP Seema Malhotra fretted about students losing their right to vote in a December election because they might have ended their college terms by then and have moved back home.  She called this “voter ­suppression”.Oh come off it. She and her Remainer mates were the only ones trying to “suppress” voters — by trying to prevent a ­clearout of this rotten House of Commons.Former Labour MP John Mann shouted: “It’d solve you — you’d lose your seat.” And not just Soubry. Lots of these anti-democrats are now at the mercy of the real bosses of British politics — the voters.I think we’ll just about ­manage to get to the polling station, don’t you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their “people’s vote” would be history.Boris will then pump billions into our police, schools and NHS and keep taxes low enough to carry on creating jobs, as the Tories have since .Corbyn is the least popular political leader in UK history. A dangerous fool loathed even by many Labour MPs.Some have repeatedly denounced him as an anti-Jewish racist, yet they will now knock on doors urging voters to put him in Downing Street. Their “principles” were always a pose.As things stand Corbyn is only likely to win power with the connivance of the Lib Dems and SNP.Which means both a second Brexit referendum — unless they simply order him to revoke Article  — and a second Scottish independence referendum. A Corbyn era would guarantee horric ision for years.That’s before you consider the economic meltdown inevitable in installing a Marxist in Downing Street — impacting everyone’s job, home, savings and pension.Or the chilling threat to ­national security of a hard-left anti-nuclear pacist who considers Britain’s terrorist enemies his “friends”.That’s why Labour tried in vain today to secure votes for children and EU citizens. But polls don’t tell the whole story.Each seat will be split on Leave Remain lines as well as Tory Labour Lib Dem. Those the Tories could lose are easier to pinpoint than the dozens of new ones they must win.Nigel Farage has a huge decision. Only a Boris majority will deliver Brexit. The Brexit Party can be a help or a hindrance. If Boris loses, Brexit is lost too.He has no majority to fend them off or to govern. Parliament is beyond repair. Labour have been a wrecking ball long enough.They have finally realised they cannot hide from the electorate any longer.

But something even more important is at stake.Do we want to continue to live with the free-market economy that has given us wealth unimaginable a century ago  Or do we want to be sucked backwards into the failed socialist experiment that impoverished Eastern Europe in the second half of the th century and has laid waste to Venezuela Labour has yet to produce the radical manesto Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell promised yesterday but we already know there is going to be a hike in income tax for those earning over £, a year — and probably a swingeing wealth tax, given McDonnell’s past enthusiasm for the idea.McDonnell, too, has said he would expropriate ten per cent of the shares of every British company and put them in a fund supposedly for the benefit of the workers — although when you read the small print, workers would receive a maximum of £ in idends per year, with the rest going straight into the Government’s coffers.That measly £ would do little to compensate for the collapse in value of pension funds as Labour nationalised water and electricity companies at below the market value of their shares.Many of those shares are owned by funds on which you and I rely for our retirement.The Shadow Chancellor promises that under Labour, we will only have to work a four-day, -hour week, apparently with no cut in pay. We might as well put Alice In Wonderland in charge of the economy. His sums simply don’t add up.McDonnell says he will increase the National Living Wage to £ an hour. Butlow-paid workers were stopped from working  hours a week rather than the current average of , it would mean a substantial cut in pay for millions of people.That Theresa May was unable to win an outright majority against Jeremy Corbyn and his extreme economic policies in  is as astonishing in retrospect as it was at the time. What was meant to be a coronation nearly turned into a wake. Many Conservatives fear the polls could turn sharply again.But there is scant sign Boris Johnson will repeat Mrs May’s abysmal campaign. His three months in office have brought a change in the weather. We have a Prime Minister who exudes optimism rather than a sense of defeat.While May seemed almost embarrassed to be a Conservative and tried to out-do Labour for proposing the most unappealing tax rise — the “dementia tax” — Johnson has made the case for capitalism and conservatism.The first of those, he rightly points out, pays for the public services we all value so much.He has promised to rebuild hospitals and reverse the cuts in police numbers that took place on Mrs May’s watch.He knows the way to improve the lot of people on low incomes is not to boost benefits but to increase earnings through a higher ­National Living Wage.But he also recognises middle-income groups have suffered disproportionately from the tax system in recent years and has proposed raising the threshold for the  per cent tax rate.While Corbyn and McDonnell would undermine livelihoods by cutting working hours, Johnson’s Tories will encourage us to work and to invest — in our homes, in pensions and savings.

That wouldve been the easiest solution, but it wouldnt look the best.His most natural looking toe is on the outside, so we decided to migrate it inwards to its most ideal position, replacing his fth digit and creating a new big toe.Doctor Wu and his team spent nine hours in surgery to create Ajuns new left foot.The young man revealed he was pleased with the results.He said: I stopped wearing sandals outside since my third year of primary school.Ive never had a girlfriend because Im so imperfect. I never thought Id find anyone who wants to be with me.Now I feel great. Im very grateful to Doctor Wu Xiang.I think my foot is perfect.

No debate.This extremism is feeding into real-le events, including the campaign for next month’s General Election. Just look at the Labour Party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn.Despite presenting himself as a kind and compassionate old bean, Corbyn and most MPs in the current Labour Party thrive on presenting society as a fight between “good” and “evil”, the “few” and “many”, with people like bankers and Tories in the latter group.At every chance they demonise anyone who strays from the progressive orthodoxy.Labour’s shouty MP David Lammy even took this philosophy so far as to compare Jacob Rees-Mogg’s hard Brexit European Research Group to “Nazis” and “apartheid”.In reality, they are simply politicians who have dferent views to him.But such extreme rhetoric has become normalised among Labour. You are either on their side of the argument, or you are a fascist.Labour’s polarised world view is encapsulated in its utterly bonkers set of policies.Any sensible government knows that economic reform takes time, and is often about compromise and improving existing structures.But Labour wants to tear everything down and start again, with private schools being top of the list — no doubt because MPs have a vendetta against Etonians.Corbyn also wants to abolish Universal Credit, despite having no tangible plan for its replacement.Universal Credit is the perfect example of where Labour goes wrong. The system has had teething issues but the answer is not to burn it down, it is to make slow improvements.There are other huge, sweeping pledges the party has made, such as nationalising the railways, water, energy and mail, seizing a ten per cent stake in every private company with more than  staff and having a target of net zero for carbon emissions by .Experts have suggested this could lead to meat being rationed, cars confiscated and the wholesale closure of industries .Who cares, though,it gets Labour in charge!Much of the reason Labour has set upon these radical policies is because shaking up the system is always incredibly exciting for the young, particularlyit looks like it might bring about a few freebies.And let’s face it, it is no surprise that millennials and their younger counterparts can be enticed.They have had a rough ride since the  financial crisis, absorbing the shock of the recession and being decades away from home ownership.It is no wonder they think socialism is the answer, especially as it plays into the woke mindset of there being simple, binary solutions to everything.This is why it is so important that young people actually take on what Obama was saying about the world.The Government has to make large numbers of deeply complex decisions, where there cannot always be winners.Almost always someone will lose out in the intricate interplay that is political decision-making.There needs to be more acceptance of a Margaret Thatcher-style realism: That le is not fair.That is something youngsters do not seem to grasp these days, believing equalities can be remedied with the magic wand of socialism.Strong, long-lasting policies do not make sexy soundbites like “For the many”, nor can they be advertised in protests outside Parliament Square.

What we do has to be secret by the nature of it.“But it’s great to be able to lt the veil on occasion, and show we’re just ordinary people, living in the same places everyone  does, and have played a key part in keeping the country safe over the last  years.”GCHQ also reveal some of the crucial intelligence breakthroughs made in them that saved countless lives.Two of World War Twos’ most important discoveries took place at Ivy Farm, deep in the Kent countryside not far from the M.There, staff cracked what strange ‘noise’ was that had been heard over radiowaves – a highly encrypted teleprinter that Adolf Hitler used to communicate with his field marshals across Europe.The site was also intercepted a fax for the first time, used by the Luftwaffe to reveal bomber squadron formations to the Japanese military so they could better attack the US Air Force.Deep in central London’s club land was  Chesterfield Street, an anonymous town house that is now home to the Bahamas High Commission.For years, it was GCHQ’s nerve centre for Cold War operations, where all soviet targets were worked on by  staff.Standing on top of the White Clfs of Dover was Abbots Clf House, where  female wireless operators intercepted VHF communications from Berlin directing its E-boats in the English Channel.Today, GCHQ has just four sites that it publicly declares – its doughnut HQ in Cheltenham, listening posts in Bude and Scarborough, and the National Cyber Security Centre in Victoria.Leading tributes to the silent spies on the service’s th birthday, PM Boris Johnson said: “GCHQ has been home to some of the brightest people in the country who quietly, and without fanfare, work day and night to keep us safe“Our centenary is a chance to celebrate those achievements and to thank those men and women who have given themselves to this work.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Children were expected to amuse themselves — parenting was not even a word.But then I discovered the books of Roald Dahl, and they transported me somewhere . It was when I first discovered the power of stories, something that has carried me through everything I have gone on to do. I could not have known then that one day I would be writing stories for kids myself. I did not wake up one day and decide to be a children’s writer.It came about when my son Ezra, now , asked me why Harry Potter did not just run away from the Dursleys, the Muggle family he lived with, when he was not at Hogwarts. His question got me thinking and it dawned on me it would be a good idea to write a book for children where they could choose their parents, which resulted in The Parent Agency.I enjoyed writing it and it was very successful, so I wrote more. I’m now on my sixth book and recently had the privilege of reading it to children at Fitzjohn’s Primary School in North London. It is called The Taylor Turbochaser and tells the story of -year-old Amy Taylor, who is disabled after losing the use of her legs in an accident.I did not consciously think, “I’m going to write about a child in a wheelchair”. For me the story comes first. I had an ide about a girl who loved cars, and thought it would add another dynamicshe was in a wheelchair because that would create obstacles and therefore make the story richer and more complicated.I do not think messages in kids’ books should be too upfront as it can make them dull — although ersity in kids’ books is important because it represents the world we live in. Amy is not defined by her disability. She is bright and sparky but just happens to be in a wheelchair. Humour is vital in encouraging kids to read. If you can turn something that is potentially a chore into a joy then you are halfway there.AS a child, I was a big fan of Cat In The Hat author Dr Seuss. He wrote: “The more that you read, the more things you will know.“The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.”What has become a lelong love of books began when my parents read me Dr Seuss’s Grinch stories. And as a parent I continued the cycle by reading to my two daughters.You don’t need me to tell you that reading for pleasure is a good thing.It opens doors to new worlds – down the rabbit hole, through the wardrobe door – in the company of characters who will become friends for le, such as Harry, Hermione and Ron.Books fire a child’s imagination, boost their vocabulary and help set them up for the rest of their livesThat’s why we put such an emphasis on reading in schools. So it’s fantastic to see The Sun’s free Books For Schools programme.These book boxes contain a treasure trove and are perfect for a child to read independently or with their parents.We need all our children reading books for pleasure and this is a great way for them to start.As the Big Friendly Giant might say: “This is where all dreams is beginning.”You should not talk down to children when you write for them. By eight they have a pretty sophisticated sense of humour. Children are much funnier nowadays than previous generations. They have access to the internet and some very funny TV shows.The Amazing World Of Gumball, which airs on Cartoon Network, is the funniest programme ever. Children have the ability to understand complex situations and you do not need to sanitise issues because it makes you as an adult uncomfortable. They are good at filtering out things that do not apply to them and accept discomfort better than many adults do I know there are plenty of challenges when it comes to getting kids reading.My children, Ezra and Dolly, who is now , went to state schools and I know first hand as a parent the challenges that schools face with regards to having decent facilities. But access to lots of dferent types of books is vital for youngsters. Reading well makes a massive dference to their lives in every area.Then there was Roald Dahl’s Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, which I now recognise as a must-readyou want to write for kids. I am so lucky that I have been able to make a living out of telling stories, and that all stems back to the books I read as a child. Without that, I do not know what  I would have done.IT’S simple to start.

A -hour day. “I worked for three hours yesterday before I made a penny because of everything I’m paying out,” he says. “Often I’m working a really long day to make £ or £ profit.” The only things that stop Patrick working are when he’s gone over the mileage limit on the van – meaning he is charged more to drive it. And exhaustion. “If you’re too tired you just can’t stay awake at the wheel,” he says. “People get to a point where they can’t keep their eyes open. We shouldn’t be risking our lives to go to work.” Ken Loach’s searing new film Sorry We Missed You, is the story of millions of Patricks told through the eyes of one family, the Turners. The couple are double-waged through the gig economy – dad Ricky as a courier van driver, and his we Abbie as a ­conscientious carer whose emotionally and physically draining work doesn’t remotely fit into neat -minute visits. As the treadmill gets ever faster, the stress and financial strain builds ­intolerably, slowly pulling apart the fabric of their family.   HOSTILITY“We spoke to many Patricks making the film,” Ken says, speaking as Sorry We Missed You is about to hit cinemas. “These people never stop working, yet they can’t make ends meet.” Set in Newcastle, like I, Daniel Blake, the film carries many echoes of Loach’s masterpiece about the ­brutalisation of social security. “We felt asthe Turners could be the family on the next street, around the corner from Daniel Blake,” Ken says. “The films go together in many ways because when we were in the foodbanks researching I, Daniel Blake, we found so many there were in work – hungry because of the gig economy.” Like Tory immigration policy and the welfare state, this is another hostile environment where workers denied breaks urinate in plastic bottles. “It’s not capitalism failing, it’s capitalism working,” Ken says. Sorry We Missed You is the shameful story of so many precarious workers whose stories we’ve told in this column. The mothers working hours after giving birth or delivering parcels the day of their dad’s funeral. But most of all, it’s told in memory of the late Don Lane, the man who Ken spoke so movingly about last week on Question Time. A -year-old van driver, Don was diabetic but fined £ a day when he went to hospital appointments. On those days he earned nothing but still had to pay for his van. So, he started missing hospital appointments to avoid getting further into debt.    “He collapsed and died,” Ken says. “Now you tell me that’s justied, you tell me that’s right – that a worker is so terried to have a day off for sickness because he will be fined and he dies. That’s the gig economy, that’s what it’s doing to working people.” Loach’s genius over many years, from Kes in  to Raining Stones in  and now, has been to hold a mirror up to lives held back by exploitation and poverty. Sorry We Missed You exposes the shiny new world of the gig economy as the same old abuse of power by venal corporate interests.The film comes out today with ­critical timing – just as Britain faces a general election .This, after all, is the outsourced, zero hour Britain the Tory government has been building since .And it could be their greatest vulnerability at the ballot box because Labour has promised to radically ­overhaul the system.“Ricky is the victim of bogus self-employment,” Ken says of the film.“And the good thing is Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell understand exactly how that is working and how to put a stop to it.They also know that one way to solve Ricky’s problem is to take the post office back into public ownership and use that instead of private delivery companies. Meanwhile, for carers like Abbie, those social care jobs need to come back under direct employment, to the NHS,” Ken says. “This is what Labour will do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tories slip out final straw","story":"NewsTories slip out final straw p rise for nurseries just before general electionFunding for nurseries offering free childcare will rise - but only by p an hour for each childShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  OCT NewsIt is worth p for each child \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCampaigners claim nurseries are facing the final straw after Tory ministers slipped out a negligible p-an-hour rise just days before the election. Funding for nurseries providing  free hours a week of free childcare will rise from £. per child to £. in April  - under %. In a statement slipped out just before the Commons broke up, Schools minister Nick Gibb said it would mean spending £.bn to support nurseries and childminders in England.He said it would deliver high quality care and education and came on top of funds from Chancellor Sajid Javid at the Spending Round in September.But nurseries that have long complained about the low rates branded the rise a drop in the ocean. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, branded the rise negligible and a few pennies.    He added: “These providers are facing huge increases in business costs every year: rises in the national living and minimum wages, mortgages and rents, business rates, utilities costs. “Worst still is the news that those areas that have seen funding fall over recent years will now see their rates frozen rather than increase. For providers in these areas already fighting for survival, this could well be the final straw. It is a key Tory policy to give working parents in England  hours a week of free childcare for kids aged three and four - with an offer for some aged two.Each parent must work at least  hours a week to qualy. Labour has vowed to extend the offer to all two, three and four-year-olds with no means testing at all.The level of funding for the scheme has led to claims it was being starved of cash by the government. Last year the Commons Treasury Committee warned the shortfall in funds was hitting the quality of service and meant poorer parents risk losing out in favour of richer ones. Some providers hiked charges for children who were not eligible for the scheme, such as under-threes, MPs said. Meanwhile parents were being asked to pay for things that were previously free, such as food and activities.

Tom and Victoria Browne, from St Austell in Cornwall, opted for the feast, saying we just donapost do anything traditionally. Victoria, , called up Dominoaposs to find out what they could get for their budget, and the answer was quite a lot, Cornwall Live reports . The mum-of-three said: “Most people know me and Tom just don’t do anything originally. I didn’t want traditional sandwiches or anything at the wedding, I wanted something that stood out.  “We actually kept joking saying ‘shall we have Dominoaposs ’ but as it got closer and we didn’t have any food plans we started seriously considering it and I emailed Dominoaposs asking the question.” To her delight, the restaurant replied saying that it could cater their wedding, but that catering a wedding would be a first for the local branch. “I was so paranoid about whether they were actually going to be able to do it that I went in the day before and said ‘are you are all aware of my order for tomorrow ’” she said. On the big day itself, Victoria and her -year-old husband said that staff came “strolling in and shocked everybody.” They said the food was delivered piping hot as staff laid out the whopping  large pizza boxes,  garlic breads,  boxes of chicken strips and  boxes of wedges accompanied with copious amounts of the obligatory garlic and herb dip.  She said: “They were pretty good. It all came in piping hot and the staff were quite happy to stand and have a photo with me. People are still gob smacked with it, people think that as a buffet you have to have like sandwiches and stuff and I don’t really like pasties and I’m not picking them because everyone  likes them.” The couple said that when they first told people about their plans, that guests were a little sceptical. Victoria said that friends and family were certain in the run up to the wedding that she was just winding them up. She says that even her hairdresser on the day was still questioning whether they were actually going to be offering pizza in place of a traditional wedding breakfast. But the couple said that all doubt was quickly withdrawn when the smell of fresh pizza and garlic bread filled their wedding venue.

Alison said: “I was starting to notice bits of green on the sofa. I thought I was imagining it and dismissed it. But over time it got worse and worse - other people have started to notice it now too. People are starting to doubt it ever was grey. A sofa is a big investment and you buy it for it to look nice and enjoy it, not hide it away, which is what we want to do.” The couple complained to Harveys, which advised them to get a report from a technician and go from there. Harveys has said it can take no further action on the dispute, but the couple is hoping the sofa can be removed and the money refunded. David, , said: “We went through all the correct channels and contacted a technician from a company recommended by Harveys. “The original report noted sunlight damage as the cause but the sofa is a good bit away from the window and parts of the couch that aren’t even in sunlight have turned green too. “We challenged it and were then told it was due to the chemicals used on the sofa.

Louise and Philip Upton bought the Bellway property in Stafford in February for £,.But in the nine months since then, they have spotted problem after problem, reports Stoke-on-Trent Live.The couple - who have four children aged two to nine - decided to have a professional snagging survey carried out. This flagged up more than  problems, ranging from minor imperfections such as cracked tiles to things that breach building regulations and cause safety issues such as not sealing around the flue. Has your new-build dream home got dozens of flaws  Email webnews@mirror    They have been tackling a third of the list themselves. But now the family are calling for snagging surveys to be made mandatory to prevent other people going through the same experience. The Uptons say money should be held back after completion as an incentive for builders to ‘get it right’ in the first place. Louise, , said: “You fall in love with a place and don’t notice some of these things until you’ve moved in. We would never have expected this buying a new build. It’s been an absolute nightmare and you start regretting how much you’ve done and spent on it.    “We paid £ for a professional snagging survey as we had lost faith and think ‘what  have we missed’. They spent half a day here and found  things, but they hadn’t seen everything and, on top of that, we keep finding more. “You feel like you’re picky, but this is our family home and is going to be for the rest of our lives – or that’s what we thought. It’s something that was meant to be an exciting time, but it’s not. The stress that we’ve gone through has been awful. It’s been one of the worse times of my le and it’s reflected on our kids.” Philip, aged , added: “The worrying thing is the builders are under so much pressure to finish that they’re rushed, and problems stem from that.    “Although some of the issues have been rectied, we continue to suffer from obvious defects that should have been picked up and rectied before we moved in. “Because it’s new, people expect no issues. Some of the problems are petty and minor, but we want to make people aware of the experience we’ve had. “We were excited to get in and, don’t get me wrong, we still like the house now, but we are regretting it. If we had the money, we would have moved out already.    The issues have caused both me and my family a great cause of inconvenience and stress, as well as time off work to sort it. “Having strangers constantly coming in and out of your house to sort things means time off work and you just can’t settle. It’s time that builders are held more accountable and so I’m calling for a snagging retention.

Following a succession of visits to the GP, Katie’s discomfort was dismissed as acute period pains and she was advised to ‘learn to live with it’. Katie, a service advisor, said: I felt stupid that this apparent aposnormal period painapos made me so unwell and I couldnapost understand why other girls around me could cope so well with the pain. It was really confusing at such a young age and scary that I could be facing this pain every month for my whole le.’ But when Katie met her now husband Liam when she was  everything began to change.    Starting a family was important to the couple and Katie stopped her contraceptive injection - which she used to dull her monthly pains - in  shortly after the pair married. In November , Katie fell pregnant and a scan at four weeks revealed she didnapost have a misshaped uterus as suggested previously, she in fact has a condition called uterus didelphys. Uterus didelphys is a disorder that develops before birth in which a woman has two uteruses instead of one - a patient can also have two cervixes and in some cases two vaginas. A year earlier the mum-to-be was given the diagnosis of a misshapen uterus when she was sent for an exploratory laparoscopy to look for endometriosis, a painful disorder in which tissue similar to the normal lining on the inside of the uterus grows on the outside. This proved to be incorrect.  In Katie’s case, she has two wombs, two cervixes and a partial vaginal septum as her birth canal is split in two almost all the way down. She said: It wasnapost until I was pregnant and having early scans that uterus didelphys was confirmed. Iaposve been told that my anatomy is one in a million.” In the early stages of pregnancy her child was growing in the left womb, but at eight weeks a second baby was found in the right womb. Two weeks later, doctors discovered the baby in her right womb had stopped growing - but the baby in the left sac was thriving. If both children had been viable, they would have been unidentical twins. \u2028 Katie added: Obviously two babies would have been so exciting but at the same time I was very nervous because itaposs rare to get to full term with just one baby with uterus didelphys, so I was worried about theof time my body would be able to carry two babies. What hurt me most was when people heard I had two wombs they would make comments like aposso you could have a baby in each wombapos. And I explained that there was a baby in each womb to start with, then people would say aposwell at least youaposve got oneapos.

The whole project cost around £,. . Dynamite was used to carve Mount Rushmore followed by a process called aposhoneycombingapos. About , tons of stone was removed of the side of the mountain during construction. . Originally Thomas Jefferson was carved to the right of George Washington. But after  months it was decided that this wasnapost working so Jeffersonaposs face was dynamited off and his face carved on the opposite side.  . The monument is ft high. Each of the Presidentaposs heads are the height of a six-story building, their eyes are  ft across, their noses are  ft long and their mouths  ft wide. . A cave called the aposHall of Recordsapos sits behind the monument and contains a vault of  porcelain enamel  with text of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, biographies of the  presidents and Borglum, and history of the U.S. . The men who worked on the mountain were miners who had come to the Black Hills looking for gold. Although they weren’t artists, they knew how to use dynamite. Remarkably no-one died during construction.    . Mount Rushmore is now visited by more than  million people annually. . Mount Rushmore is granite, which erodes roughly  inch every , years. After about , years, the faces will likely have lost some of their definition. But at this rate the basic shape of the presidents’ heads might last up to  million years. . Mount Rushmore is illuminated every night for two hours.

Aston Hall, in Birmingham, is home to several spirits including Dick the houseboy, who hanged himself after being accused of stealing. Stunned visitors have also reported seeing a former housekeeper sitting in a chair while wearing a distinctive green dress. But the most chilling sight at the Jacobean property is aposthe grey ghostapos, believed to be Mary Holte, a daughter of the fearsome owner who was locked up in a cell at the property for  years after she tried to run away with a servant. Aston Hall was named the UKaposs most haunted heritage site in a list compiled by one of the countryaposs leading team of paranormal researchers.   Spectrum Paranormal Investigations teamed up with the National Lottery for the Halloween list to celebrate its th anniversary of supporting heritage sites.Dean Williams, from Spectrum Paranormal Investigations, said: Halloween is a time of year when many people get to enjoy their fascination with ghostly tales and paranormal experiences at historic sites across the country. In fact, anyone armed with a camera and some sound equipment can enjoy being a aposghost investigatorapos for the night. We have experienced the activity and phenomena thataposs reported at historic venues across the country, and here are ten of the best, all supported by anyone who plays The National Lottery.    Beckenham Place Park and Mansion in Lewisham, London, was second on the list. Over the years, people have supposedly spotted the presence of previous visitors and residents including soldiers and school children, while a hooded ghost has been seen floating on a lake. Castle Espie Wetland Centre in Northern Ireland was third, where a Victorian girl wrapped in a shawl has been seen carrying a baby in one hand and a flickering lantern in another. John McCullough, Castle Espie, learning manager, said: You can hear her crying out for help as she wanders the woods, looking for shelter and warmth. However, when you approach her, she slips behind a tree and disappears.  Other sites which made the list include famous venues such as the Tower of London, Tamworth Castle and Llancaiach Fawr Manor. And at Beddington Park  Grange in Croydon, the ghosts of Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth have been seen riding from the gates of Carew Manor - him with his head under his arm, and she, headless on horseback. The ten haunted heritage sites have been chosen as part of six weeks of celebrations to highlight how National Lottery players have helped preserve and enhance important heritage sites across the UK. More than £ billion has been raised for good causes since the first National Lottery draw in November  - including £ billion to over , projects to support heritage sites.  Eilish McGuinness, executive director of The National Lottery Heritage Fund, said: After  years funding tens of thousands of historic sites around the UK, itaposs perhaps no surprise that a few of them have spooky tales to tell. What better time than Halloween to see some of our amazing heritage, much of which has been transformed thanks to money from the National Lottery. THE TOP TEN aposHAUNTED HISTORICapos SITES  .

I then had to decide very quickly and did not have a lot of options.“I expected something  to come along but I am happy to work with Csaba Laszlo again.“We have a good relationship – not just on the football pitch but outside as well. He is a good guy and I like working with him.”Safranko does see his future back in the UK, however, once he has done all he can to help Sepsi in the Romanian top flight.“I have always said my target is to play football in the UK – I have always seen myself going there some day because the style of football suits me.“There is also a lot of passion for the game there, I could see that at United.“The football in Romania is very dferent from Scotland – there are technical, quick players but the style is not the same.“I loved the style in Scotland, the way the referee would leave the game to play on and it was very physical.“The game there really suited me, I think.”Safranko revealed he’s kept a keen eye on United this season and says he expects them to finally get back to the Premiership.He added: “The guys who have bought the club know what they are doing and bringing in Lawrence Shankland was a fantastic move. I have no doubt about this team and I hope they go up this year.“We had the perfect team last year, in my eyes. I think now they have kept that team and added a special player to it.“Of course, I keep an eye on what the club is doing – you can’t just forget what happened last year.“We don’t get the games to watch in Romania but I do look for the results and any interviews on the internet about the club.”And he hopes to be back on the pitch at Tannadice one day, whether for United or on the opposing side after being linked with moves to Aberdeen and Hibs in the summer.“You never knowI will be back at Tannadice, le is crazy.“Whether it is with United or another team maybe it will happen but Dundee United will always be in my heart after my time there – that will not change.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d970e153c3919.99006593-e1570180930942.jpg ","title":"lawrence shankland ups and downs are part of the game utd must embrace","story":"Talisman Lawrence Shankland insists he knows what he signed up for playing for Dundee United in the Championship and is pleased to see they’re dealing with the ision’s ups and downs.United bounced back from two poor away defeats at Alloa and Queen of the South with a - win over Dunfermline at Tannadice on Saturday, with Shankland opening the scoring with his th goal of the season.The result left the Tangerines three points clear at the top of the table but, summer signing from Ayr United, Shanks knows there are more twists and turns to come.“There’s many ups and downs, probably more than other leagues,” the -year-old said.“You experience it quite a lot, you’re on a high and then there’s a bad result around the corner.“That’s just the way the league is and it’s the same for everybody. We just need to make sure that,we do get a bad result or two, we bounce back in the right way.“We did that on Saturday with a positive result and positive performance.“I knew what I was coming to, I knew I was coming to a big club in this ision especially.“I knew the objectives of the club and for myself as well.“I’m a striker soI go out there and score goals people will take to you.

That’s what we looked to do on Saturday because we knew we had a tough week ahead. It was good to go and get the victory to start the week positively.“It’ll definitely be a tough test. Thistle were always a well-drilled side, even before McCall went there, and they’ll be the same again.“They might even be better but it’s a tough fixture because they’re a good side with good players.“It’s another test like Saturday was which we need to take in our stride and, hopefully, go and get a good result. Obviously the home form is a positive because you need to win as many home games as you can but we’re not going to get carried away and feel like we need to beat everybody.“We just need to turn up and do our jobs week-in, week-out and make sure that we’re performing at our best when we’re at home. vw, px\"  “If we do that, we’ll get results.“We had two disappointing results in the last two games away from home and it’s something that happens in this league.“You see teams dropping points all over the place so it is like that.“If we keep our home form good, though, and win most of our games then we can maybe afford to drop a couple away.“Obviously, we’ll look to go up to Inverness on a real grass pitch as well, which helps, and put on a performance there. But we have a big test tonight first.”Nicky Clark got the second goal against Dunfermline on Saturday after teeing up Shankland, leading the hitman to praise his colleague.“It was good to get back on the scoresheet with a tap in and I was delighted to see Clarky get his first goal and get off the mark as well.“Earlier in the season we had glimpses of playing with each other but he got injured.

of whom I, too, am not a fan # you give not a single example to back up your contention that he is #causing serious economic and social harm to both Argyll and Bute and Scotland as a whole#.While no-one expects the truth from politicians in general, we do actually expect it at a local level.R Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,The Scottish SPCA is urging the people of Scotland to share their stories, photos and memories of the charity as it prepares to celebrate its th birthday.Set up with the goal of aiding overworked horses and ponies in Leith, Scotland’s animal welfare charity was founded on  December .The Scottish SPCA now has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle hospital in Clackmannanshire. Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

auditors.But theyve also been told that further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for  programme.,params: .pushldquoFor example, we are already actively working with NHS Borders to improve joint working, and we also recognise that we need to do more to respond to the Community Empowerment Act in order to encourage and enable people to play their part more easily in their communities.ldquoA key priority for us going forward will be to improve our performance monitoring and measurement to demonstrate on a regular basis that the councilrsquos services are continuing to meet best value and identy quickly areas where further improvements are needed.\"Looking after our most vulnerable people and giving our children the best start in le are key priorities for the council and we are justiably proud of our track record across these areas.ldquoHowever, the report recognises that as a small rural authority covering a huge geographical area we face many challenges in order to improve and sustain high performance across all our service

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul

choice, which would they choose ldquoTechnology isnrsquot helping our children to lead healthy, well-rounded lives. The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

doesnrsquot use it, the person who pays for it wishes it wasnrsquot needed. What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

has  library branches across the county, with its six town libraries reporting the most visits.The only signicant drop in visits was in Wallyford, where the public library closed in November to be replaced by a joint community pupil library which opened in the new Wallyford Primary School campus in April.A report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee said that the move had seen the number of visits to that library service almost halved.And it added: ldquoAlthough we have improved facilities within the school, there is no public transport to the school and limited car parking so some of our elderly customers are not now using the library.However, the report said there were hopes that when the new housing had been completed at Wallyford, where large development is ongoing, public transport would improve.The council put the increase on physical visits to library branches down to a combination of factors, including ldquoincreasing opening hours, merging library and customer services, increasing digital use and dferent types of events taking place within libraries.It said that the number of e-magazines and e-newspapers issued through the library

libraries in recent years and we have seen the numbers of visits increase by nearly  per cent since .ldquoDespite all the challenges which we face, we have continued to improve the library service which we offer through the opening of the new community library in Wallyford Primary School.ldquoThis has given more support for reading and literacy to primary age children in the Wallyford area and we have also been able to maintain a high level of library opening hours in recent years.The report on the service said: ldquoThe library service has changed signicantly over the years and many more services are provided within our libraries than have been previously.ldquo[The library service] continues to adapt to society changes and demands and going forward the service will be developed to promote reading for pleasure in particular and be available for those who need a bit more support, whether this be through giving assistance with digital developments or guidance in literacy or being a place for people to meet and socialise.The most popular library in the county is in Haddington, where the number of visitors to the John Gray Centre facility was , last year.Haddington and Lammermuir ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoHaddington Library is the busiest in the county and that underscores its importance to the town and the wider community.ldquoItrsquos fantastic to see it being so well used and we should continue to explore what additional facilities and services can be located at the library and the John Gray Centre to ensure they continue to attract residents of

Yesterdayrsquos PMQs, with a row over the involvement of American firms in the NHS, was just a flavour of what is to come. At this moment, somewhere in the UK, claims are being painted on the sides of buses and voters need to know who and what to trust. Let the official fact checker dispense with the traditional ldquoon the one hand on the other fuddy-duddy formalities. In this fast-moving age a simple thumbs up, thumbs down will do. No appeals, no refunds, harsh but fair.: Poll shows support for SNP and independenceDONrsquoT: Let us tolerate streams of political cliches masquerading as answers to specic questions. Any interview in which a politician says, ldquoLet me be clear, ldquoWe have always been clear, or any iety thereof, will be terminated immediately and the culprit fined. Likewise, experts, back in fashion since Westminsterrsquos implosion, starting sentences with the word, ldquoSo.DO: Feel free to be a switcher in this General Election. The current Westminster parliament has been notable for the large number of politicians, some  according to the BBCrsquos PM programme, who have switched sides or found themselves suddenly independent. Voters may like to follow their examples and dispense with old loyalties as they see fit. Outwith Scotland, the Tories entire election strategy depends on leopards changing their spots. In general, and due in part to Brexit creating new allegiances, a lot of soul searching will be going on as pens hover above ballot papers. As a result of switching this could be a fiendishly dficult election to call.DONrsquoT: Take Scotland for granted. Goes for all parties, but particularly the SNP, widely expected to sweep the board in Scotland. No sooner had an election date been named than some in the party were framing the General Election as mainly a way to advance independence. Not only is this a risky strategy that could repel as many voters as it attracts, there is a whf of arrogance about it, too. Voters here want to talk about schools, the NHS, the economy and so on as much as voters in the rest of the UK. They have genuine concerns that must be heard. To assume otherwise is to believe wrongly that all is well here, save for a lack of independence. See the history of Labour in Scotland, or the seats lost in the  General Election, for further information on the perils of assuming support is in the bag.: SNP reliant on voters in EnglandDO: Be nice to canvassers. Yes, it is a pain in the neck to have your evening interrupted, but it is an essential part of the ing of democracy. Information is exchanged between parties and voters, sometimes in fairly spirited terms, and pressure released. After the last three years we could all do with some of that. Remember, too, that it is cold outside and it takes some commitment to a cause to go out there ldquoon the knock. Not for nothing was fleece -lined clothing trending last night.DONrsquoT: On the subject of social media, it might be a good time to remind BBC journalists, and one in particular, hello Laura, to pause before they tweet, such is the number of Twitter ldquospats they have been in lately.The latest erupted this week when the BBCrsquos political editor wrongly said the SNP had called a rally in Glasgow this Saturday as part of gearing up for an election. In fact, the event has been organised by The National, The Heraldrsquos sister paper, and has been in the pipeline for months. Ms Kuenssberg, to her credit, issued a correction. Next time, for there surely will be one, remember it is better to be right than quick.DO: Hope that broadcasters, in the run up to polling day on December , find ways of covering politics that prove more enlightening than the current stale models.Heated debates, with  of mostly men shouting at each other, or audience members shouting at them, does nothing to aid anyonersquos understanding. Broadcasters have the upper hand in what is certain to be a campaign with more key players than usual vying for attention. Use it to insist on extended, one-to-one interviews, or follow the American example and have small  quizzing debate participants rather than large audiences. Panels are easier to vet, thus avoiding the inevitable rows when seemingly impartial questioners turn out to be not quite as advertised.: Rude awakening ahead for Johnson DONrsquoT: Forget there is le after politics.

The fact that it is a part of indigenous Maori culture which has been embraced by all races in New Zealand, makes it a special and unique tradition to be celebrated and admired.Recently, when a friendrsquos -year-old son was leaving a New Zealand school after coaching rugby there for a year, I confess to shedding a wee tear as she showed me video of the hundred or so multiracial students performing the haka as a mark of respect for their coach.It is moving and fierce, powerful and evocative, hypnotic and surprising all at the same time. Itrsquos an ancient tradition that has survived the inexorable push towards the homogeneity of Hollywood culture. For that, I think, it deserves a little respect, not smirking, rule-breaking or attempts to drown it out with renditions of ldquoSwing Low, Sweet Chariot.Of course, therersquos an argument to say that the aim was not to disrespect. I mean, we all make mistakes when it comes to othersrsquo culture, rituals and customs, when we simply donrsquot know what is expected of us. lsquoItrsquos no biggiersquo as my kids would say.I have a litany of experience of this. One episode stands out. A few years ago, a Muslim cousin of mine got married to a Sikh. Although the families originated from within  miles of one another on the Indian subcontinent, neither had read the non-existent copy of A Very Handy Guide to Wedding Rituals.The result was a stand-off outside a Scottish country house on the one baking hot day of , that lasted for a painful  minutes, as neither side knew what they should do: a standoff so scary, it put the Soviet American standoff at Checkpoint Charlie in  to shame. We just had no idea what each others rituals were - do we shake hands, exchange gts, we had garlands but who was to put it on whom And it seems Irsquom not alone in my experience of faux pas when it comes to rituals. A Jewish friend recently told me of aat a synagogue where the dferent types of food on the table were carefully chosen to signy certain elements of the past. A soft and gooey food called Charoset signied the cement used by the Jewish slaves in building, and bowls of salted water signied the tears and sweat of those slaves. Just as one man was about to drink the much respected salted water, a non Jewish visitor plunged his hands into the bowl, and started vigorously washing them. Maybe itrsquos the disregard for the rules by the team thatrsquos ripping my knitting. Few, and certainly it seems, not even the All Blacks themselves, argue that a response to the haka is not acceptable, but itrsquos the disregard for authority, the we-know-better than officialdom, which smacks of something more potentially worrying.World Rugby Regulations insist that opponents must stay in their half when the haka is being performed. Some of the England team entered the other half, but yet even with officials shouting at them to get back, they continued to do so. Their fans lapped it up - England won, so perhaps the means justied the glorious end.But is that really a justication for breaking the rules  Most of us teach our kids to obey the rules - at home, in school, on the sports field. Itrsquos part of growing up - being aware of a kind of social contract between us all in gameplay.Elite sportsmen and women are role models for millions of young people and children and to keep sport respected in this way the governing bodies have to formulate rules which canrsquot be seen to be ignored.

For example the fact that Scotland has added around a further pound billion to its debt since  and become a ldquojohnny-come-lately Europeanwill not be up for public scrutiny.Furthermore, it would appear that tactical voting will play a major part on the outcome of the General Election with a number of people holding their noses to vote for the party which can deliver or safeguard either Brexit, Remain, the Union or an independence referendum.

While the date is clear, it is less obvious for whom one should vote where one is not already a paid-up member or ardent supporter of one party or another. It has to be said that the selection of party leaders is not overly impressive. It has to be one of the poorest list of leaders promoting election campaigns in our history.For the Conservatives we have the incorrigible Boris Johnson, who has been known to be economical with the truth on occasion. For Labour we have Jeremy Corbyn, who was once vocal in his support of Venezuela. The current tragic condition of that country illustrates how dangerous the implementation of his doctrinaire socialist policies would be for the UK.The Lib Dems have the opportunistic Jo Swinson, lacking in gravitas, who sees herself, somewhat delusionally, as the next Prime Minister. For the SNP we have the doughty Ian Blackford, the investment banker, living the le of a ldquosimple crofter. His party at Westminster basically and repetitively sings from one song sheet . Do not let us forget the ex-Ukip leader Nigel Farage, now calling the shots for the Brexit Party. In spite of all the predictions of the subsequent profound adverse effects, he would prefer to leave the European Union without a deal.While not being spoiled for choice with regard to the leadership qualities of those at the head of parties and their policies, more and more I have inclined to the view that there is a case for extending the choice available on the list of candidates on the ballot paper,by adding a box to be crossed with the wording ldquonone of the aboversquo.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.PLEASE help our memories by answering the following questions:.

Behailu Kebede, in flat , was found to be entirely blameless, having done all the right things on being woken by his smoke alarm and spotting the fire.:Clutha crash caused by pilots failure to check fuel pumps, inquiry findsHe called for help, closed the kitchen door, alerted neighbours and waited for the fire brigade. Hours later  people would be dead.What becomes more complex - and what is under dispute - is who was, then, to blame for the events of June , . There has been outrage at the suggestion the London Fire Brigade is responsible and pleas that fire fighters should not be made scapegoats for the fatal incident.At the same time there have been calls for the services chief, Dany Cotton, to resign after failures from the service to alter its \"stay put\" advice to residents inside the burning building. Sir Martins report makes clear that more could have been saved had the building being evacuated sooner.The inquirys second phase, expected to be finished in , five years after the fire, will be a deeper investigation into how the fire could have happened in the first place.Footage being shared earlier this week showed Boris Johnson in , responding to concerns raised about cuts he made to the fire service while Mayor of London, with the words \"get stuffed\". The video of the meeting, held not long before the Grenfell disaster, shows a colleague of Mr Johnson raising the issue of a lack of fire safety in housing as a result of the cuts. Get stuffed.It seems far too simplistic to blame the fire crews when, at the top, there was such utter disdain for the service and the resources needed for fire safety.:Inside Clutha pub after helicopter crash revealed as FAI rules pilot errorAt the Clutha Fatal Accident Inquiry it was clear from the start that families of the victims who died when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof of the Glasgow pub did not want the pilot to face sole blame.Instead, they wanted to know whether there had been systemic failings at the top - was there a problem with the helicopter  Had there been problems with training or management or maintenance It was a far cry from the last major Fatal Accident Inquiry in the city when automatic sympathy for the driver of a bin lorry that ran out of control on Queen Street and killed six people quickly turned to disgust as it became apparent he, Harry Clarke, had lied about previous health problems.Yet in the one case where blame did appear to sit with the man at the bottom, rather than come from the top down, Mr Clarke faced no criminal charges.While suspicion of pilot error had been an immediate suggestion and then constant explanation almost since the day of the crash, the Clutha families, and bar owner Alan Crossan, were clear that they did not simply want Captain David Traill to take the blame for the deaths of their loved ones.Captain Traills fianceacutee Lucy Thomas was represented at the inquiry, which ran from April to August this year, and her QC, Shelagh McColl, asked that Captain Traill - an \"extremely accomplished and experienced pilot\" - not be blamed for the crash.Sherf Principal Craig Turnbull could not give her what she asked for. His findings stated that the crash could have been avoided had Captain Traill followed procedure set down in the Pilots Checklist, realised that two fuel transfer pump switches were \"off\" and so not sending fuel to the supply tanks, and switched these on.Had the switches been turned on, there was enough fuel on board to feed the twin engines and the helicopter would have made it back to Glasgow Heliport.This is baldly put and stood out as unfair to the families who had heard evidence lead which gave reasons why Captain Traill might not have checked the switches and why he might not have responded as per the Pilots Checklist in response to low fuel warnings.Captain Traill was wrong to ignore the five low fuel warnings that sounded during the final flight but the court heard clear reasons - relating to issues with fuel sensors in the EC helicopter - why he might logically have ignored them.A less highlighted fact, and one important to mention, is that Sherf Turnbull also found that had Airbus included an aural attention-getter that sounded when both fuel transfer pumps were switched off, the crash might have been avoided.So, disappointment for the families with regards to blaming Captain Traill and not anyone further up the chain.Disappointment too at feeling removed from the process of the inquiry which they waited six years to attend.On behalf of Mary Kavanagh, the partner of victim Robert Jenkins, QC Donald Findlay said that those who died and their families had \"merited scarcely a mention\". It was a sentiment repeated by those loved ones who turned up day after day to the inquiry and sat, dignied, through what must have been evidence traumatic for them to hear.Some wanted questions put to the emergency services who had attended the victims. \"No evidence has been led to show what more,anything, could have been done to save them,\" Mr Findlay again. \"It is submitted that this is what people would wish to know and are entitled to know.\"Of course families wanted clear answers to their questions but, without a black box recorder in the helicopter, any answers were only ever going to be hypotheses. The sherf, too, cannot be solely motivated by pleasing the victims and relatives when conducting a fatal accident inquiry. That is not his role.For those intimately involved it is impossible to separate emotions from proceedings and emotions do not always guide us well.However, it has been acknowledged by James Wolffe, the Lord Advocate, that the FAI system must better involve the bereaved and survivors with improved information sharing. He had pledged additional funding to achieve this, and to speed up a system whereby y delays can further traumatise victims.Sherf Turnbull, in his Clutha conclusions, also highlight the issue of the impact delays have on those involved.The families of those who died in the Clutha accident are not satisfied with the outcome of this inquiry but they will perhaps be satisfied with these acknowledgements.One certainty, at the end of six years, is that the families involved deserve praise for the dignity with which they conducted themselves throughout. Those at the top must match them in a resolve to speed up and improve the system."},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2020-nationals-rally-independence---everything-need-know","story":"The event marks the first time that the paper has arranged a rally.

The research discovered that almost universally, those asked thought that the ‘deal’ being examined at Westminster represented not just the terms of our withdrawal from the European Union but the entirety our future trading and political relationship with the bloc.When told that this was just the beginning and that Brexit itself would trigger years of detailed, high-stakes negotiations and trade talks– the response was a “horried silence”.It demonstrates the mistaken, yet widely held belief that “getting Brexit done” will conclude with the passage of a withdrawal agreement. Yet in reality, the wrangling, the double-dealing and the persistent threat of crashing out without a deal after the transition period are set to go on and on and on.: Brexit: Boris Johnson is learning same lessons as Theresa May – Ian Swanson: Brexit: England seems to be declaring independence from UK – Angus RobertsonPart of the cause of this confusion is that very few political parties are being straight with the public right now, either about what is going on in the Brexit endgame, or how they feel about it.Take the Prime Minister. In , Theresa May proposed what was, effectively, the same withdrawal agreement as the one on the table right now. She was derided for it by both Boris Johnson and the Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party. DoublethinkNow he is at the helm, Johnson has discovered the unassailable boundaries of Brexit and has reheated the same solution to the Irish border problem. Northern Ireland will be both simultaneously inside and outside of the EU customs union, depending on your point of view – “Schrödinger’s Ulster” as the commentator Alex Massie recently put it.Scottish Tories have rushed to embrace this policy and with it the doublethink of their new leader. When Theresa May first proposed special treatment for Northern Ireland in its relationship with the EU, Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resign their positions in response to the threat they believed it represented to the Union.But a poll of Tory members earlier this year suggested that delivering Brexit was more important to them than preventing Scottish independence. The self-proclaimed s of the Union are now pedalling a policy that dramatically heightens the risk of another Scottish border poll and all that comes with it.The mask is beginning to slip for the SNP as well. For three years, Nicola Sturgeon has sought to court Remain voters who voted No in . She’s been desperate to point to independence as a leboat back to the EU . But the First Minister’s ‘stop Brexit’ credentials are starting to ring rather hollow.It emerged last week that her party spent considerably more money chasing , votes in the Shetland by-election than they did campaigning for . million votes in the EU referendum. And people have forgotten that it took them nearly two years to join the campaign for a referendum on the final terms of Brexit. Now that a second referendum might just make it into the Withdrawal Billthey have gone strangely quiet on that front. Instead they appeared to have opted for a swashbuckling push for a snap General Election out of what appears to be a narrow self-interest.No wonder people find politics infuriating right now. They just want political parties to be straight with them about the seismic choices we face as a nation. That starts by reminding them in no uncertain terms that the best deal we could ever hope to strike with the EU is the one we currently enjoy as a full and active member and that the best way to “get Brexit done” is to do away with Brexit completely.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow residents consulted over parades after violent clashes in city","story":"Glasgow residents are being asked for their views on parades and public processions in the wake of violent clashes.Violence has flared at parades in the city in recent months, with police responding to \"signicant disorder\" sparked by counter-protesters to an Irish Unity march in Govan on August .The following weekend, a police officer was injured by a pyrotechnic thrown by loyalist protesters as two republican marches were held in Glasgow city centre.Now, Glasgow City Council wants residents, groups and businesses to give their views on processions - including on whether they have a positive or negative impact on the local community.: Outrage following sectarian disorder in Govan Various questions regarding public processions are asked but the council stresses respondents will not be quizzed on whether there should be a blanket ban on parades, as this lies outwith the legal powers of the local authority.The online questionnaire runs until December  and is part of a wider consultation on processions which includes focus groups and in-depth interviews with key organisations, including those that regularly hold public processions.Consultation responses will inform the review of parades and processions the council announced last month, with a report expected to go before members next year.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"these are the 20 happiest areas in scotland to live","story":"The \"Office of National Statistics asked personal well-being questions to adults in every county and council area in the UK from March  to March  to determine le satisfaction levels of the population.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":null,"title":"exceptional period residence","story":"#Prospect House# is an exceptional period residence occupying a choice mature setting yet is within a short walk to the town centre and facilities of Ballymoney.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free.

Today we come together - community, council, funders and key contributors - to celebrate its successful completion. Well done to all involved!”The completion of this second phase of works on council-owned land has created a scenic riverside trail that stretches  metres and connects Bridge Street and Gilford Community Centre to the attractive Woodlands Park, passing the iconic Gilford Mill building along the way.In addition to creating a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and constructing a new footbridge across the millrace, the council undertook associated works to enhance the trail including landscaping, installing street furniture, lighting and interpretative .The second phase has been completed thanks to £, in funds allocated by SOAR’s Local Action Group. This project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union.Chair of SOAR ABC Roisin McAliskey added: “This project has been completed to an exceptionally high standard, and is exemplary ofhow funds from SOAR’s Rural Village Renewal scheme can be used to support the implementation of local village plans.”Open to the public since July, the new trail is already proving to be a popular destination for walkers, runners and cyclists.Welcoming completion of the trail, Jerome Burns, Contracts Manager, Southern Rural Affairs Division at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  said: “This trail has been completed as part of a suite of village enhancement measures financed through the Village Renewal strand of the Leader Rural Development Programme. It provides a great opportunity for everyone to enjoy the many benefits of outdoor activity, and it is an excellent example of how DAERA is delivering on its vision of a ‘living, working, active landscape valued by everyone.”Given its proximity to Gilford Community Centre, this marvellous amenity set in an attractive riverside setting greatly complements the centre with its excellent indoor and outdoor facilities including a climbing wall, trim trail, picnic tables, pump track, canoe landings and beginners’ canoe slalom course.Alternative Heat are set to expand the firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The council acknowledges with thanks the co-operation of the owners of Gilford Mill, Karl Asset Management, which enabled this project to proceed along with The MWA Partnership Ltd, Landscape Architects and A.G.

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ballotbox_pr8qo2.png","title":"north set for december","story":"POLITICAL parties in the north have put their general election machines in gear after MPs voted for a December  poll.The legislation is expected to be approved by the end of the week when it goes through the House of Lords. MPs votedfor the election by a mammoth margin of  votes to .Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to fight a “tough” election while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the snap poll is a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the country.DUP Leader Arlene Foster said it is right the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box.“The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain,” she said.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.“At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next government how Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.“Unionists need their strongest team ed to so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament.That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Reacting to news of a pre-Christmas election, Sinn Féin Leader in the North Michelle O’Neill said it is an opportunity to reject the DUP, reject the Tories and reject the destructive role of Westminster on the north. “It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit,” she said.#It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.#Sinn Féin has strong candidates who work tirelessly on behalf of their constituents, and we stand ready to fight this election. “Sinn Féin has successfully made the case to the Irish government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. “The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers. The people of the north did not consent to Brexit. “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north. “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.#Alliance Leader Naomi Long said her party is best-placed to unite Remain voices.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. “We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.“We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. “If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup olive branch to nationalists on irish language","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sheep, rats and pigs accounted for % of testing, and the rest were carried out on other mammals and amphibians, including  cats and  dogs.Experimental procedures were carried out on ,of the animals.The rest related to the breeding of genetically altered animals which were not used for further testing.The purpose of the experiments included researching oncology and multi-organ systems , as well as human cancer and other disorders .Researching animal disease and welfare accounted for , procedures and  were used for regulatory purposes, mainly for veterinary medicines.The suffering caused by the experiments was \"moderate\" in .% of the tests, defined as a \"signicant and easily detectable disturbance to an animals normal state\" but not le-threatening.Nearly %were \"mild\", where the pain or suffering at worst is only transitory and minor, while .% were \"severe\" and caused \"a major departure\" from the animals usual state of health and well-being.Meanwhile, .% were \"non-recovery\" in which the entire procedure is carried out under anaesthesia without recovery.Universities and medical schools carried out the bulkof procedures, most on mice and other small mammals.The rest were conducted by non-profit organisations , government departmentsand commercial organisations .The AnimalsAct  imposes clear responsibilities on persons with specic roles in relation to the care and use of animals in scientic procedures. Mr Mullen said: \"While the USPCA accepts that the use of animals in research is required to advance human healthcare, it is disappointing to note the year-on-year increase.\"We would challenge the universities, medical schools and other research establishments to sign up to the principles of replacement, reduction and refinement in order to promote and implement scientic methods that replace the use of animals in research. \"Investment in the Rs has the potential to develop humane, innovative and animal-free science, just as has been achieved in the cosmetics industry.\"A spokesperson for Queens University said research on animals was only carried out when it was \"absolutely essential\" for clinical, biomedical and environmental studies and there are no alternatives.They added that such work, including breeding, was heavily regulated and was subject to equal levels of scrutiny by the University Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body.Ulster University did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster how i want to build a collaborative vision for unionism","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Everyone does not have to agree on everything, every detail. Across the DUP, members have dferent emphases and priorities.We want to build this vision collaboratively.We have commenced engaging with other unionists around our proposals.Some will be right of centre, some left, but all can unite around the merits of Northern Irelands long-term future.

I will seek to stimulate interest amongst other groups and sectors too.We want these engagements to extend far beyond political parties.It ought to be a much broader discussion across the community. Its time to commence a conversation, recognising politicians dont have a monopoly on ideas. I believe unionism to be at its best when it is confident and outward-looking. It should be open and embracing to all, celebrating ersity and permitting iniduals to express the cultural le they choose.People value Northern Irelands place in the United Kingdom for lot of dferent economic, social, historic and cultural reasons.Those who do so come from an equally broad range of backgrounds, and each must be valued and nurtured."},{"url":null,"title":"former president mary mcaleese elected chancellor of trinity college dublin","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Terry Wright, former Vice Chair of the UUP that unionism must jettison treating Brexit solely as a constitutional watershed and move towards a transformed Northern Ireland.  Since government determined solely by a headcount Unionist majority in Northern Ireland proved unsustainable, Unionism has faced a number of internal crises resulting from actions by Westminster governments. Deemed unpalatable and unacceptable, many of these have been met, not with creative strategies but with protest, strident but ineffective pseudo-sectarian - posturing and, on the basis of where unionism stands today, flawed decision-making resulting from deceptive election results and occasionally favourable arithmetic in the House of Commons. googletag.cmd.push Content to agonise rather than organise, Unionism has travelled unerringly down the road of its own failings to become a danger to the Union. It seems that Brexit could soon claim a place as yet another milestone. Whilst the Brexit process, even after three years and more, remains in limbo, with Parliament still to sign off a final Withdrawal Agreement, No Deal, People’s Vote or General Election before detailed trade negotiations can begin, political Unionism is not well-placed. Characterised by disarranged and expedient strategic thinking, it seems ill equipped for relevant political discourse even with the broader pro-Union constituency, many of whom see a need to re-evaluate long held positions. Unionism has moved beyond an age of careless and stereotypical single labels. Within the pro-Union constituency identities are hyphenated and erse. Some identy as pro-Union, economic-unionist, civic-unionist, liberal-unionist and cultural-unionist or a fluid combination of two or more to ying degrees. A large proportion voted to remain in the EU and, in an increasingly personalised society, have no major issues with the delivery of marriage equality, the de-criminalisation of abortion and the provision of choice within ethical parameters. They also see a need to reach accommodation and exercise perspective without bias on rights, cultural and language issues which currently serve as a forum for mutually exclusive combat between the two major parties. In pursuit of their Brexit strategies, the unionist parties, mainly the DUP, instead of engaging in the modern issue-centred discourse which the debate requires, have been content to wrongly categorise Brexit as mainly a constitutional issue and rely on the de-sensitisation of its constituency to the blurred truth, spin and inaccuracies promoted by the Leave campaign. In an act of collective self-deception, it took a reckless gamble with the future and has served to produce the opposite of what it claimed to prioritise with ergence from the remainder of the United Kingdom, a situation which is not itself unusual for the DUP and other Unionists. It grasped an opportunity to wring money from Westminster and allied itself closely to a questionably optimistic pro-Brexit  but in so doing, failed to address the broader ramications of what Brexit could mean for Northern Ireland, socially, culturally and crucially, in terms of reconciliation and stability. It ignored not just the large and erse Remain vote but Unionists, already disenchanted by lack of movement on social issues and concerned by economic and political uncertainty. Had it explored the possibilities within the Good Friday Agreement structures which it now so vigorously defends and embraced the North-South Bodies more energetically, a process might have produced an internalised all-island solution with EU endorsement which facilitated preferred aspirations. Notably, the Ulster Unionist Party moved belatedly toward this position. Now, presented by proposals it does not like, yet facilitated through its tactics, the main party of unionism seems likely to adopt the default position of retrenchment to a place of fear and resistance. Abandoned by erstwhile friends in Westminster who are the epitome of political insincerity and who, seeing Northern Ireland as a handicap to Brexit, have made their priorities clear, this seems a forlorn hope likely to add to the current sadness of spirit within unionism flowing from the trickle-down dys of the DUP leadership. The DUP engaged in a mutually commodied accommodation more to do with opportunism than leadership and the outcome could be predicted. Communal conflict has remained in the minds of too many of its political leaders and this, allied to narrow defensive and cultural politics has led unionism, already discredited by expense scandals which lay bare the moral and pampered relativism of unionist politicians, into a cul-de-sac. As many voters, no longer prepared to be associated with political mediocrity abandon the toxic terminology and one agenda politics of unionist to opt for a pro-Union identity, political unionism needs a re-boot. Those who wish to lead could begin with a robust analysis of the turmoil and abandon the self-deception that Northern Ireland is a place where the will of a unionist majority can always prevail. Unionism is living in the long shadow of Home Rule where diminishing support at Westminster with demographic and changing generational profiles in Northern Ireland indicate that the maintenance of a pro-Union position is no longer guaranteed on the basis of a communal headcount and rests on persuasion for a preferred future. A post-Brexit world that will present challenges is unpredictable, but unionism must look for opportunities that may also present to re-generate. Too often it has lacked an ear for the wrong notes. The Brexit deal which Boris Johnston has brought back from Brussels with its proposals for Northern Ireland bears all the hallmarks of effective lobbying by a business sector, supported by Remain parties, anxious to protect trade and explore opportunities for growth but the obvious uncertainty and confusion of Ministers indicates cause for concern and that all the boxes are not yet ticked that Northern Ireland could be worse off than at present. The clumsy manner in which the values and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement are appearing to be compromised and thrown over by Westminster only serves to tighten the knots. To meet the challenges, Unionism needs to inject stability and focus on a shared future to address the developing situation and build a consensus to solve potential problems across and within regulatory and alignment areas. Livelihoods and public services depend on this being resolved. Now is the time for problem-solving coalitions to build an Agreed Northern Ireland. It will not be achieved by tokenistic changes of label from traditional to expedient grandstanding on second-hand radical liberalismyou still enable sectarianism, segregation and prejudice. The values and attitudes which inform actions are how unionism will be measured and it is presently found wanting by large swathes of its constituency. Substance will always be more important than style and it is the only ethical basis on which you can create the conditions for the realisation of political ideas. Late in the day, Unionism can benefit by sharing responsibility for creating a transformed Northern Ireland and abandoning any desire to dominate the old. Brexit seems to be consigning the dying embers of that particular flame to the dustbin.

He was jailed for three years in December  for causing death by dangerous driving and spent another three years on license.Marty’s parents, Martin and Elizabeth, have had to live with the consequences of the driver’s actions for the rest of their lives. It has also impacted on the lives of his brothers Richard and Ryan, and sisters Michelle and Anne.This week the Department of Justice launched a public consultation into a Sentencing Review. One of the offences up for debate are those “which may result in death, including causing death by dangerous driving”.It seeks the public’s views on whether the current maximum sentence of  years should be increased to le imprisonment or increased to a higher fixed number of years.The Department confirmed to the Derry News that a decision can be taken on these legislative changes in the absence of a minister.The Gallagher family are supportive of le imprisonment being introduced for such offences.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Marty’s father described him as a “great son” who got on with everybody and raised a lot of money for charities through his running.Martin said his son would’ve been a good footballer and got involved in competitive running when he was  or -years-old.On the day Marty was killed, his father was working and didn’t see him before he went into town but said he was joking about with his mother before he left.Martin and his we slept on the third floor of the house with Marty and Ryan on the bottom floor. About am Ryan burst through the door saying, “he’s dead, he’s dead”, and when they asked who they were left in a state of shock. “The man killed Martin at am and then went on to a party,” Mr Gallagher said. googletag.cmd.push  Photo: Marty Gallagher with friend Barry Smith after London marathon No closure Martin and Elizabeth were initially asked to call to the Racecourse Road to identy him but a PSNI sergeant then said it wouldn’t be possible because it was a crime scene. The police sergeant, who still keeps in touch with the family and whom Mr Gallagher described as a “good man”, wanted to spare them the trauma of seeing Marty’s injuries.The following day they were also advised against seeing their son at the morgue but when the coffin was brought home Mr Gallagher said they were in disbelief and it brought “no closure”. “You’re wondering was that Martin and waiting for him to walk through the door,” he added.The man responsible for his death appeared in court for the first time on Martin’s birthday, February . He was sentenced in December  with police saying it was one of the quicker cases of its kind to pass through the courts.“First of all we tried for murder and they wouldn’t give it to us,” Martin recalled. “Then we tried for manslaughter and they wouldn’t give us that either, why, I don’t know.“I think the reason it went through so quick was because the girl testied who was in the back and actually shouted to the driver, ‘Jesus, there’s a fella crossing the road’. Martin was about a foot away from reaching the footpath.“That person who killed Martin was full of drugs and drink but the police couldn’t say when he took the drugs.“We were hoping that he would get at least fourteen years. What they’re trying to do now in England, Scotland and Wales is bring in le for le, but they’re not bringing it in in Northern Ireland.When told the news of proposals that are now on the table in NI to Increase the maximum sentence to le imprisonment for the three serious driving offences resulting in death or grievous bodily injury, Martin was fully supportive, believing it may be the deterrent needed to make drivers take more care.This would mirror the current maximum sentence available for offences such as manslaughter, rape, shooting or wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm. Public support Two months ago the same man responsible for their son’s death was convicted of a number of driving offences but was given a suspended sentence.“Ten years later he has never said he was sorry,” Martin stated, “I will never forgive him.” An emotional Martin said, “it’s like part of our le is gone,” as he implored anyone ever considering drink-driving to think about the suffering of families affected by such tragedies.“You live from day-to-day for your other children. You might’ve seen the ad on TV about the man living with depression who pulls the mask off at night, you just put a front on for people.“It gets no easier over ten years, people say it gets easier, it doesn’t, you learn to live with it just that’s it. If you didn’t have a good family and marriage, it would wreck your family.”And every time he crosses paths with his son’s killer it makes it worse, he added.Support from the local community has helped to lt the family’s spirits over the years. Last weekend  members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club ran the Dublin marathon in memory of Marty.One of the founding members of the club, Harry McNulty, ran his st and final marathon on the day – Marty was a prodigy of Harry’s when he joined Foyle Valley.“With Marty’s run every year we’ve raised about pound, for Derry charities. Over , people turned out at the start of the month.“It’s great to see what they thought of Martin and the money going to charity.“Last year we gave Altnagelvin a bed and it has Martin’s name on it but we try to spread it out. “The support gives us a lt and it just shows you what people thought of Martin,” Mr Gallagher concluded. .

Public support Two months ago the same man responsible for their son’s death was convicted of a number of driving offences but was given a suspended sentence.“Ten years later he has never said he was sorry,” Martin stated, “I will never forgive him.” An emotional Martin said, “it’s like part of our le is gone,” as he implored anyone ever considering drink-driving to think about the suffering of families affected by such tragedies.“You live from day-to-day for your other children. You might’ve seen the ad on TV about the man living with depression who pulls the mask off at night, you just put a front on for people.“It gets no easier over ten years, people say it gets easier, it doesn’t, you learn to live with it just that’s it. If you didn’t have a good family and marriage, it would wreck your family.”And every time he crosses paths with his son’s killer it makes it worse, he added.Support from the local community has helped to lt the family’s spirits over the years. Last weekend  members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club ran the Dublin marathon in memory of Marty.One of the founding members of the club, Harry McNulty, ran his st and final marathon on the day – Marty was a prodigy of Harry’s when he joined Foyle Valley.“With Marty’s run every year we’ve raised about pound, for Derry charities. Over , people turned out at the start of the month.“It’s great to see what they thought of Martin and the money going to charity.“Last year we gave Altnagelvin a bed and it has Martin’s name on it but we try to spread it out. “The support gives us a lt and it just shows you what people thought of Martin,” Mr Gallagher concluded. .

For boys, it’s Leos who are assumed to be the most self-assured.The study, which analysed the opinions of , teachers, children and parents in the UK, found that Brits are quick to make assumptions about a child based on their first name, with strong stereotypes associated with each of the names featured in this year’s top  baby names list. googletag.cmd.push The national results found that children named George are considered by both adults and their peers to be the most intelligent in class, with over one in  believing this is the most intellectual name from this year’s top  boys names list.

Two days later, two further sinkholes appeared, and a huge split broke the pitch in half and spread to the clubhouse and car park. The grounds were immediately shut down, and the misery was compounded a few weeks later when the club were relegated from senior football for the first time in  years.This season they have made use of alternate venues as the work continues to re-establish their own home, with a GoFundMe page raising tens of thousands towards the project. The club – who have appeared in six of the last  Monaghan Senior Club Championship finals, with the most recent appearance in  – have secured their position back in the senior ranks for next season, but first they must deal with the business of Ulster.For Foreglen, it’s a familiar position. At the start of the Derry championship they were ranked as dark horses, but were few people’s out and out favourites. Bar a first round replay against Faughanvale they barely faltered on the way to the showpiece, but still there were few in their corner against Claudy. It mattered little as they held the Mitchel’s to one score – a free – in the second half to claim a - to - win. O’Brien’s coach Muldoon believes they can take serious confidence not just from the result, but from the nature of the performance.“I think after the replay with Faughanvale, as the championship went on our confidence just got better and better and we’re going into this game now off the back of a big performance,” the Ballinderry man told the Derry Post. “My team talks are very brief before a game because we do the work in training. The boys know on the day what they have to do, who they’re marking, what the plan is for kick outs – it’s all organised.“We’ll sit down this week and look at Magheracloone. There’s not a lot of information or videos out there but we’ll get our planning done and be ready for the challenge. It will probably be a case of giving it five or ten minutes and then making the switches that we need to.“It’s bonus territory for us, and it’s unknown territory too. We know they’re going to be a very good, strong side and we’re expecting a tough challenge but it’s one that we’re all looking forward to.”From the scenes on the pitch in Celtic Park after their victory two weeks ago to the social media posts from Foreglen clubhouse in the following days, the togetherness of the whole community has come to the fore. Even as a man not from the club, Muldoon said it was something special, and something they’d like to repay. “After the final whistle I stood back and saw my two boys running onto the pitch in their Foreglen tops and I shed a tear. They’re a small parish, and I know a lot of them are the same, but in that clubhouse on the Sunday night, I’d never seen a crowd like it. “We said to the lads last week that when it came to Ulster there was a choice to train a few times or put the heads down and give it a rattle. We want to set an example for the county and to be fair they’ve put the shoulder to the wheel for their community.“It’s a day out for everyone to jump on a bus together and head down. Who knows what’s going to happen, but we’ll all be sticking together as a team and with the supporters and we’ll give it everything for them.” googletag.cmd.push FORGET ODDSDespite all their dficulties last year, Magheracloone still managed to reach the senior championship semi-final, defeated by eventual title winners Scotstown. The enormity of the task at hand isn’t lost on Muldoon, but he insisted that the underdog tag hasn’t been an issue for his men so far – they’re relishing it.“We’ve been happy enough to take the underdogs tag. Before the Claudy game there were a lot of people who thought we had no chance, but we didn’t care,” he insisted. “The boys all got it out of their heads and we focused on ourselves.“To be fair, Claudy were rightly favourites because they were head and shoulders above anyone in the league, but we knew what we were about and we knew what we were doing. The whole favourites thing is all part of the build-up, but we won’t read too much into it this time either.”Both played five championship matches on their way to their provincial titles, with the Monaghan side both scoringand concedingmore than Foreglen, who scored - and conceded -. Even with county level players like Gavin Doogan and Tomas Freeman on the other side, Muldoon reiterated his faith in the O’Brien’s defence, and he feels the forward line can take confidence knowing that they will get opportunities.“In training and in all our games we have the same set up – it’s man to man marking, no sweepers and no hiding places, and we’ve no plans to change that,” explained the coach. “In the build-up to the final nobody was giving our defence any credit, it was all about the Claudy forwards, and vice versa about our attack.“Our defence is tight, the boys talk to one another, you have the likes of Oisin and Shane Duffy in there and they’re all told what to be doing before the game. Them boys don’t have the cover of a sweeper, but they do their job, they back themselves against their man and they have confidence as a unit.”For the seasoned professionals like Oisin Duffy, Mark McCormick and Kevin O’Connor, the pressure of an Ulster quarter-final won’t weigh too heavy on the shoulders, but Muldoon said he is particularly delighted that the younger squad members, like Liam O’Hara, Sean, Cahir and Caolan O’Connor, have all shown that they can handle the mental pressure of the big occasion. It’s a quality he feels will stand them in good stead come Sunday afternoon.“I sat down on the Saturday night before the game with Claudy and rang some of them young lads and said to them that I knew what they were feeling, and they’d got us there through talent and enthusiasm. They worked hard all year in the gym, but they had to go out and treat it as any other game,” he explained. “In fairness to them they did, and I thought every one of them were immense. “Now getting the chance to play in Ulster – it’s a brilliant experience for them young cubs and it’s one that will definitely stand to them.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two days later, two further sinkholes appeared, and a huge split broke the pitch in half and spread to the clubhouse and car park. The grounds were immediately shut down, and the misery was compounded a few weeks later when the club were relegated from senior football for the first time in  years.This season they have made use of alternate venues as the work continues to re-establish their own home, with a GoFundMe page raising tens of thousands towards the project. The club – who have appeared in six of the last  Monaghan Senior Club Championship finals, with the most recent appearance in  – have secured their position back in the senior ranks for next season, but first they must deal with the business of Ulster.For Foreglen, it’s a familiar position. At the start of the Derry championship they were ranked as dark horses, but were few people’s out and out favourites. Bar a first round replay against Faughanvale they barely faltered on the way to the showpiece, but still there were few in their corner against Claudy. It mattered little as they held the Mitchel’s to one score – a free – in the second half to claim a - to - win. O’Brien’s coach Muldoon believes they can take serious confidence not just from the result, but from the nature of the performance.“I think after the replay with Faughanvale, as the championship went on our confidence just got better and better and we’re going into this game now off the back of a big performance,” the Ballinderry man told the Derry Post. “My team talks are very brief before a game because we do the work in training. The boys know on the day what they have to do, who they’re marking, what the plan is for kick outs – it’s all organised.“We’ll sit down this week and look at Magheracloone. There’s not a lot of information or videos out there but we’ll get our planning done and be ready for the challenge. It will probably be a case of giving it five or ten minutes and then making the switches that we need to.“It’s bonus territory for us, and it’s unknown territory too. We know they’re going to be a very good, strong side and we’re expecting a tough challenge but it’s one that we’re all looking forward to.”From the scenes on the pitch in Celtic Park after their victory two weeks ago to the social media posts from Foreglen clubhouse in the following days, the togetherness of the whole community has come to the fore. Even as a man not from the club, Muldoon said it was something special, and something they’d like to repay. “After the final whistle I stood back and saw my two boys running onto the pitch in their Foreglen tops and I shed a tear. They’re a small parish, and I know a lot of them are the same, but in that clubhouse on the Sunday night, I’d never seen a crowd like it. “We said to the lads last week that when it came to Ulster there was a choice to train a few times or put the heads down and give it a rattle. We want to set an example for the county and to be fair they’ve put the shoulder to the wheel for their community.“It’s a day out for everyone to jump on a bus together and head down. Who knows what’s going to happen, but we’ll all be sticking together as a team and with the supporters and we’ll give it everything for them.” googletag.cmd.push FORGET ODDSDespite all their dficulties last year, Magheracloone still managed to reach the senior championship semi-final, defeated by eventual title winners Scotstown. The enormity of the task at hand isn’t lost on Muldoon, but he insisted that the underdog tag hasn’t been an issue for his men so far – they’re relishing it.“We’ve been happy enough to take the underdogs tag. Before the Claudy game there were a lot of people who thought we had no chance, but we didn’t care,” he insisted. “The boys all got it out of their heads and we focused on ourselves.“To be fair, Claudy were rightly favourites because they were head and shoulders above anyone in the league, but we knew what we were about and we knew what we were doing. The whole favourites thing is all part of the build-up, but we won’t read too much into it this time either.”Both played five championship matches on their way to their provincial titles, with the Monaghan side both scoringand concedingmore than Foreglen, who scored - and conceded -. Even with county level players like Gavin Doogan and Tomas Freeman on the other side, Muldoon reiterated his faith in the O’Brien’s defence, and he feels the forward line can take confidence knowing that they will get opportunities.“In training and in all our games we have the same set up – it’s man to man marking, no sweepers and no hiding places, and we’ve no plans to change that,” explained the coach. “In the build-up to the final nobody was giving our defence any credit, it was all about the Claudy forwards, and vice versa about our attack.“Our defence is tight, the boys talk to one another, you have the likes of Oisin and Shane Duffy in there and they’re all told what to be doing before the game. Them boys don’t have the cover of a sweeper, but they do their job, they back themselves against their man and they have confidence as a unit.”For the seasoned professionals like Oisin Duffy, Mark McCormick and Kevin O’Connor, the pressure of an Ulster quarter-final won’t weigh too heavy on the shoulders, but Muldoon said he is particularly delighted that the younger squad members, like Liam O’Hara, Sean, Cahir and Caolan O’Connor, have all shown that they can handle the mental pressure of the big occasion. It’s a quality he feels will stand them in good stead come Sunday afternoon.“I sat down on the Saturday night before the game with Claudy and rang some of them young lads and said to them that I knew what they were feeling, and they’d got us there through talent and enthusiasm. They worked hard all year in the gym, but they had to go out and treat it as any other game,” he explained. “In fairness to them they did, and I thought every one of them were immense. “Now getting the chance to play in Ulster – it’s a brilliant experience for them young cubs and it’s one that will definitely stand to them.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Co. Tyrone mumpreneurs - Joanne Gallagher and Stephanie Rice – launched Good Vibes in their home town of Strabane in June this year, after identying a gap in the market for alternative and holistic treatments in the town. Joanne said, “I felt the benefits of alternative and holistic treatments personally and wanted to know more, so after much research I trained to become a Meditation Coach, Reiki Master and NLP Practitioner. “I have always been passionate about wellness and in recent years have practised privately, offering holistic treatments such as reiki and meditation to clients who experience symptoms including anxiety, stress, aches and pains, among other things.“I feel passionately about the benefits of alternative therapy and since Stephanie, my best friend from secondary school also practised within the field, it just made sense for us to join forces.”Joanne and Stephanie offer a iety of alternative therapies, including reflexology, massage, meditation and yoga in a safe and friendly environment that allows clients to explore which practice works best for them. Joanne and Stephanie welcome a wide range of clients to their studio, from alternative therapy veterans to those who are new to holistic healing techniques. Stephanie, who is a reflexologist, Indian head masseuse and Aromatherapy Specialist and plans to train as a yoga teacher next Spring. Said: “Helping others is something I have always loved doing. I am passionate about alternative therapies and have experienced first-hand the effect these, combined with the power of positivity, can have. “Opening my own business was something I had always dreamed of and with Joanne also working within the industry, it seemed like the perfect opportunity for us to partner up to bring the dream to le. Joanne and Stephanie turned their idea for a business into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme, which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Ireland’s wide network of enterprise agencies.The Go For It Programme, provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn people’s ideas for a business into a commercial enterprise.Stephanie commented, “We had the passion for health and wellbeing, but beyond our qualications and training we didn’t know how to put it all together into a sustainable business model. That’s where the Go For It Programme came in and really helped us. “The programme helped us with everything from marketing strategies to financial planning. The Business Advisors were very attentive and explained everything to us in great detail, and we both felt really informed and supported throughout the whole process.

There is something haunting about the idea of a lost love a relationship that never quite ran its natural course and could be reignited someday. Perhaps it’s not surprising that one in five people long to get back with an old flame, and now a new television show from ITV is searching for pining lovers in the Derry area. The team who make ‘Long Lost Family’ have been reuniting people with missing family members for a decade now they want to bring romantic soulmates together after years apart. googletag.cmd.push They have approached Derry Now for help, believing that the recent history of Northern Ireland may have indirectly resulted in a few star-crossed lovers. The turbulence of The Troubles and waves of migration to and from Northern Island in the latter part of the th century mean many couples may have been separated by circumstances. If this sounds like you, they want to hear your story. The programme idea was inspired by the story of KT Robbins, an American serviceman who fell in love with an eighteen-year-old French girl, Jeannine Ganaye in  and recently reunited with her after  years apart. The Derry area has provided similarly heart-warming stories in the past. Avril Trenklet and Bob Fanuce proved that true love never dies when they wed nearly  years after first meeting. Local factory girl, Avril first met US Marine Bob in  when he was stationed at a Naval base in Derry. After a whirlwind romance the couple got engaged but Bob got cold feet and called it off. As the years passed and they got on with their lives, both marrying other people and having families, but Avril says she always knew in her heart that one day they would be together again. One day out of the blue Avril, who was now widowed, got an email from Bob, sparking their reunion and shortly afterwards a second proposal. This time the wedding went ahead and the pair finally got their happy ending. The Long Lost Family team are looking for more lost loves like Bob and Avril. They only intend to reunite people who are currently single and happy to meet as friends … who knows, the spark might still be there. So,you want to reconnect with someone special from your past call    or email longlostloves@walltowall. .

British Prime Minister Harold Wilsons oft-quoted aphorism proved true once again this week, with the EU granting Britain yet another Brextension.March  came and went, October  the same, then, on Monday past, British Prime Minister Boris Johnston accepted Friday, January , , as the day Britain would, maybe, finally leave the EU. Undeterred by the interminable political machinations, multi- disciplinary artist, Duncan McKellar, on Simdau ast staged his “Giant Artwork Against Hard Borders” fields adjacent to Killeas Church of the Immaculate Conception.Speaking before the event, Mr McKellar said he was “very happy” with the support from the gathering local communities. He had plotted out a -metre-wide circle in two fields taking in both sides of the border with participants standing beside little bamboo markers he had placed in the ground.“It is at the same time, a protest against hard borders and a celebration of the communities around the hard borders. “Hopefully, we will end up with some nice video from the drone and some nice photographs,” he said.Mr McKellar arrived in Killea  days before the “Giant Artwork” took place and said the local “engagement” had been “fantastic.”He said: “People are enthused by the novelty of the idea. There is a palpable warmth. The Irish stereotype holds up very well.“I have been getting lots of help and lots of advice. People have been bending over backwards to help. Just this morning, Ive laid sawdust at the entrance of the field to cover up the mud and Miacuteċeaacutel, who runs the timber merchants, took it round on a truck and said, Anything I can do just let me know.”Introducing himself to the assembled crowd, Mr McKellar explained his work often used mirrors and often took place in border communities. He said: “Last year, I managed to organise a long line which stretched for  kilometre on each side of the US   Mexico border.“We also had a huge group of people on the White Clfs on March , the day Brexit was originally meant to happen. “We sent a giant SOS call to mainland Europe with our mirrors.“With the focus turning to the Northern Ireland border, I thought it was an appropriate time to come here. We are going to form a big circle, to symbolise the strength within the community here and also to show the strength of feeling against hard borders because obviously it used to be right there, the checkpoint.“We will walk to the brow of the hill. The border itself is the Liberty Burn at the bottom of the field. The sun will hit the mirrors and, as well as adding a bit of fairy dust to the images and drone footage, they symbolise the human spirit,” said Duncan.Patrick ODonnell who owns a garage in Killea said he got involved in Duncans Giant Artwork Against Hard Borders to support the artist.Patrick said: “I came along this morning to support Duncan and to protest against Brexit. The artistic aspect of the protest appealed to me.“The idea of hands across the border appealed to me. We dont want a hard border again, we dont want a border at all, basically.“As a business person, I think a hard border would be a disaster, a disaster totally,” said Patrick.The next thing Duncan has in the pipeline is maybe an installation in Palestine. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments. He acknowledged the importance of projects tackling social isolation and poverty and the need to address mental health and suicide in our local area.Nicholas McCrickard, CDRCN manager, presented the work of the organisation and reported that an increasing range of activities and projects were delivered to a high standard.He thanked the board and staff for a ldquofabulous year and acknowledged that the community and voluntary sector from Bangor to Crossmaglen was a thriving and creative place which was tackling issues relating to health, the economy, the environment and more.ldquoWorking together with the local Councils and Government departments is key to our success, he said. ldquoOur communities have a powerful voice coupled with large numbers of willing volunteers and we have risen to the challenge of tackling mental and physical health problems.The evening concluded with a talk from local photographer Raphael Mason on how photography can impact on peoplersquos physical and mental wellbeing.

Conor Woods got Ballycran moving in the eighth minute with a converted free, but Dunloy responded with two-in-a-row from Elliott and Nicky McKeague to go four points clear.Liam Savage kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play, but a goal and a point from Cunning eased Dunloy into a - to - lead by the th minute.Woods and Cunning, via a rsquo, swapped points before Liam Savage grabbed his second score of the game in the th minute.Two further Ballycran points from Woods reduced the arrears to four points by the th minute, but Paul Shields and Chris Brogan stretched Dunloyrsquos lead to - to - after  minutes.Woods registered Ballycranrsquos seventh point in the th minute, but Dunloy finished the first half scoring with points from Shields and Cunning as the Antrim side went into the break with a commanding - to - lead.The scores should have been much closer as Ballycran registered six wides in a competitive first half.Woods opened the scoring after the break, but Ballycranrsquos uphill challenge got even harder when Gerard Hughes was given a straight red card, forcing the peninsula side to play the remainder of the game with  men.Cunning and Woods exchanged points before Ryan McGarry, Elliottand Molloy helped Dunloy storm into a - to - lead midway through the second half.A point from Liam Savage slowed Dunloy up for a while, but they quickly regained the initiative and points from Elliott, Eamon Smyth, Cunning and McKeague had the Cuchullains - to - ahead with six minutes remaining.Woods scored a late point for Ballycran, but it was quickly cancelled out by points from Molloy and McKeague and a goal at the death from Anton McGrath to put the game to bed.Ballycran: Stephen Keith, Michael Hughes, Sean Ennis, Gerard Hughes, Brett Nicholson, Padraig Flynn, Patrick Hughes, Liam Savage , Phelim Savage, Scott Nicholson, Conor Woods , Michael Ennis, Stuart Martin, Colum McManus, Chris Egan.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area. A public advertisement of the proposals is then required. It is expected that this process will be complete in December .ldquoThe Policing and Community Safety Partnershiphas increased the number of Community Safety Warden patrols in this area over the last few weeks as a deterrent to reports of anti-social behaviour.ldquoThe PCSP will continue to work in partnership with the PSNI to ensure that warden patrols are appropriately deployed across the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area where reports of anti-social behaviour have been received..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Fond.jpg","title":"Fond farewell to council chief  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council have bade farewell to their retiring chief executive, Mr Liam Hannaway.The celebratory event, which was hosted by council chairman Charlie Casey took place last Tuesday at Killeavy Castle, near Newry.Paying tribute on the evening, Cllr Casey reflected on Mr Hannawayrsquos many years in public service and his dedication to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He said: ldquoLiam has spent  years in public service.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn. Also Lady Pym who was representing the local senior citizensrsquo Friendship Club.BALLYGALGET mdash A request from the school management committee of St Patrickrsquos Primary School at Ballygalget to provide transport for  pupils has been turned down by the local Education Board.The school management committee had explained to the Board that the  infants end their school day officially at .pm, but there is no transport to take them home until .pm.The school committee requested action because there was no teacher available to supervise the infants who had to remain in the school building.The transport officer of the Board, Mr Milligan, stressed that seven of the children were below compulsory school attendance age and as such were not eligible for school transport.Outlining the background to transport facilities provided at the school, Mr Milligan pointed out that an Ulsterbus had carried the children to and from the school for over  years.It had not generally been the practice of the Board to provide buses to take the children home before the end of the normal school day and there were no Board vehicles free to provide transport.Despite a y debate, the Boardrsquos Educational Services Committee said they could not suggest a solution to the problem.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick priest Dr Joseph Maguire has been re-elected chairman of the finance committee of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Maguire told members of the committee that he considered it an hour to be re-elected and he promised to serve the interests of the committee and the Board in every way that he could.COMBER mdash Proposals by Comber traders to prevent moves which they say could threaten their businesses, may well be turned down.The threat is in the shape of the Department of Environment who have announced that they intend introducing parking restrictions in the main shopping areas of the town.The confrontation between the Department and Comber Traders Association has been long running, but on Thursday it seemed that a solution could be found.The Traders Association had an on-the-spot meeting on Thursday morning with a representative from the Roads Division, who listened to the tradersrsquo complaints and suggestions for the siting of the yellow lines in the town. Also present was a representative from the RUC traffic branch.However, there are fears that the tradersrsquo suggestions will be dismissed and the Department will push ahead with their proposals to restrict parking in Comber.The Traders Association feel that the proposals are a very real threat to their livelihood and are inconvenient mdash a view shared by many residents in the town who have backed the Association in their fight with the Department..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Greenkeeper.jpg","title":"Greenkeeper gets revenge at sunny Spa  ","story":"SPA golfers faced a novel end-of-season challenge on Saturday when head groundsman Lee Cartmill set up the -hole course for his Greenkeeperrsquos Revenge competition.It was essentially a fun event which attracted a large number of both ladies and gents and proved to be so popular it is likely to feature again on the Spa calendar.But the devilishly dficult pin placings did not deter Alan Carson who topped the leaderboard with a magnicent score of  points while Catherine McEvoy won the ladies -hole competition with  points.Spa PGA professional Gary Wardlow warned competitors that the pins were in ldquorather unusual positions but after a number of impressive scores were ed he reckoned it had not been sufficiently challenging.Stuart Alexander had his best start for many months with eight straight pars followed by a birdie at the par four th, but unfortunately his great run did not continue.At least two other competitors mdash Sam Boyd and William McAnally mdash also had birdies at the th where the pin was placed in the left-hand green side bunker.Menrsquos results: st Alan Carson , nd George Wilson , rd Chris Chittick , th Stephen Adams , th Brian Graham .Ladiesrsquo results: st Catherine McEvoy , nd Vivienne Abernethy , rd Carol Shields ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Hat-trick.jpg","title":"Hat trick of titles  ","story":"IT was a case of trebles all round recently for a highly-talented teenager from Kilmore.Eighteen year-old Conor Mullan, a son of well-known Crossgar garage owner James Mullan, was in seventh heaven after adding the Ulstermotocross semi-expert title to the Irish and Ulster Youth crowns won earlier in the the year.Conor blazed his way to victory in all three competitions and crowned a sensational year at Desertmartin last week when he clinched the Ulster title, despite riding with a few niggling injuries, including a troublesome shoulder.To clinch Ulster and Irish titles in the same year is some achievement and Conor has done it in style.The Year  pupil at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, now has his focus on sitting his A-Levels next year ldquoI am in Upper Sixth at the minute, taking A-Levels in geography, technology and business studies, he said.ldquoNext year the plan is to go to university, where Irsquod like to study business, or economics.

Together, we want to deliver inclusive, transformative regional regeneration, strengthen our economy and boost our prosperity.Ambitious plans to revolutionise tourist facilities in Newcastle are part of the City Deal proposals and are making signicant progress.Ground condition survey work is taking place in the resort at the base of the Mournes where a new a gondola ride into the heart of the mountains would be based, with the local council confirming that it is planning to appoint a dedicated team to deliver an outline business case designed to pave the way to secure funding to help build the project.An economist is also to be appointed to help with the delivery of the business case which is expected to be completed in early spring or summer.The Gateway proposal is one of the key projects included in the local councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.The world class tourist attraction proposals include the gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain with the proposals expected to be delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.Other proposals include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.Council officials are also working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the ious projects through a series of key

that a le-extending drug will be made available free for their young son who has cystic fibrosis.Jen Banks and her husband Dermot were told yesterday by the Department of Health that Northern Ireland would follow the lead by NHS England and make Cystic Fibrosisdrugs Orkbambi, Symkevi and Kalydeco available to eligible patients.It is hoped that their two year-old son, Lorcaacuten, and other CF sufferers will be offered the drugs within weeks.The initial cost of a yearrsquos supply of the drug was estimated at pound, per patient.Last night Jen told the Recorder that she and her husband were ldquoecstatic but the news still has sunk in after they were called to a meeting with Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengelly at Stormont.The surprise announcement came as the couple were preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos hands within  days, starting rightly so, with those most in need.The mother of two admitted that living with Lorcaacutenrsquos condition and knowing that there was a drug that could dramatically improve his quality of le was ldquoabsolutely horrendous.ldquoIn many ways we feel that Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy has been stolen from us, Jen said of her first child who was diagnosed at  days old.ldquoThe torture wasnrsquot that he had CF, it was that there was something that could help him but there was a company out there that was pricing the drug so highly, it was unobtainable.Jen believes that Lorcaacuten will be on the drug before Christmas and recognises this as a gt of le.ldquoItrsquos not that this is just a good Christmas present but that we have actually been given extra Christmases with our son, said Jen.ldquoOne of the models for the drugs suggest thatyou start it at age six, you can have an extra  years on top of the normal le expectancy for a CF sufferer. ldquoItrsquos like we have been given  Christmases with Lorcaacuten, that it what it really means to us.Lorcaacuten currently needs two sessions of physio each day and uses a nebuliser five times a day along with  tables to absorb fat from his food.He has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last Christmas.Jen said: ldquoHopefully, by taking the drugs, it will mean that will be the end of the infection and he wonrsquot get other infections.ldquoIt gives us even more time to keep him healthy until the better drugs come along.The  year-old has been one of the most vocerous campaigners to have the drug make available in Northern Ireland.She and her husband planned over the summer to move to Louth as the drug is free to patients in the Republic of Ireland but the sale fell through.The mother of two also vowed this week ldquochain herself to the railings at Stormontthe Department of Health did bring the drugs to Northern Ireland.Jen also praised the Recorder for its ldquocontinued and compassionate support of her familyrsquos storyldquoAll of the coverage made us feel that people really cared and we canrsquot thank the paper enough for its support, added

true for singer Mark McMullan, who has just landed himself the lead role in a major touring production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.Mark will follow in the footsteps of Jason Donovan and Philip Schofield who played Joseph when he takes to the stage in Doncaster for a five-month tour from December .The role is Markrsquos first major performance in a national stage musical and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars in local musicals with the St Patrickrsquos Choral Society in Downpatrick.Mark has been a constant help and support to his older brother, Declan, and parents John and Brenda after Declan suffered a cardiac arrest at the age of . Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything. Declan, of course, wanted to tell the world but we didnrsquot want to say until Mark knew for definite it was  per cent.ldquoWe are hoping to travel over for his first show as this will be a great stepping stone for him.While the opportunity may have alluded the talented  year-old until now, Mark said he is ready for the challenge.ldquoIrsquom not nervous about performing as Irsquom definitely ready for this but Irsquom a bit nervous about the other performers who have played the role and feel an obligation to be good and do everyone proud.Mark has already appeared in a youth production of Joseph as the Pharaoh, having performed with St Patrickrsquos Choral Society from the age of  to .He said that while he grew up in a musical family, it was his grandfather, Seamus Mullan, and mother, Brenda, who really encouraged him.ldquoI knew I could sing from an early age as Irsquom from a musical family, said Mark. ldquoBut it wasnrsquot really until I joined the choral society and sang publicly for the first time a few months later in Calamity Jane that people began to tell me I was really good.ldquoPeople told me that I could make a career of singing and it began to occur to me that maybe I could do this.ldquoMy granda was a member of St Patrickrsquos Choral Society and sang in the choir of Mary Mother of the Church in Saintfield. The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre. Unfortunately when that happened I had to put that dream on hold.ldquoI never thought I would look at it again as I knew I had to help Declan and my family, but unwittingly, the bad thing that happened to Declan has actually helped me pursue that dream even more.ldquoHe is my biggest supporter, hersquos like my manager. I speak every night to my Mum and him and he wants to know everything.Mark will continue with his job as architect while living in Newcastle-upon-Tyne with his partner, Zoe Hunter, who he met while they were students at Down High, until he feels confident that a secure future lies ahead of him in musical theatre.ldquoIrsquom also doing a Masters degree in architecture so between work, studying and rehearsal, le is very busy at the moment, he added.Bill Kenwrightrsquos production of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webberrsquos musical will play in Doncaster from December  to January  before continuing its UK tour in Peterborough, Aylesbury, Wimbledon, Coventry, Bradford, Chesterfield and Sunderland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting on bypass plans  ","story":"ROADS issues topped the agenda during a meeting in Downpatrick last week including progress on the multi-million pound Ballynahinch bypass scheme.South Down MP Chris Hazzard led a Sinn Fein delegation which met with senior Department of Infrastructure officials at Rathkeltair House.The MP was joined by South Down MLAs Emma Rogan and Sinead Ennis and councillors Oonagh Hanlon, Cathy Mason and Willie Clarke.Mr Hazzard said roads officials provided the delegation with a detailed overview of the local situation, including the impact of successive government austerity budgets on the departmentrsquos ability to maintain the network, invest in much-needed new public transport infrastructure and deliver the appropriate winter service in the months ahead.The MP said that despite the dficult operational environment, it was pleasing to hear that the roads department is continuing to deliver much-needed improvements, including progressing with the final legal stages of the Ballynahinch bypass.It was also confirmed that work is continuing on congestion alleviation schemes in Downpatrick and much-needed road safety enhancements in Mayobridge.ldquoWe also discussed the imminent public inquiry of the vitally important A junctions scheme, perhaps the highest priority local roads scheme given the huge road safety advantages that scheme is likely to deliver and the Newry southern relief road, said the MP.ldquoI was also pleased to hear roads officials speak passionately about delivering a number of park and ride facilities that will help meet the growing demand for modern, fit-for-purpose public transport options in the local area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Niall.jpg","title":"Niall backs start up loans plan  ","story":"THE founder of a Castlewellan business which makes an intelligent outdoor storage solution has been chosen to champion UK start-ups by the government-backed Start-Up Loans programme.Niall Greenan from The Smart Bunker was one of  business founders honoured at a reception at Westminster last week to celebrate some of the UKrsquos most successful small businesses.The Smart Bunker is an easy-to-use dispensing system which releases coal with a simple pull of a lever to fill the bucket to the required amount that can be carried.Mr Greenan , came up with the idea when he realised how dficult it was for his mother, who has arthritis, to fill a coal bucket from her traditional coal bin.He used a pound, Start-Up Loan to develop the device, which has gone on to win several awards.Mr Greenan has also expanded The Smart Bunker to include safe storage of wood pellets, ice treatment and animal feed.The product has attracted attention for its sustainability credentials, providing a good alternative to the plastic bags usually usedfor agricultural storage.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives.

There are a lot of people who are obsessed with the show. I kept a diary and took notes,’’ he said.Novelli, who visits his Belfast restaurant on average every two weeks, said he thought taking part in the programme would be ‘Mickey Mouse, but it wasn’t.’’‘‘I thought it will be easy, it’s TV, but it wasn’t. The way they do it is very clever. The hunters are real hunters, they are not actors.’’And trying to evade constant surveillance made him ‘‘very paranoid’’. ‘‘I am quite strong and I can take a lot, but you come to the point where day after day, it’s a lot. ‘‘We were offered a psychiatric assessment after the show and even now the offer still stands. This demonstrates the level of paranoia that we had and how serious the show was.’’And speaking of the tension between himself and Aldo Zilli, he said: ‘‘We have known each other for  years, but what was amazing was that straight away on day one we were in a helicopter and I thought it was going to be a nightmare with him, and he probably thought that about me as well it was like playing tennis with stones. ‘‘Several times we had no foodand also we didn’t get on.

So we were told that the plane wouldn’t be allowed to take off.Novelli took part in the show following his son Valentino’s battle with a rare form of cancer, neuroblastoma. The three-year-old was given the all-clear from the cancer diagnosis a year ago, but has now been diagnosed with severe autism.‘‘Valentino is good. he’s alive, from where we have come from, that is quite something. ‘‘He can’t speak so we have to learn sign language to communicate with him.’’try catch  TrendingEssex Police hunt N.I. brothers Ronan and Christopher Hughes wanted on suspicion of manslaughter of  men and women found dead in refrigerated trailerCounsellors brought into NI school to help pupils after teen killed and four others hospitalised in horror crashTeenager killed in NI road traffic collision -

The party has shrunken considerably in North Belfast over the last decade. Robert Foster, an Antrim and Newtownabbey councillor, was the UUP candidate in the  assembly election, the last time the party contested North Belfast in an election. Last night he told the News Letter he had no ambition to be candidate this time, citing his business and council work.Another potential candidate, Mark Cosgrove, the UUP’s treasurer and the party’s group leader on Antrim and Newtownabbey Council, said that due to business commitments and his council work he did not want to be a full-time politician.Yesterday the Belfastpublished a letter signed by  north Belfast unionists who called on Mr Aiken not to contest the constituency. One of those who signed the letter, Dean McCullough, was described as chair of Rathcoole Neighbourhood Renewal. It did not mention that Mr McCullough is also a DUP councillor, and therefore might be expected to endorse the party policy of allowing Mr Dodds a free run.When asked about that, Mr McCullough told the News Letter that his DUP political role was not mentioned in the letter because he had signed it in his community capacity.The letter was signed by other unionists from ious backgrounds, including PUP leader Billy Hutchinson and Belfast County Grand Master of the Orange Order, Spencer Beattie.NI people offended as McDonalds Portugal apologises over Sundae Bloody Sundae Halloween advertising campaign Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was also signed by a sitting UUP councillor, Frazer Agnew, and someone who was a UUP councillor until May,Davy Browne.The letter set out “strong opposition” to the policy espoused by Mr Aiken, arguing that the “only consequence” of challenging Mr Dodds would be to help Sinn Fein.The letter, which was restrained in tone, said: “The North Belfast seat holds a special place in the heart of the unionist community across Northern Ireland. The seat once held by Edward Carson, since its creation, North Belfast has always ed a unionist Member of Parliament.“For decades the unionist community in North Belfast faced the brunt of the sectarian murder campaign of the IRA. It was the collective unwavering resolve and unity of purpose amongst our community that gave us the strength to carry on. It is that sense of unity and standing together that continues to define the unionist community in North Belfast to this day.“Whilst we the undersigned come from dferent political viewpoints, as unionists, we are all united in our desire to ensure North Belfast s a unionist Member of Parliament.”It went on: “Nigel Dodds has been the collective choice of our united unionist community in North Belfast.“The only consequence of running a candidate against Nigel will be to help Sinn Fein. Only Nigel can retain this seat.”When asked for Mr Aiken’s response to the letter, the UUP responded with a brief statement from a party spokesman.The statement did not state unambiguously – as Mr Aiken did earlier this week – that the party will unquestionably be standing in North Belfast.Instead, it simply said: “The letter has been received and we are listening respectfully to all views in the community.”The last time the UUP stood in North Belfast constituency was the  assembly election the party took , votes. In the  general election, even with the UUP standing aside, Sinn Fein was just , votes behind Mr Dodds.l Morning View, page ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- Traffic and Travel   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Traffic and Travel      Four vehicle road traffic collision on N.I. road - emergency services at sceneThe PSNI is at the scene of a four vehicle road traffic collision.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections. We must resist Tory attempts to close down our democracy. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is fierce competition to host the All Ireland Fleadh each year as it attracts thousands of visitors and musiciaans from across the world. Councillor Mark BaxterAt Monday night’s meeting Sinn Fein welcomed the success of their motion, tabled by the party’s group leader Darren McNally, which asked council to investigate the feasibility and economic benefits of hosting the Fleadh Cheoil Na hEireann in Armagh.Cllr McNally said it would be ‘a massive economic boost for the entire borough’ with a potential £m for the economy.“I believe Armagh would be a very fitting venue given the rich ancient heritage and culture the city possesses’”#However DUP Cllr Mark Baxter said: ““We are hugely disappointed that we were the only party to vote against this potential colossal spend by council in these very tough economic times. The other parties were quite happy to task officers to investigate bringing the Fleadh Cheoil to Armagh despite the huge cost involved.” “Ironically it was only three weeks ago that Sinn Fein refused to back another much smaller proposal for a community event citing a lack of council resources. I would question in the strongest possible terms the economic benefits and the motives for bringing such an event and why the UUP and Sinn Fein are so keen to bring the event to Armagh which has in the past had some very controversial artists. Indeed we all can point to similar festivals recently held in Belfast where its very clear that ‘unionists’ were not welcome with Pro-IRA chanting and bands imploring the British to “go back home. “I would call on councillors to reflect on this wanton disregard for the public purse and remind them of their responsibilities in delivering first class services for best value. The DUP make no apology for being the champions of low rates in council.”Sinn Fein Cllr Liam Mackle dismissed claims by the DUP‘s Mark Baxter that the motion committed council to a massive spend as untrue.He said: “The passing of this motion gives council officers the freedom to engage with numerous stakeholders holders including Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who organise the Fleadh Cheoil to get a better understanding of what’s expected of any host venue, Council officers will bring back a report to committee following engagements with local businesses, hospitality sector, community groups and traditional musicians, where Councillors can have an informed debate on its feasibility.“We have seen the DUP on ABC council spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on a whim - on events with no economic benefit to our borough. Their behaviour is somewhat childish, compared to the mature approach of this motion.”Musician Willie calls for better rehabilitation for stroke survivors Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
