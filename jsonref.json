Employees of Zaman gather after it was seized in a crackdown against Gulen supportersAfter Erdogan became the President in 2014, he survived an attempted coup by factions within the military and went on to win the referendum on increased presidential powers.At the time, Erdogan said that the plot was engineered by the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who headed up a network of schools educating people about the Hizmet movement, which promotes altruism and modesty.Since then, Turkish courts have jailed dozens of officers for alleged coup plots after the failed attempt, which claimed at least 240 lives.According to officials, Erdogan’s life was also put in danger while staying in Marmaris, but he was back in less than 12 hours with a TV appearance during which he declared himself a ‘chief commander’.Although the Turkish President has resolved economic problems, he has also been considered to be an autocratic leader who is against anyone who opposes him.Despite denying that he wants to impose Islamic values and revealing that he is committed to secularism, his supporters still refer to him as ‘Sultan’, a reference to the Ottoman Empire.Turkey lifted the ban on women wearing headscarves in the country’s state institutions in 2013 but bids to criminalise adultery and introduce alcohol-free zones failed.          Supporters of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan wave national flags as they wait for his arrivalErdogan has also stated that ‘no Muslim family’ should consider birth control or family planning because of his aim to ‘multiply our descendants’.The AKP has also managed to keep inflation under control after the 1990s when it soared above 100 percent, but in 2014, the economy started to change and unemployment rose above 10 percent.Erdogan wifeRecep Tayyip Erdogan married Emine Gulbaran in July 4, 1978 and the couple have two sons, Ahmet Burak and Necmettin Bilal and two daughters, Esra and Sumeyye.2018 Turkish electionsErdogan declared victory in the Turkish presidential election in June 2018 amid speculation of ‘manipulated’ results and the President received the executive powers he has sought in order to tighten his grip on the nation.The AKP will now rule over Turkey until 2023 after its victory in parliamentary and presidential polls, taking 42.5 percent while Erdogan garnered 52.5 percent of the vote. The opposition’s candidate Muharrem Ince, took nearly 31 percent.President Erdogan will now form a government as well as appoint ministers, vice presidents and top bureaucrats. He will also be able to issue decrees, prepare budgets and impose states of emergency.The role of prime minister has now been scrapped and is thought to further dilute democracy in Turkey under Erdogan’s one-man rule.Erdogan net worthRecep Tayyip Erdogan’s net worth has accumulated to approximately $58 million (£44m) and is the richest Turkish politician according to Top Richest. Erdogan was also listed as the 48th most powerful person on the 2018 Forbes list.However, this figure seems a little high for someone who just earns $58,000 (£44,000) a year, as reported by German newspaper Bild. The article then went on to cite data published by Turkish opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet which stated that all members of the Erdogan family appear to be in business.Bild also revealed that Erdgogan\u0027s son Ahmet’s net worth amounted to around $80 million (£60m) and made claims that he may be supported by the Turkish government.Erdogan’s other son Bilal, who frequently garners media attention for alleged criminal activity, now lives in Italy after being embroiled in a political corruption scandal.The Turkish President also has one of the most lavish official residences in the world, the Ak Saray, otherwise known as the White Palace, which has a whopping 1,100 rooms, 250 of which are for the sole use of the Erdogan family.Thought to be 30 times the size of the White House and believed to be the largest palace built anywhere in the world for more than 100 years, a reported £7 million was spent on carpets and another £5 million on 400 10ft high double doors.The silk wallpaper is thought to have cost £2,000 a roll and one drinking glass in the household is worth £250. Due to the numerous spas, swimming pools, bathrooms and steam rooms, the heating bill is thought to run up to £500,000 every winter.

She has remained a loving person and is always ready to help. She is not arrogant and despite all the success and fame, she still has got much love in her heart.\u0027There were so many friends and relatives in need and she never said no.\u0027I believe that success came to her because she is immensely hard-working. She achieved it solely on her own, without any nepotism.\u0027The woman who gave birth to the future catwalk queen at the age of 20 said Natalia grew up very quickly from the age of six when her sister Oksana, who suffers cerebral palsy and autism, was born. \u0027Maybe Natalia\u0027s success is a gift from above, because she alone took care of her disabled sister Oksana. Natasha was always there for Oksana. From the age of six she knew how to look after a child.\u0027Larisa orced her husband and has since re-married and had a third daughter Kristina, but she said the cornerstone of their fight for survival in impoverished conditions was the girl who would grow up to become a super star.\u0027I could leave the sisters to go to work, being sure that Natasha would do all the cooking and washing, as well as take care of the child.\u0027And I think that her love and hard work became the basis, which still helps her keep up.          Natalia\u0027s mum said despite her international background, having  married  an English man and now with a French man, her daughter is supporting her country to lift the trophy in Moscow          Natalia, pictured with three of her five children, is excited by her country\u0027s showing in the World Cup so far, her mother Larisa says. She added: \u0027We talked about the World Cup yesterday. She is amazed by the results of the Russian team\u0027  Natalia, pictured left in front of the Kremlin and right in Moscow, has used her global fame to help promote the World Cup \u0027Her friends would often mock her because of the disabled sister. They wouldn\u0027t want Oksana to hang out with them and Natasha would say \u0027We either go together or we don\u0027t go at all\u0027. You see a boomerang …everything returns to you.\u0027 The big sister left home when she reached 17 to pursue her dreams having seen her father walk out and being forced to sell berries from a barrow in freezing local markets to help her family. \u0027When she first left Russia at 17 she could not even speak English, and the modelling agency did not provide interpreters. She used to attend drama classes as a child, so she always knew how to present herself.\u0027But Natasha never finished school.  She didn\u0027t take her exams, so she has no high-school diploma. But we are proud of her. For me she is not a famous woman, not a star, but my daughter. I am overwhelmed with pride.\u0027In fact, knowing how hard-working and persistent she is, I understand how she has become so successful. When she has a goal, she strives for it and she never gives up.\u0027 Bidding her eldest daughter farewell as she took a plane from her hometown which was known as Gorky under Soviet Rule, she said she could never have dreamed her daughter would find world-wide fame.Natalia has modelled for Givenchy, Prada, Calvin Klein, Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Gucci as well as representing Stella McCartney, Hugo Boss and Gucci and H\u0026ampM.She has also been a cover star of magazines the world over and has received Vogue India\u0027s Women of The Year awards and had a doll made of her in Russia. \u0027I had no idea that she would become so famous. When she was leaving, I knew that it was the beginning of something big, but not that big,\u0027 said her mother.Larisa\u0027s home has an old 1990\u0027s-style TV and few mod cons in the kitchen, where a cupboard door is hanging from its hinges.On entering, the only clue that this is a family which has travelled is a fridge magnet of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, where Larisa visits her daughter twice a year.    Mummy\u0027s girl: Natalia\u0027s is close to her mother, Larisa, pictured. They talk on the phone every day and meet up at least twice a year either in  Russia or elsewhere depending on her schedule          Larisa, pictured with Natalia\u0027s grandmother also Larisa said: \u0027Unfortunately, we don\u0027t see each other often, because I can\u0027t leave Oksana. We meet about two times a year.          Natalia, pictured when she was five years old, grew up in a family struggling financially after her father walked out on her mother leaving her to bring up their daughters alone          Natalia\u0027s grandmother Larisa, pictured, gets to see her granddaughter more often as she goes to stay with her for several months at a time in Paris. Larisa added: She added: \u0027I visit her regularly and she is an extraordinary person. I say this not just because I am her grandmother\u0027She said: \u0027Unfortunately, we don\u0027t see each other often, because I can\u0027t leave Oksana. We meet about two times a year.\u0027We talk on the phone every day. Usually, we meet in Moscow or somewhere abroad. However, her grandmother travels more frequently. She flies to Paris a lot and stays there for a month or two.\u0027Her beaming grandmother said the model is always respectful and courteous and has not had her head turned by the star-status afforded her.She added: \u0027I visit her regularly and she is an extraordinary person. I say this not just because I am her grandmother.\u0027Her children are incredible too. Her eldest son Lucas always accompanies his mother. Her daughter Neva attends ballet classes. And her husband Antoine is also very nice. They dine together traditionally and the children are always engaged in the conversation.\u0027I really enjoy visiting them and my husband Viktor, who passed away 5 years ago, loved it too. The model has five children three with Justin Portman, 39, who is half-brother of the Viscount Portman, who she married in November 2001 and split from in 2011.She later began a relationship with Antoine Arnault, the CEO of mens\u0027 clothing brand Berluti. They have two sons Maxim, four, and two-year-old Roman. The catwalk queen is also an ambassador for the World Cup where four matches are being played in her city, including Sunday\u0027s match which saw England thrash Panama 6-1.           Family time: The model has five children three with Justin Portman, 39, who is half-brother of the Viscount Portman, and two sons from her current relationship with Antoine Arnault (pictured) CEO of mens\u0027 clothing brand Berluti But her mother said, despite her international background, marriage to a member of the English aristocracy and relationship with a French man, there was no doubt who her daughter was supporting to lift the trophy in Moscow in July.\u0027I think Natasha will support Russia. She always does. I am not sure though.\u0027Maybe she will also support France now, or maybe England. You know, three of her children are English, two are French, and she is a Russian, that is why it\u0027s hard to tell.\u0027We talked about the World Cup yesterday. She is amazed by the results of the Russian team.She added: \u0027There is a joke among Nizhny citizens, that we must thank god for the World Cup, as our city has finally been modernised.\u0027The area around the stadium used to be a horrible place. Now, I often go there to visit my friend, and when I first saw it I didn\u0027t recognise it.\u0027In our district now, most of the roads have been repaired. The government promised to fix the entire street. Many places were planted with trees.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/26/11/4DA4677600000578-5886745-image-a-13_1530009970806.jpg","title":"Helipads cinemas climbing walls private vineyards home Americas extreme home","story":"    Inspired from a scene from Arabian Nights is this five-bedroom property in Potomac, Maryland.

In 1993, the Ministry of Defence deemed the facility surplus to requirements, and the entire complex was decommissioned and sold. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/26/13/4DA5190700000578-5887201-image-a-30_1530016489040.jpg","title":"Whoops Bungling tank driver loses control crushes pensioners VW Belarus","story":"    Dramatic footage captures the moment an out-of-control army tank crushed a pensioner\u0027s car as it swung around a corner on a road in Belarus          While the first tank successfully negotiated the corner, the second appeared to take the bend too sharply and swerved or skidded onto the wrong side of the carriageway - before crushing a Volkswagen Polo waiting at a red light  (pictured)          Aftermath: Pictures from the scene show the vehicle\u0027s roof on the driver\u0027s side crumple under the tracks of the giant tank          Wreckage: Incredibly, a pensioner and his grandson who were in the car managed to escape with just a few scratches          The clip shows two war machines roaring on to the road in the city of Grodno in the western Grodno Region of Belarus before one of them loses control and crushes a VW PoloThe clip shows the vehicle\u0027s roof on the driver\u0027s side crumple under the tracks of the giant tank.Bus driver and passenger are killed in horror crash with...Powerboat racer is killed in a freak accident in front of...Teenage boy\u0027s severed arm REATTACHED thanks to his mom\u0027s...Share this articleIncredibly, a pensioner and his grandson who were in the car managed to escape with just a few scratches. The pair were reportedly able to exit the car by themselves and waited by the side of the road for the emergency services to arrive.           Lucky escape: The pair were reportedly able to exit the car by themselves and waited by the side of the road for the emergency services to arrive          Flattened: The VW was completely written off after being crushed by a passing tank in the city of Grodno, western Belarus          Cars were waiting at a red light when the tank swung around a corner at high speed and mounted a Volkswagen Polo          Road block: This was the scene after a giant Belarus war machine lost control, veered onto the other side of the road and crushed a VW Polo The driver, who has not been named, told local media: \u0027We were waiting, letting the military column pass, after they entered the road from a side road. \u0027After a few tanks passed by, one started sliding and crashed into my car.\u0027There has been no official statement from the military about the accident.           The driver, who has not been named, told local media: \u0027We were waiting, letting the military column pass, after they entered the road from a side road\u0027          There has been no official statement from the military about the accident, which happened in the city of Grodno, Belarus          Emergency services were called to the scene after a giant tank crushed a VW Polo.

She has remained a loving person and is always ready to help. She is not arrogant and despite all the success and fame, she still has got much love in her heart.\u0027There were so many friends and relatives in need and she never said no.\u0027I believe that success came to her because she is immensely hard-working. She achieved it solely on her own, without any nepotism.\u0027The woman who gave birth to the future catwalk queen at the age of 20 said Natalia grew up very quickly from the age of six when her sister Oksana, who suffers cerebral palsy and autism, was born. \u0027Maybe Natalia\u0027s success is a gift from above, because she alone took care of her disabled sister Oksana. Natasha was always there for Oksana. From the age of six she knew how to look after a child.\u0027Larisa orced her husband and has since re-married and had a third daughter Kristina, but she said the cornerstone of their fight for survival in impoverished conditions was the girl who would grow up to become a super star.\u0027I could leave the sisters to go to work, being sure that Natasha would do all the cooking and washing, as well as take care of the child.\u0027And I think that her love and hard work became the basis, which still helps her keep up.          Natalia\u0027s mum said despite her international background, having  married  an English man and now with a French man, her daughter is supporting her country to lift the trophy in Moscow          Natalia, pictured with three of her five children, is excited by her country\u0027s showing in the World Cup so far, her mother Larisa says. She added: \u0027We talked about the World Cup yesterday. She is amazed by the results of the Russian team\u0027  Natalia, pictured left in front of the Kremlin and right in Moscow, has used her global fame to help promote the World Cup \u0027Her friends would often mock her because of the disabled sister. They wouldn\u0027t want Oksana to hang out with them and Natasha would say \u0027We either go together or we don\u0027t go at all\u0027. You see a boomerang …everything returns to you.\u0027 The big sister left home when she reached 17 to pursue her dreams having seen her father walk out and being forced to sell berries from a barrow in freezing local markets to help her family. \u0027When she first left Russia at 17 she could not even speak English, and the modelling agency did not provide interpreters. She used to attend drama classes as a child, so she always knew how to present herself.\u0027But Natasha never finished school.  She didn\u0027t take her exams, so she has no high-school diploma. But we are proud of her. For me she is not a famous woman, not a star, but my daughter. I am overwhelmed with pride.\u0027In fact, knowing how hard-working and persistent she is, I understand how she has become so successful. When she has a goal, she strives for it and she never gives up.\u0027 Bidding her eldest daughter farewell as she took a plane from her hometown which was known as Gorky under Soviet Rule, she said she could never have dreamed her daughter would find world-wide fame.Natalia has modelled for Givenchy, Prada, Calvin Klein, Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Gucci as well as representing Stella McCartney, Hugo Boss and Gucci and H\u0026ampM.She has also been a cover star of magazines the world over and has received Vogue India\u0027s Women of The Year awards and had a doll made of her in Russia. \u0027I had no idea that she would become so famous. When she was leaving, I knew that it was the beginning of something big, but not that big,\u0027 said her mother.Larisa\u0027s home has an old 1990\u0027s-style TV and few mod cons in the kitchen, where a cupboard door is hanging from its hinges.On entering, the only clue that this is a family which has travelled is a fridge magnet of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, where Larisa visits her daughter twice a year.    Mummy\u0027s girl: Natalia\u0027s is close to her mother, Larisa, pictured. They talk on the phone every day and meet up at least twice a year either in  Russia or elsewhere depending on her schedule          Larisa, pictured with Natalia\u0027s grandmother also Larisa said: \u0027Unfortunately, we don\u0027t see each other often, because I can\u0027t leave Oksana. We meet about two times a year.          Natalia, pictured when she was five years old, grew up in a family struggling financially after her father walked out on her mother leaving her to bring up their daughters alone          Natalia\u0027s grandmother Larisa, pictured, gets to see her granddaughter more often as she goes to stay with her for several months at a time in Paris. Larisa added: She added: \u0027I visit her regularly and she is an extraordinary person. I say this not just because I am her grandmother\u0027She said: \u0027Unfortunately, we don\u0027t see each other often, because I can\u0027t leave Oksana. We meet about two times a year.\u0027We talk on the phone every day. Usually, we meet in Moscow or somewhere abroad. However, her grandmother travels more frequently. She flies to Paris a lot and stays there for a month or two.\u0027Her beaming grandmother said the model is always respectful and courteous and has not had her head turned by the star-status afforded her.She added: \u0027I visit her regularly and she is an extraordinary person. I say this not just because I am her grandmother.\u0027Her children are incredible too. Her eldest son Lucas always accompanies his mother. Her daughter Neva attends ballet classes. And her husband Antoine is also very nice. They dine together traditionally and the children are always engaged in the conversation.\u0027I really enjoy visiting them and my husband Viktor, who passed away 5 years ago, loved it too. The model has five children three with Justin Portman, 39, who is half-brother of the Viscount Portman, who she married in November 2001 and split from in 2011.She later began a relationship with Antoine Arnault, the CEO of mens\u0027 clothing brand Berluti. They have two sons Maxim, four, and two-year-old Roman. The catwalk queen is also an ambassador for the World Cup where four matches are being played in her city, including Sunday\u0027s match which saw England thrash Panama 6-1.           Family time: The model has five children three with Justin Portman, 39, who is half-brother of the Viscount Portman, and two sons from her current relationship with Antoine Arnault (pictured) CEO of mens\u0027 clothing brand Berluti But her mother said, despite her international background, marriage to a member of the English aristocracy and relationship with a French man, there was no doubt who her daughter was supporting to lift the trophy in Moscow in July.\u0027I think Natasha will support Russia. She always does. I am not sure though.\u0027Maybe she will also support France now, or maybe England. You know, three of her children are English, two are French, and she is a Russian, that is why it\u0027s hard to tell.\u0027We talked about the World Cup yesterday. She is amazed by the results of the Russian team.She added: \u0027There is a joke among Nizhny citizens, that we must thank god for the World Cup, as our city has finally been modernised.\u0027The area around the stadium used to be a horrible place. Now, I often go there to visit my friend, and when I first saw it I didn\u0027t recognise it.\u0027In our district now, most of the roads have been repaired. The government promised to fix the entire street. Many places were planted with trees.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/26/11/4DA4677600000578-5886745-image-a-13_1530009970806.jpg","title":"Helipads cinemas climbing walls private vineyards home Americas extreme home","story":"    Inspired from a scene from Arabian Nights is this five-bedroom property in Potomac, Maryland.

One of the many toilets inside Drakelow Tunnels that catered for workers inside the Rover factory during World War Two          Rover required acid-resistant floors and specially painted walls in production areas which sent the cost of the facility spiralling          In 1980, Drakelow was re-designated: Regional Government Headquarters 9.2. Tunnels were also upgraded and Blast Doors and Air Locks installed to bring the complex up to full Nuclear Bunker statusThe cost of the Drakelow Tunnels facility was estimated at £285,000. By early July 1942 work was well behind schedule and costs had risen to £983,000. Shortly before that date, the Rover car company was selected as the user of the factory.Rover were at the time manufacturing engines for the Bristol Aeroplane Company.The cost to complete the factory was estimated at a further £184,000 Rover\u0027s requirements included acid-resistant floors and specially painted walls in production areas.

The Hercules was fitted in the following aircraft: Bristol Beaufighter, Armstrong Whitworth Glider Tug, Handley Page Halifax Bomber, Saro Lerwick Flying Boat, Short Seaford Flying Boat, Short Stirling Bomber, Vickers Wellesley, Vickers Wellington Bomber and Avro Lancaster B.II Bomber. The Hercules was also used in military and civillian aircraft after the war. In 1961 the British Government converted half of the tunnels into a top secret facility, designated: Regional Seat of Government 9.

The president refused to exempt the European Union (including the UK), Canada and Mexico from steel and aluminium tariffs on imports from outside the US, while threatening $200bn (£151m) of additional tariffs on Chinese imports. The news rocked global stock markets as investors grow increasingly concerned over the actions, with the FTSE 100 losing more than 100 points in the past few weeks. Falling exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft contributed to Britain’s trade in goods deficit unexpectedly ballooning by £2bn to £14bn in April from the month earlier. Economists had forecast the gap between what Britain imports from the rest of the world and sells overseas would shrink slightly. Taking into account trade in UK services, as well as goods, over the three months to April, the total trade deficit widened by £1.9bn to £9.7bn. The UK’s dominant services sector expanded more quickly than expected in May, according to the most recent data published over the course of the last month, in a sign that Britain could have come through the worst of this year’s slowdown. The latest snapshot from the IHS MarkitCips UK Services PMI showed activity in the sector, which includes banks, restaurants and hotels, recovering to a three-month high. The construction and manufacturing sectors also recorded stronger-than-expected growth. Tax rises might be around the corner to fund Theresa May’s pledge to increase NHS spending by £20bn a year by 2024, yet the latest figures from the UK public finances show public sector borrowing falling further than expected. The budget deficit – the gap between income from tax and government spending – fell to £5bn in May from £7bn in the same month a year ago, beating economists’ forecasts. There was also a revision for the 2017-18 financial year by the Office for National Statistics, showing borrowing came in £1bn lower than previously thought.

Can the burgeoning Instagram- and tech-friendly tiny home movement help solve it?Ryann Flanagan is a teacher at a Montessori school in Austin, Texas. She’s 28 and living with her dad to save money while she looks for a place to buy, but “Austin is super expensive”, she says. Driving to work one day she admired a tiny model home tucked below a sprawling oak tree. A colleague recommended she contact James Stinson, the developer of Constellation ATX – a 6.2-acre tiny home community offering long-term leases on “micro-estates”. “In a micro-estate, you don’t just get your own little yard and your own little house, but you also get a community,” says Stinson. “We want to give people that are traditionally renters an option to come and put down some roots.”  Ostensibly in answer to this conundrum, tiny home communities – the term “tiny home” usually refers to a home of under 500 sq ft – are a growing presence in cities across the US. In Arizona, the Vail School District is building one for teachers who otherwise can’t afford to live in Vail, a community 25 miles southeast of Tucson where the median home price is $257,500. In the UK, construction of “micro-homes” smaller than 400 sq ft has more than doubled since 2010 – 8,000 were built in 2016, according to a Which? analysis of Land Registry data. Constellation ATX is the first US tiny home community to offer residents a 99-year leasehold estate, a sort of hybrid real estate that falls somewhere between renting and buying and overcomes a common problem associated with tiny homes – namely, where to put them. Austin and many other cities ban accessory dwelling units with wheels or require prohibitively expensive permitting. To ensure compliance, Constellation currently only allows houses from pre-approved suppliers, including Colorado-based Sprout Tiny Homes and Kasita, an Austin-based manufacturer of hi-tech tiny homes with price tags starting at $89,000 (about twice the average cost of a similarly sized traditional manufactured home). Stinson believes Constellation’s biggest selling point is the way it is integrating community into the development, which will include a pool and a 5,500 sq ft clubhouse, a communal kitchen and a rooftop patio. “People are moving to Austin from all over the world. A lot of them don’t know people,” he says. “This is a housing development that is focused around that socialisation aspect as well as the small house aspect.”This vision meshes with the reasons people give when they buy tiny homes – they want to eschew the material accumulation of things for something sparser and more focused on experiences rather than possessions. But are tiny homes a durable solution to the affordable-housing crisis, or are they a passing trend and simply making a virtue out of necessity? Even so, Shih says, Constellation’s monthly leasehold fees – starting at $725 – aren’t all that affordable: trailer parks at comparable distances to downtown Austin charge rents closer to $500 a month. But most tenants at trailer parks are on year-long leases. If the park owner decides to redevelop the land – or to raise rents to keep up with property tax increases – tenants have little option but to move, often at considerable cost. When Aaron Berman and his wife, Meredith, moved from Denver to Austin, they decided they wanted to live in a tiny home. “We wanted to get out of commercialism, of materialism,” says Berman. So they designed a tiny home and parked it in the backyard of the winery they owned. They loved living there, save for the constant threat of code enforcement – their tiny home was on wheels and prohibited by Austin’s zoning code. “We lived there for two years and then our daughter came along,” says Berman. “My wife said, ‘I can’t do this, I want a real place for her to grow up in.’” That’s precisely the concern of James Young, senior managing director at ARA Newmark in Austin. He’s considering developing a tiny home community on a 10-acre parcel of land he owns in south-west Austin after a young couple looking for a place to put their tiny home contacted him about his property. “What we learned is that people don’t currently own a tiny home, but they like the concept,” he says. But he thinks tiny homes are inherently transitional dwellings, where iniduals or couples live for three to five years while they save money. “I think it’s going to be handy for people who are looking for a short-term fix to affordability,” he says. “I don’t know how long the demand will last.”  The question remains: are tiny homes really all that affordable? Berman doesn’t think so. “It’s almost like buying an old car – financially it doesn’t make sense,” says Berman. “You’re talking about a lot of money, and you’re talking about a small market where you can resell it.” And like a car, a tiny home is a depreciating asset – research shows tiny homes don’t grow in value like traditional homes, in large part because they’re often not attached to land, the most valuable resource in a city like Austin. Kasita has built units made to be stacked as multifamily dwellings in low- to mid-rise developments on small plots of land, encouraging density in otherwise unaffordable areas. “We’re not going to solve the land issue,” acknowledges Jeff Wilson, the founder of Kasita. That question falls to local and state governments. Austin is currently rewriting its zoning code to encourage density, which could enable homeowners to put tiny homes in unused backyard spaces and rent them out, adding affordable units in desirable areas. The city is also considering putting a $300m housing bond on the ballot in November to fund affordable housing. Some activists would like the bond to fund public land acquisition for future affordable housing developments.For now, developers like Stinson have to build outside city limits, only exacerbating the city’s sprawl and crowded roads. Constellation itself is fairly dense, with 83 units on 6.2 acres (traditional single-family home developments are about half as dense, with four to 10 units per acre). “The problem with Austin and why it’s so expensive is because the development process takes so long that we could never actually catch up with the demand that’s moving here,” Stinson says.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e509ffffd177d41600b4b2f5e7b475d0de4b876e/0_447_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc4960c3226d4263f06b47dd46156e0c","title":"recline tilt seat air passenger","story":"Flying is nightmarish, but we’ve all got our little life-hacks that we use to make it bearable. Maybe you bring a neck pillow, splash out on noise-cancelling headphones, or import some melatonin to get over jetlag. My favourite tip is this: on a long-haul flight, I wait until the food is served, and then reach over to the tray of the person on my right, and take their dessert. The sugary goodness really improves my trip, and the thrill of taking something that isn’t mine is great. A lot of people get angry when I do this, but they’re just being unreasonable if they really care about dessert, they should just reach over and take one from the tray of the person on their right.Sure, there’s always some poor sod who’s on the far side of the plane who can’t steal anyone’s cake – and some lucky bastard who’s over on the other side and gets two – but if airlines didn’t want me to do it, why did they make the seats so close together in the first place?I kid, of course. Your sugar is safe around me – unless, that is, you recline your seat, grinding my knees, just so you can be 10 degrees closer to the horizontal for a flight in which you’re going to try to sleep for 20 minutes, and then give up and watch films you didn’t bother to see in the cinema first time around. If you do that, I will take your food, march to the exit row, and throw it out the door, in the hope that you’ll chase after it and have the full 36,000ft to realise your error.Reclining a seat is a zero-sum game. Any possible improvement in comfort you get comes at the expense of the person whose space you are stealing. And since planes have some seats that can’t recline– those against the bulkhead, or in front of the exit row – there will always be losers who can’t even recline their own seats to restore the equilibrium.It’s one of those minor sociopathies of modern life, like playing music on your phone’s loudspeakers or leaving the keyboard clicks on when you type out a text on the tube. But unlike those, crimes that any right-thinking person agrees demand retribution, seat-reclining is seen as a tolerable, even acceptable thing to do. One friend, a tall man with joint issues, had to politely ask the woman in front to return her seat to the upright position because she had, ever so slightly, dislocated his knee. Instead, she shouted at him until the flight attendant intervened.“But how can you sleep on the plane if you don’t recline your seat,” I am asked. Be honest: you can’t sleep on the plane whether or not you recline your seat. Moving the headrest of your chair 30cm into your fellow traveller’s personal space does not magically transform your ticket into a first-class seat with a lie-flat bed: it just screws up their trip.That’s particularly true if they’re a weirdo like me, who sleeps best on planes slumped forward on to the tray table – a position not physically possible if the seat in front is reclined, and one that feels actively dangerous to be doing while the seat reclines. If I die travelling, it won’t be because of a terror attack, it will be because someone forcefully shoved their chair back while I was sleeping and broke my neck.“If airlines didn’t want you to recline your seat, then why did they put a button on the armrest that lets you do just that,” my foes cry. Look, I’ll put aside the fact that you’re basing your standards of human behaviour on what an airline thinks is acceptable – the only corporations that would prefer it if they could just strip all their customers naked in the departure terminal, surprise them with chloroform, and ship them stacked in coffins to their destination – and admit that there are plenty of situations in which you can recline your seat.Maybe there’s no one behind you. Maybe there’s a child behind you. Maybe there’s reincarnated Hitler behind you, brought to life by someone sacrificing a frog over a pentagram made out of 4Chan memes and travelling to the US to begin a lucrative speaking tour about how his free speech is imperilled by campus no-platformers. In those situations, recline away. But if you are sat in front of a full-sized adult human being, then look them in the eye and ask yourself if you’re willing to take something from them just because you can. And if you are, maybe just steal a cookie from their tray while they’re not looking.• Alex Hern is a technology reporter for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af8a9ea282745afdc219cf51e99b4247f2f17e86/1606_101_3082_1849/master/3082.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25286d726b76f2ce2e4d643046e3e862","title":"1m teaching prize winner launches uk school arts charity","story":"“It’s right to give it back,” says Andria Zafirakou, as she recruits Simon Schama and Naughty Boy to her planAfter winning a $1m global teaching prize, Andria Zafirakou could have paid off her mortgage, bought a Ferrari and put her feet up for the rest of her life.Instead, the north London teacher has announced she is using the money she won in March with the Varkey Foundation global teacher prize – a kind of Nobel prize for teaching – to set up a campaigning charity to get more artists and arts organisations into Britain’s schools.Surrounded by pupils, teachers, family and supporters including Simon Schama, Melvyn Bragg, the musician Naughty Boy and the artist Mark Wallinger, Zafirakou launched her charity, Artists in Residence, at her place of work for the past 12 years, Alperton community school in Brent, and said she wanted to bring about a classroom revolution. “This is our time, this is the time for the arts, we are going to make a change and do something quite incredible,” she said. “I knew what I had to do, I had to start a mission, a crusade, to help fix a mess, to raise the profile of arts in our schools.”The campaign stems from the difficulties many schools have in getting artists of any sort – whether an up-and-coming local musician or a major movie star – into schools to work with and inspire children.Zafirakou’s charity will essentially be a broker between schools and artists. “I get schools, I know the problems they have and I know the language of schools,” she said. “I know that many artists cannot get into schools because of logistical problems.”The project will begin as a pilot involving 30 schools in disadvantaged communities, before widening to the whole of London and then rolling out to the rest of the UK in 2019.Many will see it as an extraordinary act of altruism given there were no obligations attached to the prize money. “If this was the lottery it would have been a different situation, but it’s not the lottery,” Zafirakou said. “This is something I won because I’m a teacher so it’s right to give it back to the profession.”She said she felt her award recognised the importance of arts education in schools and society. “When you have kids who are not picking up arts because they do not know what the jobs are or don’t realise the value of it, that’s when alarm bells ring and you have to do something.”Schama, a professor of art history at Columbia University in the US, said Zafirakou was a force of nature and he was happy to be an artist-in-residence at Alperton. “When you have been dealing for a very long time with precociously over-educated graduate students, it’s fantastically thrilling to come to a school like this.”He said it was a mistake to see arts and music in schools as a luxury or an add-on. “It is an indispensable centre. What will remain of us when AI takes over will be our creativity, and it is our creative spirit, our visionary sense of freshness, which has been Britain’s strength for centuries.”He said the arts were particularly important at what he described as the start of a new age, “the beginning of an explosion of digital visual creativity”.Schama added: “At the moment huge grey tidal flows of money from Russia, China and the Middle East are flowing in to what will soon be the archaic world of dealers and art advisers. Very soon it will not be that.”Zafirakou hopes to sign up an army of artists and arts organisations who will work with schools for fixed periods, whether a day or a full academic year.She said subjects such as art, music and drama were being squeezed out of the curriculum at a time when they had never been more important. “They’re not only essential for personal growth and self-understanding but they also teach young people to think creatively, learn to communicate effectively and build resilience. All these skills will be important for the jobs that they are likely to do when they leave school.”Lord Bragg said: “The curious thing, and it has baffled me for years, is that the only people in the country who don’t get it are the politicians. I go the theatre quite a bit and I never see a politician … I wonder if they read books.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9a86ddf2b76c7913394523f7c0b4db3569c225f/158_382_1321_792/master/1321.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfbd8c6647c5cde81830ced1c71277d9","title":"rising seas florida climate change elizabeth rush","story":"Sea level rises are not some distant threat for many Americans they are very real. In an extract from her chilling new book, Rising, Elizabeth Rush details how the US coastline will be radically transformed in the coming yearsIn 1890, just over six thousand people lived in the damp lowlands of south Florida. Since then the wetlands that covered half the state have been largely drained, strip malls have replaced Seminole camps, and the population has increased a thousandfold. Over roughly the same amount of time the number of black college degree holders in the United States also increased a thousandfold, as did the speed at which we fly, the combined carbon emissions of the Middle East, and the entire population of Thailand.A teenager, wrists lined in aquamarine beaded bracelets, rubs sleep from her eyes. Returns her head to its resting position in her palm. The man seated behind me roots around in his briefcase for a breakfast bar. No one raises a hand.“In the ocean,” Hal continues. “That heat is expanding the ocean, which is contributing to sea level rise, and it is also, more importantly, creating the setting for something we really don’t want to have happen: rapid melt of ice.”A woman wearing a sequined teal top opens her Five Star notebook and starts writing things down. The guy behind her shovels spoonfuls of passionfruit–flavored Chobani yogurt into his tiny mouth. Hal’s three sons are perched in the next row back. One has a ponytail, one is in a suit, and the third crosses and uncrosses his gray street sneakers. The one with the ponytail brought a water bottle the other two sip Starbucks. And behind the rows and rows of sparsely occupied seats, at the very back of the amphitheater, an older woman with a gold brocade bear on her top paces back and forth.A real estate developer interrupts Hal to ask: “Is someone recording this?”“Yes.” The cameraman coughs. “Besides,” Hal adds, “I say the same damn thing at least five times a week.” Hal, who is in his early seventies and has been studying sea level rise for over 40 years, pulls at his Burt Reynolds moustache, readjusts his taupe corduroy suit, and continues. On the screen above his head clips from a documentary on climate change show glacial tongues of ice the size of Manhattan tumbling into the sea. “The big story in Greenland and Antarctica is that the warming ocean is working its way in, deep under the ice sheets, causing the ice to collapse faster than anyone predicted, which in turn will cause sea levels to rise faster than anyone predicted.”According to Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, rising sea levels are uncertain, their connection to human activity tenuous. And yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects roughly two feet of rise by century’s end. The United Nations predicts three feet. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates an upper limit of six and a half feet.Take the 6 million people who live in south Florida today and ide them into two groups: those who live less than six and a half feet above the current high tide line, and everybody else. The numbers slice nearly evenly. Heads or tails: call it in the air. If you live here, all you can do is hope that when you put down roots your choice was somehow prophetic.But Hal says it doesn’t matter whether you live six feet above sea level or sixty-five, because he, like James Hansen, believes that all of these predictions are, to put it mildly, very, very low. “The rate of sea level rise is currently doubling every seven years, and if it were to continue in this manner, Ponzi scheme style, we would have 205 feet of sea level rise by 2095,” he says. “And while I don’t think we are going to get that much water by the end of the century, I do think we have to take seriously the possibility that we could have something like 15 feet by then.”It’s a little after nine o’clock. Hal’s sons stop sipping their lattes and the oceanographic scientist behind me puts down his handful of M\u0026ampM’s. If Hal Wanless is right, every single object I have seen over the past 72 hours – the periodic table of elements hanging above his left shoulder, the buffet currently loaded with refreshments, the smoothie stand at my seaside hotel, the beach umbrellas and oxygen bars, the Johnny Rockets and seashell shop, the lecture hall with its hundreds of mostly empty teal swivel chairs – will all be underwater in the not-so-distant future.One of the few stories I remember from the Bible vividly depicts the natural and social world in crisis. It is the apocalyptic narrative par excellence – Noah’s flood. When I look it up again, however, I am surprised to find that it does not start with a rainstorm or an ark, but earlier, with unprecedented population growth and God’s scorn. It begins: “When human beings began to increase in number on the earth.” I read this line and think about the 6,000 inhabitants of south Florida turning into 6 million in 120 short years. “The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become.” I think about the exponential increase in M\u0026ampM’s, Chobani yogurt cups and grande lattes consumed over that same  of time. The dizzying supply chains, cheap labor and indestructible plastic. “So God said to Noah, ‘I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them.’” And then the rain began.I do not believe in a vengeful God – if God exists at all – so I do not think of the flood as punishment for human sin. What interests me most is what happens to the story when I remove it from its religious framework: Noah’s flood is one of the most fully developed accounts of environmental change in ancient history. It tries to make sense of a cataclysmic earthbound event that happened long ago, before written language, before the domestication of horses, before the first Egyptian mummies and the rise of civilization in Crete. An event for which the teller clearly held humans responsible.Dig into geologic history and you discover this: when sea levels have risen in the past, they have usually not done so gradually, but rather in rapid surges, jumping as much as 50 feet over a short three centuries. Scientists call these events “meltwater pulses” because the near-biblical rise in the height of the ocean is directly correlated to the melting of ice and the process of deglaciation, the very events featured in the documentary footage Hal has got running on a screen above his head.He shows us a clip of the largest glacial calving event ever recorded. It starts with a chunk of ice the size of Miami’s tallest building tumbling, head over tail, off the tip of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Then the Southeast Financial Center goes, displaying its cool blue underbelly. It is a coltish thing, smooth and oddly muscular. The ground between the two turns to arctic ice dust and the ocean roils up. Next, chunks of ice the size of the Marquis Residences crash away then the Wells Fargo Center falls, and with it goes 900 Biscayne Bay. Suddenly everything between the Brickell neighborhood and Park West is gone.The clip begins again and I watch in awe as a section of the Jakobshavn Glacier half the size of all Miami falls into the sea.“Greenland is currently calving chunks of ice so massive they produce earthquakes up to six and seven on the Richter scale,” Hal says as the city of ice breaks apart. “There was not much noticeable ice melt before the nineties. But now it accelerates every year, exceeding all predictions. It will likely cause a pulse of meltwater into the oceans.”In medicine, a pulse is something regular – a predictable throb of blood through veins, produced by a beating heart. It is so reliable, so steady, so definite that lack of a pulse is sometimes considered synonymous with death. A healthy adult will have a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute, every day, until they don’t. But a meltwater pulse is the opposite. It is an anomaly. The exception to the 15,000-year rule.From 1900 to 2000 the glacier on the screen retreated inward eight miles. From 2001 to 2010 it pulled back nine more over a single decade the Jakobshavn glacier lost more ice than it had during the previous century. And then there is this film clip, recorded over 70 minutes, in which the glacier retreats a full mile across a calving face three miles wide. “This is why I believe we are witnessing the beginning of the largest meltwater pulse in modern human history,” Hal says.As the ice sheets above Hal’s head fall away and the snacks on the buffet disappear, topography is transformed from a backwater physical science into the single most important factor determining the longevity of the Sunshine State. The man seated next to me leans over. “If what he says is even half true,” he whispers, “Florida is about to be wiped off the map.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1581a86fbefcae9adb1586fe87c075bb7a73bb8f/0_213_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8837aa28f186b24489d791744a868dc","title":"red deer isle rum scotland in pictures","story":"A team of six scientists has descended on Rum, a small island in the Inner Hebrides on the west coast of Scotland, to catch red deer calves.

But this season it has been given multiple seals of approval by the fashion pack, and is naturally (ooh!) the perfect fabric in which to style out hot and sticky weather. It can also bridge the gap between smart and casual: Albus Lumen’s zip-detailed shirt is meeting-approved chic, while Raey’s beige button-front skirt is a great example of a piece that can be dressed up or down. SCIt’s not impossible to wear white in winter. But it can feel a little challenging on the psyche. The LWD is short, usually cotton or linen, and usually comes with a little twist (a little broderie-anglaise, a little embroidery). If the little black dress is sexy, then the short white dress is more … prairie? Our money’s on the laced-back cotton dress by Rebecca Taylor or – outsider choice – a nightie by Pour Les Femmes worn as a dayie. As dresses go, it’s not staggeringly practical, so wear something around your waist on the bus to avoid marks. MFFor the past few summers, slides have dominated the high street. Understandably so: they are ideal for the heat, to throw on, or wear with socks. Still, they remain absolute hell for people who want their feet to look elegant. Thankfully, a new strain has emerged that barely look like slides, while still definitely being slides. These include leather ones in lilac from Zara, woven ones from Topshop, pebble-friendly ones from Ancient Greek sandals or the ultimate ones: souped-up hotel slippers from Balenciaga. Happy feet etc. MFKeeping things straightforward is central to successful heatwave dressing, which is why the jumpsuit has pull-on-and-go appeal. Luckily, they are everywhere this season: on the high-street, Asos and Mango both have great styles that are appropriate for work, weekends and weddings, while Norma Kamali at Net-a-Porter has excellent evening options. The main thing is to choose a thin and lightweight or breathable fabric so that you airily saunter, rather than awkwardly squeak, down the street.

It was time, according to the manager, to “get the music on and have a couple of beers”.Only a couple, mind. Zaliv, the one nightclub in Repino, is open late only on Fridays and Saturdays and not, perhaps, a typical haunt for England’s players, given Frankie Boyle’s description of it on his BBC documentary before the tournament as “last orders at your cousin’s wedding”.The team chose instead to stay at their hotel, toasting their early qualification for the last 16. And why not when they are even getting praise, of sorts, from an old enemy? “It is time for all of Scotland to be afraid,” according to the Daily Record, which noted England would regret it for ever if Southgate – “a bit of a dry lunch, but so what?” – did not get his hands on the “big lump of glorious gold almost winking in their direction, beckoning them to step forward and claim it for their own”.At which point it is probably worth reiterating that England’s victories so far have come against moderate sides and, to be picky, that Southgate’s men have not managed a clean sheet in either match, with some legitimate misgivings about how they might cope at the back against more efficient opponents.England can certainly be emboldened by the fact they have won their opening two fixtures for only the third time since 1950, that the team are playing with energy and effervescence and that Kane, in particular, seems absolutely determined to leave his mark on this tournament.Kane’s five-goal haul against Tunisia and Panama would already have been enough to win the Golden Boot outright in 1962 and jointly with Miroslav Klose in 2006 and Thomas Müller in 2010. He is one short of Mario Kempes’s winning total in 1978, Paolo Rossi in 1982, Gary Lineker in 1986, Totò Schillaci in 1990, Hristo Stoichkov and Oleg Salenko in 1994 and Davor Suker in 1998. Kane gives the impression he is as driven by these awards as Cristiano Ronaldo, so much so that Southgate wondered whether his captain might “have the hump” for being substituted against Panama. For Kane, it is almost an obsession to see his name at the top of the scoring charts.All of which might warrant a delicate conversation if Southgate, as he appears to be leaning, has any plans to leave Kane out of the match against Belgium on Thursday that will determine which of the two teams, both already qualified, goes through as Group G winners.That suggests Southgate is contemplating keeping him back for England’s first knockout tie, either in Rostov on Monday or Moscow the following day. Kane, of course, has let it be known he does not want a rest. Yet Southgate has also said that his priority is to look after some of the players who have not featured so far and, more than once, he has mentioned “the harmony” of the group. Steven Gerrard once referred to the England camp as a “five-star prison” and, behind the gates of the team hotel, Southgate is aware of the potential for the non-playing members of his squad to start feeling down and that, in turn, to create problems.Belgium will definitely make widespread changes, with Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku among the players expected to be rested, and in Southgate’s case there are four outfield players – Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Gary Cahill and Trent Alexander-Arnold – who have not played a single minute. Dele Alli hopes to be fit again and Kieran Trippier will be closely monitored after being substituted, as a precaution, against Panama.By the time the game kicks off, England will also have a much better idea of the pros and cons of finishing first or second and the best route to avoid a potential quarter-final showdown with Germany or Brazil. It may work out better in the long run to go through as runners-up in a group where England and Belgium are currently separated only by their bookings count. Nobody, however, should believe England, currently top, will go to Kaliningrad with the specific intention of surrendering that position.“For our country, that would be a very difficult mindset to have,” Southgate said. “We want to win every game of football we go into. I don’t know how we would go into a game not wanting to win and play well, so I think that’s dangerous territory if we start trying to plot and predict where we might end up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/711fb1d093bc33b17020e606d55cf1e32c025ae6/0_220_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0223edc10261c9a3f7219754a09c4a4","title":"danny ings exit liverpool summer injury blighted time anfield","story":"Danny Ings has taken the difficult decision to seek a move away from Liverpool this summer as he aims to relaunch a career that has been blighted by injuries throughout his time at Anfield.There is no real desire within the club’s hierarchy to part company with a striker who has become a useful squad player under Jürgen Klopp, but the 25-year-old craves regular first-team football and recognises he will struggle for game-time on Merseyside. He will depart with Liverpool’s blessing.Ings’s desire to prove himself under Klopp had seen him reject prospective moves in each of the last three transfer windows in which he has been fit and available for selection, with interest having been expressed by Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham, as well as his former clubs Burnley and Bournemouth.There will be suitors from Premier League clubs this time round too but, intriguingly, interest also from abroad. Internazionale are believed to be monitoring his situation, while a trio of Bundlesiga clubs – RB Leipzig, Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen – could also formalise their pursuit of his services. Ings will depart reluctantly, but retains ambitions to prove himself at the highest level and a desire to regain a place in the England setup. It is a sign of the strength of the relationship between player and manager that Liverpool are unlikely to price him out of a move away.The £6.5m signing from Burnley has seen his time at Anfield horribly interrupted by two serious knee injuries, but he recovered sufficiently to make 14 appearances last term for the Champions League finalists, scoring once in a 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion in April. He has worked extensively with a personal trainer over the current closed season to ensure he will be fit and ready for the new season – Liverpool actually return to pre-season training next Monday – and has two years to run on his current contract.Ings was capped by England, under Roy Hodgson, against Lithuania in October 2015 before damaging his anterior cruciate ligaments in Klopp’s first training session as Liverpool manager. He suffered a further ligament injury at the start of the 2016-17 season and, as a result, did not actually start a Premier League game between October 2015 and April 2018.Yet his desire to force a way into contention at a club boasting mouth-watering attacking options saw him reject chances to leave where others, including Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi, sought loan moves to rekindle their careers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9e095240902644450d47f23bcd9e8d38257a779/0_69_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da886256c49dddd4c54b1b136db4bce9","title":"jorge sampaoli argentina world cup back on track","story":"• Coach says he has been made to feel like a ‘criminal’ • Lionel Messi’s mother reveals he cried after Croatia defeatAfter five days of soul-searching that has seen everyone from Diego Maradona to Lionel Messi’s mother have their say on where it has gone wrong so far for their team, it was left to Jorge Sampaoli to put things in perspective on Monday. “The week was difficult after the defeat,” the coach admitted. “Tomorrow the World Cup starts for Argentina.”Yet, if you had believed the reports, the man who led Chile to the Copa América in 2015 might not have even been in charge as his side prepare to face Nigeria in St Petersburg knowing that only a victory can keep alive their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages.Speculation that Sampaoli had been sacked in the early hours of the morning after the devastating 3-0 defeat to Croatia – and that players had demanded Jorge Burruchaga, the general manager and a 1986 World Cup winner, should take over – were angrily dismissed by their FA’s president, Claudio Tapia, who accused the media of “hurting the national team”.Javier Mascherano also attempted to defuse any suggestion that they had demanded Sampaoli ditch his favoured three-man defence in an attempt to improve the service to Lionel Messi, who has yet to score in Russia. “The relationship with the coach is totally normal,” he said on Monday. “Obviously, when we feel some discomfort or we see something, we express it to him because otherwise we would be hypocrites.”Unlike for the opening draw against Iceland and the loss to Croatia, however, Sampaoli decided against revealing his hand 24 hours before kick-off, claiming he had yet to inform the players of his team but that it is “in his head”.“The way the match was structured against Croatia didn’t suit Messi,” the coach said. “We’ll try to make it better and hope that he will be able to receive the ball a lot more.”Maradona, who coached Argentina to the quarter-finals in 2010, has been among Sampaoli’s chief critics this week, accusing the 58-year-old of “lacking a plan”, but also blaming Tapia for a failure to plan ahead that has seen the country’s previously all-conquering youth sides fail to qualify for several recent major tournaments.While Messi escaped his ire, the captain’s mother also revealed in an interview with Argentinian television that her son “suffered and cried” after the Croatia defeat. “His dream is to win a World Cup. It’s what he wants the most,” said Celia Cuccittini.His 31st birthday on Sunday was marked by a peck on the cheek and a pat on the back from Sampaoli before training, amid reports he had been one of the instigators of the revolt, while down the road in Bronnitsy – a small town 30 miles to the southeast of Moscow that is Argentina’s base in Russia – there was another celebration going on. Known as the farthest point of Napoleon’s advance after the fall of Moscow in 1812, local residents arranged a party in honour of the Barcelona forward that featured a 60 kilogram life-size chocolate sculpture of their hero as its centrepiece. A team of five workers at had worked for nearly a week to produce it before being distributed among supporters.In response to the rumours about his position, Sampaoli said: “The week went from low to high, and with respect to what was said, I cannot clarify things that did not exist. They make you feel like a criminal because you lost a game.”He has a contract until 2022 and with the Argentina FA in severe financial difficulties, would usually expect to lose his job if they are eliminated. But against a resurgent Nigeria – who in November beat Argentina 4-2 in Krasnodar – they face a difficult task. “The two teams are going to try their best to qualify, which makes it a very attractive match,” Sampaoli added. “I am convinced that we have a big opportunity to make it through.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92b51f2bf635eed8c131cd1031d74bcf0b756e35/0_85_3011_1807/master/3011.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b1f75c65b33f86a07ed28df8fbbcd78","title":"world cup best game argentina romania usa 94 hagi","story":"Every football fan will have their own favourite World Cup game but this five-goal thriller takes some beatingBy Craig McCracken for Beyond The Last ManAsk a thousand football fans about the greatest match of their lifetimes and be ready for a thousand different responses – none of them the right one. There’s really only one sensible and rational answer. This particular accolade should belong, unequivocally, to the last-16 game played at the 1994 World Cup between Romania and Argentina. Here’s why you should think so too.Let’s start with the nuts and bolts behind a remarkable game played at an unremarkable stage of the competition. Romania had qualified for the knockout stages by topping their group and catching the eye with their dazzlingly telepathic counter-attacking play. By contrast Argentina had just squeezed through by the skin of their teeth as a third-place qualifier, yet still approached this tie as favourites thanks to their historical pedigree and heavyweight reputation.The billing of the game as Maradona v the Maradona of the Carpathians (as Gheorghe Hagi was known in certain quarters) lost one of its headline acts three days before the fixture in Pasadena when Diego was expelled from the tournament after testing positive for banned stimulants. Claudio Caniggia was also unavailable, but Argentina could still name an enviable makeshift attack that featured the brilliant Serie A-based pairing of Gabriel Batistuta and Abel Balbo.Romania coach Anghel Iordanescu had selection headaches too. He chose to replace suspended forward Florin Raducioiu with the deeper-lying Ilie Dumitrescu, scorer of nine goals in his previous eight internationals. This would prove an inspired move and an early example of a false nine tactic in action. After 11 minutes, Dumitrescu’s curling free-kick from near the touchline deceived Argentina keeper Islas and flew in to the goal, replicating a goal scored by Hagi against Colombia in the group stage.Batistuta equalised with a penalty five minutes later, but Romania regained the lead within two minutes when Dumitrescu cut through the middle, released Hagi on the right and carried on his run to meet the perceptive return pass and side-foot home at the near post. Only a desperate goal-line clearance by Caceres stopped Dumitrescu from completing a first-half hat-trick after another brilliant counter-attack.Romania did extend their lead in the second half around the hour mark, when Selymes broke down the left and squared the ball to Dumitrescu who flicked it into the path of Hagi. The talismanic forward scored with a glorious rising shot to make it 3-1. Argentina attacked desperately and pulled a goal back on 75 minutes when Prunea couldn’t hold a Diego Simeone drive and Balbo fired home the rebound. Romania survived a frantic ending and held out for a famous win that them further in the World Cup than they had ever been.Five goals, world-class footballers at their peak and a match in the balance right until the final whistle suggest this was a thriller, but they don’t necessarily scream out classic of our times. So what marks out this particular fixture as one that transcends all others? The incredible pace and intensity of the game despite the blisteringly hot conditions, the exceptional technical quality on display from both sides and the fascinating tactical battle between two canny managers who were employing radically different styles.Argentina adopted a tight and compact 4-4-2 system with the ball moved quickly and accurately by Redondo, Simeone and Ariel Ortega into positions for strikers Batistuta and Balbo to explode into life. Romania adopted a formation akin to a 4-6-0, outnumbering Argentina in midfield and swarming forward on the counter-attack when they won back the ball, swapping positions and bewildering defenders with their movement. This was a perfect storm of two teams coming together to create 90 minutes of utterly sublime and mesmerising football: a compelling nexus of pace, intelligence, exemplary technique and tactical execution.These were the two best team performances during the entire 1994 World Cup and sadly it meant that one team had to return home at an unduly early stage. Iordanescu was clear about what the performance and result meant for Romania: “This is the greatest event celebrated by our people since the revolution. It’s also the greatest moment in our soccer history.”Maradona, by now working as a commentator for Argentinian television, was unable to see past the pain of early elimination and his own paranoia. “Romania didn’t beat us on the pitch,” he said. “We were beaten off the pitch and that’s what hurts.” Let’s hope that in his quieter, more reflective moments Maradona now realises that there was no disgrace in narrowly losing out in this most epic of football matches.• This article appeared first on Beyond The Last Man• Follow Craig McCracken on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1649f779ff303cbe6db9bf3f9b511bddbb74b7c6/0_95_2852_1711/master/2852.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54ccf4bba000c7dea914e64c207ea2f7","title":"australia v peru world cup 2018 live socceroos","story":"34 min: How do Australia not score!?

That looked for all money like the equaliser.32 min: Australia work a decent sight of goal but the flag’s up for offside. Rogic again to the fore. 29 min: “I realise homerism is universal,” writes John Ashdown, “but wasn’t there a touch of arrogance from the Australian media, with all the focus on whether Denmark and France would fix their game, and tie-breaking criteria and so on Always seemed to me that the hard part would be what the Australians were taking for granted - beating a very good Peru squad.” Absolutely, but as you suggest, that’s the case all over the world I think.27 min: Magical from Tom Rogic, dancing like George Best in San Jose between a stack of Peruvian defenders and into the penalty area but his shot is saved well by Gallese. The resulting corner is claimed confidently by Peru’s keeper. That was a glimpse of how brilliant Rogic can be. Prodigious talent. 25 min: Half-chance for Peru from a set-piece. Cueva chips a neat ball through for his skipper but Guerrero can only flick his header tamely into Mat Ryan’s gloves. After his assist I wonder if Australia are regretting lobbying for Guerrero to feature in Russia following his suspension for a doping violation.23 min: “How times have changed,” emails David Seare. “Peru notch a wonderful South American finish, full of mystery and wonder. Commentator - “what a volley from the Watford man”. How times have changed since I was a boy in 1978 watching Peru charm the world.”21 min: Australia straight back on the attack, and again it’s down the left with the overlapping Behich crossing for Leckie to miscue a header over the bar. 20 min: Australia complaining there could have been an offside in the build up to the goal, but VAR was not activated. Mountain to climb now for the Socceroos. Wallop! Out of nowhere Peru take the lead. Long ball for Guerrero that the skipper does well to chase down and then cross for Carrillo to smash home on the volley from the edge of the box. Nothing Mat Ryan could do with that. Peru’s first goal of Russia 2018 is a belter.17 min: A familiar tale so far for Australia, good signs but no clear chances.15 min: Patient phase of possession for Australia, circulating the ball in front of Peru’s defence, looking to lull their opponents into a false sense of security before lofting a vertical pass to the overlapping runner. In this instance it was Kruse but his cross is cleared.13 min: Australia probing nicely all over the field. Rogic and Behich both have speculative shots charged down. Peru have not got going yet.11 min: Peru have tried a couple of long diagonal balls from left to right to isolate Behich defensively but the execution has yet to come off. It will be interesting to note if Van Marwijk trusts his fullback to deal with that threat on his own or whether he requires support. 9 min: Australia have definitely settled the better of the two sides and they’re trying to keep the tempo high when they’re in possession. They break again, this time down the left, but Behich’s cross is cleared. From that clearance Jedinak picks up an early booking for a high boot in midfield on Cueva.7 min: Decent opening for Australia down the right. Rogic finding space between the lines, feeding Juric on the shoulder of his centre-half but his cross is taken by the keeper before it could reach Kruse.6 min: Australia’s forwards are hunting in packs, led by Juric, swarming all over Peru’s defenders when the ball’s in dispute. Peru are taking no chances, drilling the ball long when nothing’s on nearby.For most of the 15,000-odd Socceroos fans to make the journey to Russia, today is the end of the road. Indeed, it seems as if numbers are already lower here than they were in Kazan and Samara. Nick from Perth told me he flies home in less than 24 hours, and even Australia qualify for the round of 16 he’s unlikely to be able to stick around. Only the fortunate are staying in Russia come what may. Let’s hope the Socceroos give the rest a reason to at least consult Skyscannertheir travel agent about flight changes...4 min: One thing to note from an Australian perspective this World Cup has been Aaron Mooy’s ability to break up play in midfield. Noted as a ball-player he’s also been an outstanding destroyer in Russia. Still no chances for either side. Tomi Juric has worked hard to get into the game early.2 min: The pattern of the match could well have been set in the opening two minutes. Peru dominating possession but it’s laboured and lacking penetration. Australia bide their time and then snatch the turnover in midfield and break at pace. Nothing comes of the counterattack down the left but you can see the Van Marwijk imprimatur.Here we go then, 90 minutes to decide Australia’s World Cup fate.Deary me, it sounds deafening in Sochi, the noise peaking as the Peruvian anthem draws to a close. They will be missed, La Blanquirroja. Peru are lining up for the anthems in long sleeve warm-up tops. Baller move in this heat and humidity.Edging towards kick-off here in Sochi. The players are gathering in the tunnel and big flags are fluttering out on the turf. Australia will be top to toe in gold on the black sea. Peru will be in their away kit of all red with a rakish white sash sweeping across their jersey.Meanwhile, over in Moscow...Mile Jedinak bagged a hat-trick in the match that sent Australia to Russia 2018, another one agains Peru would see the bearded Villain join Harry Kane at the front in the race for the Golden Boot.This is nice. Although Australian supporters will be hoping Paolo Guerrero doesn’t put Peru on the map tonight (boom tish, try the veal, etc and so on...).Another Australia World Cup match, another rendition of Down Under. I hope Men at Work are getting decent royalties. Peru colours currently outnumbering the green and gold within the Fisht Stadium - let’s hope reinforcements are outside. I spoke to some Peruvians yesterday and they’ve had a lovely time in Russia. A win - or even a goal (they are yet to score at this Word Cup) - would mean the world to them.Great to check in with the all-knowing Andy Howe. As I found out recently, he is an ornament to Australian football.In case you’ve not been doing the internet properly over the past couple of days, not only does Australia play football, it also has kangaroos. You can guess the rest.“If Australia go out tonight, do you reckon this is the last time we ever see Tim Cahill on a football pitch or will some A-League team swoop in to give the legend a proper send-off?” Great question, Josh Britton.It would certainly be the perfect moment for him to bow out. He’s without a club, barely featured last season, and there’s nothing else for him to target (although he may want another crack at the Asian Cup in January). It could be a bit off-Broadway if you know what I mean though. If tonight is his last meaningful game I would expect a farewell testimonial of sorts further down the line that allows EvertonMillwallSocceroos fans a chance to say farewell. Your referee for tonight’s match is Russian Sergei Karasev and his retinue is as follows:Australia’s PFA has an excellent social media presence as exemplified by these neat little scouting clips of Peru.It’s a hot and humid day here in Sochi. The Fisht Stadium is right by the shores of the Black Sea, and only a few kilometres from Russia’s border with Abkhazia - a separatist, partially-recognised state claimed by Georgia. Sochi is a rather misleading label for this arena - it is situated within the Olympic Park, 10 minutes’ drive from Adler, a modest-sized town, and about 35 klicks from Sochi itself. The main Australian fan groups are staying in Sochi proper, while the Peruvians seem to have camped out in Adler and the stadium’s surrounds.“Evening Jonathan,” evening Andrew James. “Like probably quite a few of your readers I managed two hours sleep last night, dozing after Suarez put Uruguay ahead and then going straight through from Spain v Morocco until now. Any tips on how to stay awake on minimal sleep? Ps: Argentina at 4am is still tempting.”Sweets. Lots and lots of sweets. My shape du jour is dinosaur but snakes do a similar job. How’s this for a little bit of history repeating itself?... and the result of France vs. Denmark in 1998? 2-1 to Les Bleus, which would do very nicely for the Socceroos tonight if that remarkable series of coincidences continued.Addendum: If in the unlikely event of lots being drawn, there will be a ceremony at a press centre in Moscow shortly after full-time. If that happens, my eyeballs will look like something from Ren \u0026amp Stimpy.What we know“Good morning or night!” It’s night for me, Matt McCluskey (a surname I’m sure you’re reminded of often has deep Grange Hill roots in the memories of 30-somethings like me). “When Australia gets its next penalty, do you think Jedinak slides it bottom right corner again? So far so good with that strategy.”Like the skipper’s beard, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. “Evening Jonathan,” evening Martin Turnbull. “If Tomi Juric is the answer, it must be a dastardly strange question.” A little harsh I think but understandable considering the lack of goals recently for either Australia or FC Luzern. But he was expected to be Australia’s line-leading no.9 ahead of the World Cup before an injury during the round of pre-tournament friendlies opened the door for Andrew Nabbout. He has earned his chance and despite the cases of Cahill and Arzani he’s the sensible choice.Two changes for Peru with Anderson Santamaria replacing Alberto Rodriguez in defence and Renato Tapia coming in for Pedro Aquino in midfield.Peru were also forced to discount Jefferson Farfan after the Lokomotiv Moscow forward suffered a “traumatic brain injury” on Saturday. Farfan was apparently knocked unconscious for a couple of minutes after colliding with a team-mate.Since Andrew Nabbout went down clutching his shoulder late on in the match against Denmark there has been fevered debate across Australia about who his replacement up front should be. Tomi Juric has been given the nod and his inclusion is the only change to the side that’s started the previous two matches. Bert van Marwijk is nothing if not consistent. “I always start with the players who have the best chance of a result.” he told Australian TV a short while ago.Of the other selection considerations, Robbie Kruse is perhaps fortunate to retain his place on the left wing, while Tim Cahill and Daniel Arzani have once again been overlooked despite varying degrees of public clamour for their inclusions. The calls for Cahill to start from some sections of the Australia media were, frankly embarrassing. You can keep up with all the action in Moscow with Barry Glendenning. He will be sure to report if the fix is in.I think Australian supporters have to be prepared for a draw in Moscow. After all, it wouldn’t be the first time such a thing has occurred at a World Cup.Any toey Australian fans out there? Ease the tension with a nice steaming hot mug of Squires.Kieran Pender sets the scene from an Australian perspective. “The odds are against them, but the Socceroos are hoping that results in Sochi and Moscow on Tuesday will give them another World Cup evening to remember.”Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of this vital Group C encounter between Australia and Peru in Sochi. Depending on the progress of France vs. Denmark in Moscow we could be in for a complicated few hours, but for now let’s stick with the headline: Australia must win to remain in the World Cup.Peru are already out, unfortunately. Consecutive defeats mean this will be the final opportunity of Russia 2018 to enjoy arguably the best set of travelling fans at the tournament, and one of the iconic international football kits.All eyes on Australia then, who will take the lion’s share of the focus of this minute-by-minute as we figure out if they can secure the result required and for France to do them a favour to seal the deal. To add to the Antipodean flavour, I’m mashing the keystrokes from Melbourne, where it is already an ungodly hour and only going to get worse. Apologies in advance if some entries after half-time just read zzzzzzzzzz.Kick off is 5pm local time (midnight in Australia and 3pm in the UK). Considering my need to fight the urge to succumb to sleep’s soft embrace, your correspondence is needed more than ever.

Wide. 32 min: Having seen a couple of replays of that incident involving Hernandez, Mandanda and Eriksen, I’m still not sure whether the Dane was fouled or not. It was a wonderful ball into the area by Cornelius, which looked certain to be chipped over the onrushing keeper by Eriksen, but for the intervention of Hernandez. Simon Cornelius attacks down the left on the counter and drills a low ball in from the left. It’s a beautifully weighted ball for Christian Eriksen to chase, with Steve Mandada springing from the opposite direction. Eriksen nicks the ball and goes down under a joint challenge from Mandanda and Hernandez, who was galloping back. France clear their lines and Eriksen appeals for a penalty, but doesn’t get one.28 min: Simon Kjaer goes down holding his head after shipping an accidental blow to the head from a flailing arm while contesting a high ball. He’s soon OK to continue. 27 min: France win a penalty in the inside left channel and Lemar whips the ball across the face of goal. Simon Kjaer helps it out for a corner, managing to avoid lashing the ball into his own net in the process. 26 min: Hernandez attempts to pull the ball back for Griezmann on the edge of the Danish penalty area, but his delivery is wayward and Christian Eriksen intercepts. 24 min: There’s an appeal for handball on the edge of his penalty area by Zanka, after Osmane Dembele appears to kick the ball against his hand from close range. The referee isn’t interested, although penalties have been given for as much, if not less, in recent days. 21 min: Denmark win a corner, which Christian Eriksen takes. He raises his right arm and sends the ball into the six-yard box, where Raphael Varane heads clear. It breaks to Mathias Jorgensen (aka Zanka) on the edge of the penalty area, but France manage to clear.19 min: Meanwhile in Sochi, Peru have taken a 1-0 lead against Australia in this group’s other encounter. It’s good news for Denmark and you can keep tabs on that with Jonathan Howcroft.18 min: Raphael Varane appears to get his head to the ensuing inswinger, which sails wide. Replays show it actually went out off a Danish head. 14 min: France enjoy a period of possession, moving about three yards up the pitch in a 50-pass period of possession lasting a couple of minutes. They eventually find an opening, sticking what ITV co-comms man Glenn Hoddle describes as a “penetrating ball” into the box. Lucas Hernandez goes to ground under a challenge from Henrik Dalsgaard, appealing for a penalty as the ball breaks to Giroud. His chip is put out out for a corner by Schmeichel. 10 min: Under pressure from the busy Martin Braithwaite, Presnel Kimpembe shins the ball out for a corner while trying to shepherd it back to his goalkeeper. The linesman doesn’t spot this and a goal-kick is awarded, much to Braithwaite’s annoyance. France are struggling to keep up with Braithwaite at the moment – he’s had a very lively start and is making a nuisance of himself up front.8 min: France attempt to get the ball into the Danish penalty area with a Griezmann cross from the right. It’s overhit and Kasper Schmeichel claims comfortably. 7 min: Christian Eriksen sends the ball towards the near post, where Simon Kjaer gets the header, albeit while being tightly marked by Steven Nzonzi. The ball sails widce of the goal and Kjaer appeals for another corner. He doesn’t get one. 5 min: Replays suggest that Braithwaite didn’t have a case for a penalty and the VAR officials may well have said as much to the referee. The Dane goes on to drive into the penalty area and forces N’Golo Kante to concede the corner. 3 min: Andreas Cornelius wins a header, unleashing Martin Braithwaite. He takes the ball past two French defenders and goes to ground in the penalty area under pressure from two defenders. His appeals for a penalty fall on deaf ears and referee Sandro Ricci waves play on. 2 min: Djibril Sidibe, in at right-back for France, gets in behind his opposite number and drills a low, but fairly feeble cross into the Danish penalty area. It’s a mis-kick, surely. Olivier Giroud can’t head the ball when it’s that low.1 min: As expected Andreas Christensen lines up in the Danish midfield, as the game gets under way. 1 min: France kick off, wearing white shirts, navy shorts and white socks. Denmark’s players wear red shirts, white shorts and red socks. The anthems are over: Kick-off is just a coin-toss and several handshakes away. Not long now: The liveried volunteers have laid the the giant flags and Fifa logos out on the pitch and the teams are out. It’s time for the national anthems.Denmark’s Yussuf Poulsen is suspended and will sit this one out on the official Fifa designated Naughty Step. He is likely to be replaced by Martin Braithwaite, who doesn’t sound so much like a Danish footballer, as a mild-mannered window-cleaner with a dark, deeply troubled past on Coronation Street. William Kvist will play no further part in the tournament for Denmark after breaking two ribs and suffering a punctured lung in their opening win over Peru. France have a full squad to choose from, but their manager may choose to rotate with qualification for the knockout stages already assured. Experts’ Network: Events of the past fortnight may have overtaken some of the information contained in these World Cup previews, but they remain an invaluable guide to what you can expect from today’s teams.Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium is the venue for this Group C decider between Denmark and France. The French have already qualified for the knockout stages, while Denmark need one more point to join them. A cynic could be forgiven for thinking the two teams might collude to shaft Australia, who take on Peru in Sochi at the same time, needing a win to keep themselves in with any sort of shout of getting through on goal difference or goals scored ... if Denmark lose.

And Jonathan Howcroft for the Socceroos moment of truth in Sochi. Join Barry Glendenning here for buildup for the match in Moscow. Great video from our man in Sochi, Christopher Knaus, ahead of Australia v Peru. Aussie fans are fearing that France and Denmark will play out a draw in Moscow, meaning that whatever they manage against Peru becomes immaterial. The World Cup has an uncomfortable history of such events, and one game above all others comes to mind. It is fair to say that Ronaldo is not universally loved. Paul Pogba chose a typically understated means by which to look ahead to France playing Denmark. The social media hype is in full flow ahead of Australia’s big match. Unused sub Tim “#timcahill” Cahill has posted a picture of him sat on a bench. Here’s today’s World Cup Fiver, as penned by Rob Smyth. Rob Emsley emails in from lovely Newquay with a suggestion of how to liven up England v Belgium, the game that nobody, least of all Spanish Bob, seems to want to win. “Hello there, John Brewin. Have you considered the solution for Thursday that England and Belgium consent to switching ends and each attacking their own goal, thereby treating us to a spectacle of a properly fought-out game with the added bonus of goalkeepers who wouldn’t be allowed to handle the ball?”More on footballers being nice in real life. Presumably, this is isn’t Sir Gareth’s actual brother in law. Here’s  Australia reporter Christopher Knaus, who is in Sochi as a Socceroos fan, with a taste of the atmosphere ahead of the match with Peru.It’s a tense atmosphere for Australian fans in Sochi this morning. The green and gold of the Socceroos is noticeably outnumbered by the red and white of the Peruvians, who are in typically high spirits despite being out of the tournament. All week, Peru flags have been raised atop the cabanas along Sochi’s main waterfront strip, which looks out to the Black Sea. The Peruvians have packed out the bars and restaurants since the weekend, and break out in spontaneous singing and dancing on the beaches. Fans are just beginning to leave for the hour or so drive out to Fisht Stadium, part of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics complex. The Peruvians are confident. I haven’t met a single one who doesn’t ardently believe they will smash the Socceroos and go home with pride. When the World Cup and the transfer window collide. Belgium midfielder Marouane Fellaini had said he will reveal on Sunday whether he stays at Manchester United. “I know where I will be playing next season and I will announce it in the coming days,” said the Low Countries’ answer to Antoine Griezmann and Lebron James. “I’m at the end of my contract and I want to be free in my mind. That’s why I’ll be announcing it next week.” Asked if he would reveal those plans on Sunday, July 1, he replied: “Yes.” Arsenal fans: get ready to celebrate your new signing...More on Pepe then off-field charmer from Robert Lowery. “Your anecdote about Pepe being a decent guy when not acting like a complete $*#@ on the field speaks to a nugget of wisdom I am fond of rolling out. We build these pictures of players characters in our minds often based on little beyond how they behave on the field, what they look like and what they say in brief boring interviews. Which of the Class of ‘92 is the sound one or who from the current England team would make a good brother in law? A friend of mine was even more stark in this regard. He reckoned that it takes such abnormal ego to make it to the very top that anyone looking at a player and saying “Yeah, we’d be mates” was probably making a losing bet.”The Nationalmannschaft’s most famous fan will not be attending Germany’s match with South Korea in Kazan. According to Associated Press, Chancellor Angela Merkel, under severe domestic political pressure in a dispute over migration, was asked if she would go to the match because she might not get another chance to see coach Joachim Loew’s team.Merkel said she has to be in parliament this week, “but of course I sincerely wish the team all the best and of course I hope for a good outcome after we all went through torture, in the truest sense of the word during the last game.”News from the Belgium camp, via the Press Association. Every member of the Belgium squad - apart from Romelu Lukaku, who continues to be assessed after having a scan on an ankle injury - trained on Tuesday morning.Manager Roberto Martinez has hinted that he will make changes and midfielder Marouane Fellaini said: “If we want to go far in this World Cup, we will need every player. Everybody is ready to play, everybody wants to play. It will be an interesting game against England, but it will be a strange one also because both teams are qualified.”A couple of tweets from readers still exercised by last night’s VAR controversy and general ref rage. A personal view: it’s made what might have been rubbish games into some highly amusing spectacles. And there’s plenty more where that came from.This was a truly excellent game. Who needed Maradona when you had Hagi? How about those Golden Boot standings? Cristiano Ronaldo might have been level with Harry Kane had he not missed that penalty last night against Iran.The Uruguay v Portugal match last-16 tie set for Saturday looks set to be true a VAR nasty, and brings back memories of the 2006 World Cup match, played at the same stage of the competition.It ended 1-0 to Portugal in Nuremburg, but the real scoreline was in the collection of two red cards each and 16 yellows overall. The image of Barcelona team-mates Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Deco sat with each other on a stadium step watching the game play out is indelible but here’s a picture of them doing battle on the pitch and our report from that night. Nobody wants to see football played like that until the chaos descends.After the glory of their opening two matches, Russian fans took losing to Uruguay pretty hard. Andrew Roth reports. And on the home front, here’s some Liverpool news. Roberto Martínez has been speaking ahead of England v Belgium.Asked whether English players had improved technically, he said: “Very good question. I think it’s been a huge evolution. When I started in the Premier League in 2009 it was a real contrast in styles in the league, but I think the English players have developed an incredible awareness from a tactical point of view. That’s been the biggest difference in the last five or six years. Having St George’s Park, having a real structure in the way England teams play, you’ve seen the success with the Under-17 teams, and the Under-20s, the way there is a winning culture, and probably I would say in the last six years the English players have now got that intensity and the real pace, but with a real tactical awareness, that is brought by the way teams are playing in the Premier League.”Kári Tulinius emails in. “One moment from yesterday that I found quite touching, but hasn’t gotten much attention, was seeing Pepe, of cartoonish football villainy fame, console an Iranian player (Pouraliganji, I think, but I’m not sure). It was a lovely, humane gesture from a source not normally associated with lovely, humane gestures.”I am told, by friends who have spoken to him on a regular basis, that Pepe is actually a really nice bloke. My own interaction with him is limited, but when it comes to turning down a chat in a mixed zone there are few more polite in delivering their rebuffs.Anywhere, here’s an image to perhaps change some minds. There have been some cultural issues Down Under. From elsewhere in the world of football, Suzanne Wrack has news on Sheffield FC. Spain got lucky last night against Morocco and they know it. Somehow, they managed to top Group B and will face Russia in Moscow on Sunday. AS and Marca had identical headlines declaring: “Long Live VAR!” Consummate diplomat Sergio Ramos is asking for everyone to cool their boots, while admitting that there is much to be ironed out. “We got through and won the group, that was the objective, but the game wasn’t good at all for us, it’s a night for everyone in the squad to take a look at themselves, we need to get ourselves into gear,” the Kop’s pariah said. “There’s no need to panic, but we do need to evaluate ourselves generally and inidually, we can all contribute more and be more balanced defensively and solid so we can make the difference in attack.” Defence looks to be Spain’s biggest problem, judging by their three group matches. “When you play in a team that causes so much damage in attack you have to be a little more careful, that’s what makes the difference, we need to be more solid, there’s no margin for error now, one mistake will throw you out,” Ramos said. “We prefer to do our talking on the pitch and I hope we can have a great game against Russia, who have been playing at a very high level. I hope we can impose ourselves on them, we need to show who we are as soon as possible.”All you hip young gunslingers who use Instagram should sign up to the  Sport account for great stuff like this. David Squires’ latest is here for your amusement and delectation. David Penney emails in. “One reason I love the World Cup is to discover great players that I previously was unaware of. Last time it was Mexico’s Andres Guardado, who is a cracking player. This time, coincidentally another left winger, Denmark’s Pione Sisto seems like a real handful! Can’t wait to see how he fares against France.”Pre-tournament darlingscynical hatchet men on our brave boys (delete where applicable) Panama are going home, but not without a final fixture with Tunisia in Nizhny Novgorod. Here’s where pride can be salvaged, in the style of Saudi Arabia’s defeat of Egypt on Monday. Their goalscorer in the 6-1 defeat to England, Felipe Baloy, who will be retiring from international football after the match, has been talking. “We’ve studied Tunisia, who are a difficult rival, but still it is an opportunity to achieve a historic win,” he said on Tuesday. “The experience in Russia has been top-notch, we hope that Panama can keep growing. As a group we’ve had a good coexistence in which we’ve spent time with the youngest players, who will stay on.” Morning all, let’s begin this session with a quiz. “What happened next?” was always the best round of Question of Sport. You’ll have to imagine David Coleman’s gleeful chuckles yourself, though. That’s all from me as I prepare to pass the baton smoothly over to the enlightening John Brewin for more news, quips and commentary on what has been a brilliant World Cup so far. Thanks for your company, and your emails. GoodbyeIt’s Denmark v France at 3pm BST today and the French press have added a bit of needle by dragging up some pre-tournament quotes from Åge Hareide. The Denmark insists his comments were taken out of context, but could the fact he said France were “nothing special”, they lacked a “leader such as Zinedine Zidane” and Pogba only cared about his haircut come back to bit him? As Ed Aarons reports, these teams have history …Is Jorge Valdano’s damning take on the ugly obsession with winning that is crippling Argentinian football the best football article ever written? Big talk, you say, but Gary Lineker has gone that far … Don’t cry for me Argentina, read it and weep … Belgium could make as many as 10 changes against England, with Roberto Martínez intent on keeping competition for places fierce … The Group G decider seems to be the match noon is too bothered about winning, and here’s why: ’s top man in Russia Daniel Taylor reckons Gareth Southgate faces a dilemma over Harry Kane for Thursday’s final group game against Belgium. To play or not to play is the conundrum for the waist-coated one: Mark Pearson reckons that it’s not the on-field referees who are to blame for the VAR fails, it’s their fully-kitted friends in the studio. Don’t hate the player, hate the game is the general gist of his email:“In defence of the referee (not something I ever thought I’d say) last night, he got the decision right in the first instance. He was then told by a team of officials with access to multiple replays that he should have another look, which inevitably plants the suggestion in his mind that he got it wrong. From the replays we were shown at home, angle A made it look like a handball (it looked like it dropped straight onto his arm rather than being headed against his arm), where as angles B, C, D, etc, made it very clear that it was accidental. For some reason, the poor ref was only shown the same few frames from angle A again and again, rocked back and forth with the ball hitting the arm. Based on the evidence he was shown, it looked like a stonewall penalty. So the fault is with the guys in the VAR room, not the ref. Another example of VAR poorly implemented.”Des Kelly begs to differ …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/811f0c5b74163acc6ae6e708a92ed10a7475ae54/1061_270_882_529/master/882.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS90d2l0dGVyX2RlZmF1bHQucG5n\u0026amp;s=d9734ac8ac5959ba48a7193cc4cc6ae6","title":"nigel slater ham with cherries and mustard recipe","story":"Chunks of succulent meat with sweet fruit and a herby dressingWhisk together the following ingredients: an egg yolk, 1 tbsp each of smooth and grainy mustard, 3 tbsp olive oil and a little salt.Chop 4 or 5 bushy sprigs of dill – enough to give you 2 heaped tbsp – then stir them into the dressing with 1 tbsp of liquid honey and 2 tsp of capers.Halve and stone 300g of cherries and add them to the dressing.

A ghost story in an outdoor setting on a perfect summer’s night? It sounds improbable but this joint venture between the Open Air theatre and English National Opera works superbly well and, in the second half, you even feel a chill to the spine as you watch a battle for possession of children’s souls in the gathering dusk.It helps that Timothy Sheader, as director, and his designer, Soutra Gilmour, know how to use the space. Bly, the remote country house at which a governess arrives to take charge of the children, Miles and Flora, is here seen as a dilapidated conservatory surrounded by mounds of unruly grass. The action also erupts around the whole theatre. The prologue is sung by William Morgan from the front stalls. Peter Quint’s night-time summons to Miles takes place from the auditorium and the blanched figure of Miss Jessel stalks the side aisles. Even the orchestra, glimpsed behind an upstage wall and excellently conducted by Toby Purser, takes on a ghostly quality.Debate still rages as to what Britten’s opera, with a libretto by Myfanwy Piper based on the 1898 Henry James novella, is finally about. Are we watching the governess’s attempt to rescue the children from the corrupting clutches of the ghostly Quint and Miss Jessel? Or could the ghosts be projections of the troubled mind of the governess herself? The latter has become a fashionable interpretation, but Sheader’s production left me feeling that we were watching a genuine contest with forces of evil. Without disguising the governess’s complexity (like Quint, she says of Miles, “You shall be mine”), Anita Watson powerfully makes her a woman driven more by moral anxiety than by luridly subjective fantasy.Britten’s rich score is full of strange echoes: as Humphrey Carpenter points out in his biography, the governess’s musical identity is surprisingly tied up with that of Quint. Yet Sheader’s production, without being heavy-handed, unequivocally suggests this is an opera about child abuse. Miles and Flora, from the start, seem dangerously knowing. Mrs Grose, the housekeeper, tells the governess that Quint “was free with everyone”. The key moment, however, comes in Quint’s night call to Miles. The expressive features of the extraordinary Daniel Alexander Sidhom light up as he hears Quint’s voice, strips off his clothes and dons a purple shirt replicating that of the ghost. The intimacy between them is underlined when, as Miles plays the piano, Elgan Llŷr Thomas’s Quint sinisterly turns the pages.Two casts share the roles during the week’s run: the first night one was impeccable. Elen Willmer as Flora, precisely echoing the gestures of Elin Pritchard’s Miss Jessel, imply their bond is as strong as that of Miles and Quint. Janis Kelly, who has sung every female role in the opera, makes Mrs Grose a memorably troubled figure: not the conventional homebody, but a woman who palpably loves the children and who at one point clutches a pillar in fear for their safety. It’s a fine production that gathers in intensity as darkness falls. But it struck me that the real villain of Britten’s opera, as of James’s story, is the children’s unseen : it is he who, by his negligence, commits the ultimate crime of leaving the innocent to their terrible fate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/694e7df578762c687cd4180545414a1e0e3cdce4/542_696_5419_3250/master/5419.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73063cfbd0834fe419d255412645dcdf","title":"petra kvitova nature valley international johanna konta","story":"When you can’t stop winning, just keep going. Less than 24 hours after arriving in Eastbourne following her victory in Birmingham at the weekend, Petra Kvitova adjusted quickly to the change in conditions with a 7-5, 6-3 win over Kateryna Bondarenko of Ukraine on Tuesday to book her place in the third round of the Nature Valley International.In glorious sunshine and just the slightest breeze, the 28-year-old Czech won five straight games from 3-1 down in the second set to earn her 38th win of the year, the most on the WTA Tour. It was not her most fluent performance but she got the job done as she continues to build towards Wimbledon, where she won in 2011 and 2014.Victory in Birmingham had given Kvitova a fifth title of 2018. She is the bookmakers’ favourite for Wimbledon, all the more remarkable given that she returned to the Tour only in June of last year, following the horrific attack in her home in December 2016 that left her requiring four hours of surgery on her dominant left hand.Kvitova might have been tempted to give Eastbourne a miss after last week’s success, resting up for Wimbledon. Instead, she made her way down to the south coast on Monday and though she struggled for rhythm on serve, she was still too good for world No\u0026nbsp89 Bondarenko.“It was very quick,” Kvitova said, of the turnaround. “I just came yesterday. I had a little warm-up and then the match.

With local authority cost-cutting threatening closures, many of these pools are now run by volunteers, having been saved by their communities.And don’t be deterred if the heatwave doesn’t last – many of these pools are heated, and swimming in the rain can be a glorious experience. Southern England has by far the greatest density of lidos in the UK, but here are 10 lesser-known gems across the country, all near or on the way to holiday hotspots.There are very few lidos that are free to use, but Mount Wise is one of them. Right on the harbour wall at the very bottom of James Street, it is a complex of three pools in a sheltered sun trap. All three are heated, from the main tank right down to the free-form paddling pools with fountain and lazy river. There are sun-loungers, sea views and salt air it’s the sort of pool that’s ideal for a day out but also, like Hilsea (below), worth remembering for a dip after a long ferry crossing. • everyoneactiveTucked into the beautiful Lincolnshire countryside, Woodhall Spa has a charm that harks back to simpler times. At its heart is Jubilee Park, featuring recreation grounds, rose gardens, a bandstand and a heated 33-metre pool that sits in its own immaculately manicured grounds. There is a lovely campsite in the park, right next to the pool, so campers can practically roll out of bed into the water. Next to the main pool is a baby pool, and there’s a slide and a fountain to entertain younger swimmers. While lounging on the grass with a good book and some cake from the excellent on-site cafe is another option. • jubileeparkwoodhallspaIf holidaying in the Cotswolds, a visit to Stratford Park is a must. This vintage, 50-metre, unheated pool sits in beautiful grassy grounds, with sun terraces and a listed ing platform – sadly, no longer in use but still soaring elegantly above the pool. This pool is perfect for less confident swimmers, as it has two shallow ends, with the deep water running across the middle of it. The indoor pool on the same site has some catering facilities, but taking a picnic to eat on the grass is highly recommended. • everyoneactiveThe Shropshire Hills, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, is rightly popular with walkers. Within easy reach of the area lies Highley and its heated 25-metre outdoor pool. The pool has been refurbished recently and sits alongside modern facilities. An added bonus is that swimmers can get to the lido on the scenic steam train on the Severn Valley Railway. • haloleisure.org.ukIf you find the North Sea a little chilly for a holiday dip then look no further than Haltwhistle. This small community, on the southern fringe of the Northumberland national park, boasts a fine outdoor pools complex. There are three heated pools, set in grassy grounds that are ideal for picnicking or snacking from the on-site cafe. The cherry on a very fine cake is the huge flume that runs alongside the pools. Water slide lovers young and old will be enchanted. • haltwhistleleisureFor those heading north for a holiday in Scotland on the A74(M)M74, the detour to New Cumnock, is a breathtaking drive. New Cumnock itself isn’t a holiday destination but the newly renovated outdoor pool makes the detour very worthwhile. It has benefited from significant investment, and now provides a heated, modern, almost spa-like experience with chic tiling, muted colours that mirror the hills beyond and the smartest changing rooms imaginable. A swim as the sun sets over the town is a particular feast for the senses here, and there is a train station just 10 minutes’ walk from the pool for those using public transport.• dumfries-house.org.ukIngleton sits in a fairytale-like glen, approached via a wooded path to the valley floor, where the pool sits in what feels like a secret grotto.

One side of the site is given over to terraced seating, with tables and chairs above it from which guests can look down onto the pool, while enjoying a snack from the kiosk.• ingletonpoolMillions use the M5 every year, travelling to the clear seas, sandy beaches and rugged bluffs of Devon and Cornwall. But those who fall foul of the holiday traffic jams might want to break the journey for sanity’s sake. Portishead pool, just 10 minutes off the M5 near Bristol, is the perfect place.

Give them the final already – or at least a travel showThe best World Cups are defined by unexpected heroes, exuberant eccentrics or unfancied outsiders who rise to the occasion. So, who’s Russia 2018’s Roger Milla or Totò Schillaci? The clear breakout stars of the tournament so far are in the ITV commentary box: Jon Champion and Ally McCoist.The pair aren’t seen by ITV as a frontline pairing. They are not given the big games. But this frees them up. They’re not obliged to hype up England, to find endless superlatives for Ronaldo and Messi or pretend that Brazil play exciting “samba” football. Instead, Champion and McCoist are on duty for neutral rubbers such as Sweden v South Korea and Poland v Senegal. Matches like that are one of the main joys of a World Cup: yes, it’s a chance to see the globe’s top stars, but it’s also a collective effort to take an interest in unfamiliar rookies playing games the British viewer has no stake in. Suddenly, Croatia v Nigeria is viable Saturday-night entertainment.At least, it is when you have Ally McCoist as co-commentator, a man audibly excited by the pure sporting pleasure of not knowing which bunch of 11 blokes will outplay the other. Unlike a couple of his BBC opposite numbers, McCoist has read up on the teams he’s covering and arrives ready to offer them praise and respect, rather than looking for controversy to whine about. He sounds happy to be there.Opening every co-commentary with a cheery “Good afternoonevening, everyone”, a la David Pleat on 5 Live, McCoist clearly loves the fans, the occasion and the football, regularly describing passages of play as “lovely”, “gorgeous”, “smashing” or, in the case of Colombia’s skilful midfield, “very, very easy on the eye”. Being paid to sit in a box seat at the World Cup is a privilege: McCoist knows it, and he’s going to make sure we enjoy it with him.Actually, enjoying it with him is veteran lead commentator Jon Champion, who describes himself in his Twitter bio as: “Currently acting as valet to Ally McCoist.” That sums up their flourishing comic partnership. Champion is wry, droll and slightly florid in his speech patterns, the ideal foil for McCoist’s puppyish glee.As you’ll know if you’ve endured Sam Matterface and Lee Dixon’s tense attempts at you-never-get-a-round-in banter, portraying a joshing friendship on air is not easy, but Champion and McCoist evidently do get on. The classic ego clash, where the commentator hates being interrupted and the co-commentator wants to assert their authority as an ex-pro, isn’t there. These two are just mates on holiday.Their big moment at this tournament, the summarising equivalent of a 25-yard worldie by a previously unknown Costa Rican left-back, was McCoist’s cultural guide to the Russian city of Kazan during Poland v Colombia, when Champion asked McCoist for his thoughts on the match’s host city.“It’s unbelievable, Jon!” said McCoist. “If you put me in a corner and nailed me, it’s probably my favourite place on the trip so far, Kazan. Unbelievable. It’s come a long way since it fell to Ivan the Terrible in 1552 … we had a wonderful trip around the Qol Sharif mosque this morning, which is situated within the Kazan Kremlin. Just some stunning – absolutely stunning – architecture Jon, I’ve got to tell you.”This was liquid commentary. There was a note of Alan Partridge buffoonery about it that, in fairness, isn’t usually so evident in Champion \u0026amp McCoist’s work, but it was done knowingly. As the game went on, the pair turned the idea of one specialising in football stats and the other in historical facts into an increasingly snappy comedy riff – and McCoist’s sheer enthusiasm meant he could carry it off.Time spent with Champion and McCoist is an old-school comfort. It gives me the same feeling I get from old clips of Barry Davies, or from merely reading the words “Tony Gubba”. C\u0026ampM create a retro glow during live games. It’s not just McCoist’s positive attitude and avuncular Lanarkshire burr: Champion’s commentary has a lovely (gorgeous, smashing) rise and fall to it that recalls the “Extreme Measures, with Trevor Eve” scene in The Trip, where Rob Brydon schools Steve Coogan on how to give a BBC1 ident “a sense of homecoming”. Champion expertly does that with every sentence.Twitter users have indeed demanded that Champion and McCoist be given a Trip-like travel show. A series where the two of them twin-room it around Europe, looking at churches and rocking up to Michelin-starred restaurants slightly too casually dressed, would totally work.“This is a lovely little blanquette de veau from the Frenchman. Unbelievable, Jon.”“You couldn’t honestly describe this Bordeaux as undrinkable either, Ally.”Before then, today at 3pm, you have a choice. The nominal glamour tie in Group C is France v Denmark, so that’s on ITV. But on ITV4, where hard-working Australia take on the gifted, but misfiring Peru, Champion and McCoist are commentating, so that’s where I’ll be.And I tell you what, Jon: I’d give them the final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a824a94e73deb843ff4e8a01d25106599c6e957/0_118_4712_2827/master/4712.jpg?w=740\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59a9f505c8805f135d3180a3ef9ab575 740w","title":"emmanuel macron meeting pope francis vatican french president","story":"Hour of talks with pontiff puts French president’s religious views in spotlightThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, who has been accused in France of straining the country’s secular foundations by seeking to mend ties with the Catholic church, has held an unusually long meeting with Pope Francis. The two men spoke for nearly an hour in the official papal library in the Vatican’s Apostolic Palace, the longest time the pontiff has spent in a meeting with a head of state.The Vatican said the pair discussed protection of the environment, migration, and multilateral commitment to conflict prevention and resolution, especially in relation to disarmament.They also spoke about prospects for resolving conflicts in the Middle East and Africa and the future of Europe, it said. At the end of the private audience, Macron gave the pope a rare copy of Georges Bernanos’ 1936 novel The Diary of a Country Priest. “I’ve read this book many times and it has done me good. It is a book that I have always loved very much,” the pope told Macron, who was accompanied in the public part of the meeting by his wife, Brigitte. The pontiff gave Macron a medallion of Martin of Tours, a 4th-century saint who is depicted cutting his cloak in half to give to a beggar in winter. “This means the vocation of those who govern is to help the poor. We are all poor,” the pope told Macron as he gave him the medallion. As Macron left the library, he and the pontiff exchanged a two-cheek kiss, another unusual gesture between a pope and a visiting head of state. The Vatican was expected to issue a statement on the themes discussed during the private talks. Previous talks between the pope and a president have never exceeded 50 minutes. The pope spoke to Barack Obama for 50 minutes and Donald Trump for 30 minutes. Two months ago, Macron called for stronger ties between the state and the Catholic church, a move critics said blurred a line that had kept French government free of religious intervention for generations.The issue is particularly sensitive in historically Catholic France, where matters of faith and state were separated by law in 1905 and which is now home to Europe’s largest Muslim and Jewish population. France’s guiding principles also hold that religious observance is a private matter, for all faiths. Macron was raised in a non-religious family and was baptised a Roman Catholic at his own request when he was 12."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1bbfb3a60c129b071ecce3a4552837b8def6b16/0_226_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e81800c2ae2d3b05ad72e3bf2abd0e","title":"saudi arabia is not driving change it is trying to hoodwink the west","story":"The country has lifted its ban on female drivers, but this is a rebrand, not a revolution. Yet many governments – and media outlets – are being taken inIf I see one more article about Saudi women being able to drive I am going to throw myself under a car. Don’t get me wrong, I am glad Saudi Arabia has lifted the world’s only ban on women driving. But I am also worried. Rather than being a meaningful step towards progress, as much of the coverage suggests, the reversal of the driving ban is quite the opposite. Allowing women behind the wheel is a PR move by Saudi Arabia, designed not to modernise the kingdom, but to render a repressive regime more palatable. Yet many western media outlets seem to be falling for this strategic “women-washing”, as you might call it, hook, line and blinker.The irony of Saudi Arabia jailing women’s rights activists at the same time as it lifted its driving ban did not go unacknowledged by the media. However, the jailed activists were the secondary story. Most headlines have played into the narrative of reform that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has been pushing. This week’s cover of the Economist, for example, read “The Saudi revolution begins”, alongside a cute visual of a niqab with car wheels representing a woman’s eyes. But there is no revolution happening in Saudi Arabia. What is happening is a rebrand.It was reported last year that Saudi Arabia was setting up global public relations hubs to improve its international image amid its bombing of Yemen and its embargo of Qatar. Well, the Saudi PR machine has been very busy indeed. When Prince Mohammed visited the UK in March, he was accompanied by a massive advertising campaign. Messages such as “He is empowering Saudi Arabian women” covered billboards and taxis. They even appeared in the .Saudi Arabia’s messaging points have been regurgitated by the media, too. In November, Thomas Friedman wrote what was essentially a puff piece about Prince Mohammed in the New York Times, titled “Saudi Arabia’s Arab Spring, at Last”. Then, in March, Prince Mohammed appeared on CBS’s 60 Minutes, his first interview with an American television network. “He is emancipating women, introducing music and cinema and cracking down on corruption, in a land with 15,000 princes,” announced the introduction to an extremely softball interview. In the 30-minute segment, only a couple were devoted to Yemen, and these were glossed over quickly. After all, who wants to talk about war crimes and dead Yemenis when you can talk about cinemas and women driving? Particularly when the US and the UK are complicit in Saudi Arabia’s disastrous war in Yemen.That is the salient point here. Ultimately, the celebratory coverage around Saudi Arabia lifting its driving ban is a reflection of the fact that it is in the west’s best interest for the kingdom to be painted in a good light. It is terribly inconvenient, after all, to acknowledge that your lucrative trading partner, whose war efforts you are backing, is an abusive, authoritarian regime. Far better to focus on lovely photos of women in cars.“This feels like one of those flashbacks in The Handmaid’s Tale,” joked my girlfriend as we made our way across Manhattan on Sunday morning, heading towards a gay pride party. “You know, when they’re showing how things used to be.” She was right: New York on Sunday was the antithesis of Trump’s US. Rainbow flags were everywhere and the whole city seemed to have come out to celebrate love at this year’s annual parade. It was wonderful. But, in the current political climate, it was also a little weird. Celebrating pride felt immensely privileged and extremely precarious.At a time when progress can no longer be taken for granted, this year’s pride was an important reminder of just how far gay rights have come. I have been out for 16 years and it is astonishing to see how quickly attitudes have changed in the US and the UK. Pollsters have called the shift in public opinion on gay rights “unprecedented”. In 2015, when the US supreme court ruled in favour of legalising same-sex marriage, President Obama stated: “I know a change for many of our LGBT brothers and sisters must have seemed so slow for so long. But compared to so many other issues, America’s shift has been so quick.”It is generally not useful to argue about which minority has it worst. However, I think it is important to acknowledge “gay privilege”, to recognise that gay rights have leapfrogged those of many other minorities in the west. It is particularly important to remember this now and to ensure that the most privileged members of the gay community, particularly affluent, white gay men, support other oppressed groups. Pride has turned into a corporate festival. Now, more than ever, it needs to be a political protest.This week’s contender for “I can’t believe this isn’t satire” goes to a US startup called Ambulnz. What fresh, stupidly spelled hell is this, you ask? According to its website, “Ambulnz is a new kind of on-demand ambulance services provider”. I thought all ambulances were on-demand, but what do I know? Wait, there is more! Ambulnz is apparently “transforming medical transportation through the use of disruptive technology”, whatever that means. I am still not sure what Ambulnz does, but it has done a brilliant job of straddling the dystopian intersection of the US’s broken healthcare system and Silicon Valley bombast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/623f72fe415abb63a7244ce0b17a56c6e7c04bc0/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e56e8bfa56f2d14d9245e61b48521fc","title":"tobacco indonesia child labour harvest","story":"In a country that is the world’s fifth-largest tobacco producer, children work despite labour lawsAs a young girl, Julaeping Putri loved to play, even take naps, among the fresh mounds of tobacco leaves piled around her home on the Indonesian island of Lombok.Her mother, Nurul Huda, thought nothing of it at the time. She liked having the stacks of leaves there too – a reminder it had been a plentiful, lucrative harvest.From as young as three, Julaeping, or Eping for short, said she would help her parents out in the field, planting the small Virginia tobacco saplings, mixing the fertiliser, watering the plants. In harvest season, Eping and her friends would spend hours after school tying the tobacco leaves on to large poles, getting them ready for the “ovens”, village smokehouses where the leaves are smoked dry for almost a week. Sometimes they would play a game, racing each other to see who could do it the fastest. But it wasn’t always fun. A few times during the harvest Eping felt so ill she collapsed. Her mother, too busy with the yield to take her to hospital, called in the local nurse to give her an injection. In the decade since, her health problems have never really gone away. “Since second grade, I have been sick in the chest, and then sometimes it is hard to breathe,” says Eping, now 14. It’s always worse in tobacco harvest season, she says, especially when they unfurl the leaves from the ovens, when the smell of tobacco is most pungent. “I have felt like throwing up before because the tobacco smell is so strong. It happens often, that you want to keep throwing up,” she says, “After opening up the leaves, I feel sick in the chest and my heart starts to beat very fast.”According to a 2016 report by Human Right Watch entitled The Harvest Is in My Blood, thousands of children work in Indonesia’s tobacco industry, where they are exposed to serious health risks.Based on interviews with more than 130 children, the report notes that symptoms described, such as vomiting and nausea, are consistent with acute nicotine poisoning, caused by contact with tobacco plants and leaves.Green tobacco sickness is a form of nicotine poisoning that workers can be vulnerable to absorbing through their skin, especially if the leaves are wet because of rain, dew or sweat.What are the symptoms? Nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, headaches, and dizziness while farmers are working or several hours after work ends. Symptoms can last 24 hours extreme cases may require emergency help. Tobacco firms say they ban under 18s from hazardous work and only allow them to handle dry tobacco when there is no risk to health.One US study found about one in four workers harvesting tobacco in North Carolina suffered from green tobacco sickness in a single season.Last year Eping’s parents took her to the doctor to find out if her repeated complaint, a tightness in her chest and shortness of breath, was connected to her exposure to tobacco.Her elder brother Jovi, 28, laughs scathingly when asked about the diagnosis. “The doctors here aren’t brave enough to be honest. They don’t say it is related to tobacco but we know,” he says, as he draws on a cigarette himself. “Maybe brave is not the right word. Maybe they are afraid there might be a demonstration.”Tobacco has long been big business in Indonesia. According to research by Euromonitor International, Indonesia produced 269.2bn cigarettes in 2015, while the market was valued at 231.3tn rupiah (£12.4bn, $16.6bn at current exchange rates).Across the country tobacco advertising and smoking is widespread – for Indonesian men, lighting up is considered the uncontroversial norm. Rules are so lax and cigarettes so cheap – one packet is less than £2 – that many start from an early age.With such a large presence, the industry is a powerful lobby in Indonesia and campaigners say it is quick to push back against pressure. In Beleke, residents talk of the financial benefits of tobacco to the village. Next to rice and corn, tobacco is the most lucrative crop but it can only be grown in the dry season, from about May to September.Home to about 3,000 families, the village is spread across fields of brilliant green rice paddies that become replaced entirely with tobacco plants in the growing season.“No one stays home in harvesting season. You find people young and old around the ovens and in the fields. Everyone is collecting money and everyone is happy about that,” says Anggi, 42, a farmer.Almost all the children above the age of four work – some begrudgingly because their parents ask them to, others because they want to earn money.“My daughter helps me in the field, putting the fertiliser on the trees and also carrying the water,” said Anggi. “That is the picture of all the mothers and farmers who have children in the village.”For almost two months during the harvest, carts of tobacco leaves are hauled into the village and the children are called in to help prepare them for the smokehouses, knitting them on to large sticks and getting paid by the stick.Some of the children the  meets talk about what they can get with the money from tobacco work, but they also describe long hours. “I like doing it because I get money,” says Aning, age 12, who first started working six years ago. “I can buy snacks at school, or toys, like a doll. I start after school, from midday until about 5pm. I can earn about Rp 15,000 (£0.81, $1.08) and I do that every day in the season.”Aning’s best friend is only six years old, but last year he worked so hard during the tobacco season that he saved 1m rupiah (£52, $70). “If I keep working in the night, I can get Rp 50,000 (£2.69, $3.60). After praying time at 7.30pm, I work until about midnight,” he says. “School starts at 8 in the morning. So we are often late in the season.”While Indonesian labour laws prohibit anyone under the age of 18 from performing hazardous work, in practice, especially in small-scale farming in Indonesia’s under-developed eastern regions, the laws are often poorly enforced and understood.After it is roasted, the tobacco grown by Beleke’s small-scale farmers is sold to middlemen, who transport it by the ton to one of several warehouses on the island. Mostly it is sold to a warehouse controlled by the Indonesian tobacco company Djarum.One middleman, speaking anonymously, tells the  the company is unaware children are involved in production, but admits that no one asks questions about the issue. Djarum declined to respond to questions about child labour.The five big transnational tobacco companies say child labour was unacceptable and that they were working hard to stop it happening in their supply chain. They said they were encouraging farmers to grow other crops, but added that tobacco gave farms a better income.No one interviewed in Beleke sees it as problematic that children work in the tobacco industry. One teenage boy, Restu, 13, illustrates just how lax attitudes around tobacco in the village are.“All my teachers smoke,” he replies, when asked what he learns about smoking at school. “Even my headmaster smokes around us at school.”With her repeated ill health but no definitive diagnosis, Eping’s parents aren’t entirely sure what to think. They say they have asked her to stop working during harvest.“Sometimes I ask her to stop working, but she is so fast at it and I’m happy with that,” says her mother, Nurul Huda.“And sometimes she just disappears,” she adds, with a shrug. “Every time she comes back carrying money.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab0161c42e7340c7e7a738548deda0e8b45fb75/0_270_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee088ea01eef6eff1c5cff14b610572","title":"yangtze at 100km intervals a photo essay","story":"Mother River is a four-year project for which the British-Chinese photographer Yan Wang Preston photographed the 6,211km Yangtze river at precise 100km intervals with a large-format film cameraMother River is a four-year project for which the British-Chinese photographer Yan Wang Preston photographed the 6,211km Yangtze river at precise 100km intervals with a large-format film cameraThe Yangtze river is usually celebrated by idealistic images of iconic places. But with Mother River, Yan Wang Preston wanted to undermine the deep-seated preference towards certain river places and their landscape representations. By selecting photographic sites at equally spaced locations, she did not necessarily produce a picturesque view. Instead, the project is filled with random landscapes that have rarely been photographed before. The project aims to tell a story of the entire width of China from its western highland to its eastern coast and demonstrates that in an era of abundant satellite mapping and saturated imagery, fresh views can still be created by a simple mapping exercise.“In modern China though, it is the Yangtze that has been promoted by the central government as the main national icon. This is to do with the Yangtze’s importance for China’s development. It provides the most important trade route into the wealthiest area of China. It is the physical and metaphorical frontline of China’s modernisation, with over 30 hydroelectric dams planned or constructed on it. It provides an analogy for China’s political unification as it is the longest river in China which ‘connects’ all the regions from Tibet to Shanghai. For all these reasons the Yangtze is in focus, and that’s why I wanted to work on it”“My journey began at 5,400m above sea level in the uninhabited zone known as the Tibetan Plateau. From here, the Yangtze river flows through majestic mountains with almost no access at all, before hitting the industrial lowland near Shanghai.”“Inhospitable terrain and huge distances made this project a modern-day adventure, with many potential hazards including high-altitude sickness, off-road driving, floods, sandstorms, earthquakes, landslides and mudslides.”“Not surprisingly, the process of realising the Mother River project wasn’t without incident. Two locations (Y15 \u0026amp Y16) remain unreached to this day, while 24 locations (Y39 - Y62) were originally depicted in poorly exposed images, because I loaded the films back-to-front by mistake. (I decided to re-shoot afterwards). It is precisely these imperfections that testify to the physicality of this highly conceptual project, and which also give it a particularly ‘human’ touch.”Yan Wang Preston is an award-winning British-Chinese artist. Mother River has won the Shiseido photography prize (Beijing, 2016) and Reviewers’ Choice Award at FORMAT (Derby, 2014). It was nominated for both the Prix Pictet award and The Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation prize."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3544232.1530011145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dubliners face water restrictions as potential drought looms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDubliners are facing unavoidable water restrictions following a prolonged spell of dry weather. Photograph: ShutterstockDubliners are facing “unavoidable” water restrictions with a potential drought looming following the long spell of dry weather, Irish Water has warned.A yellow weather warning is in place for the rest of the week across the country with temperatures expected to hit 30 degrees in parts of the midlands and west.However, the risk of drought is particularly acute in the greater Dublin area, with demand on water supplies reaching “concerning levels”, according to Irish Water.The utility can produce 610 million litres of water per day to serve the Dublin area. Last summer, an average of 565 million litres of water per day was used. But last Friday 602 million litres of water was used and overnight on Monday the levels were at 609 million litres leaving “almost no margin of supply over demand” Irish Water said.“If the drought is prolonged, water restrictions would become unavoidable given the trends. Irish Water are appealing to the public to be mindful of their water usage, ” Irish Water’s corporate affairs manager, Kate Gannon said.The utility’s drought management team is monitoring daily water supplies and demand, she said.“Our drought management team are monitoring the situation daily across the country and we intend to provide regular updates nationally and at regional level, so that the public is aware of the position as it develops.“This is a very serious situation and we are seeking the public’s help. Every effort the public make to conserve water will help to minimise risk of supply loss to them and their community.”At many of water schemes around the country, supply and demand was already under pressure and the spell of warm weather has exacerbated this situation. Demand for water is increasing while levels in rivers and lakes are dropping significantly which means that is there is less water available to treat and supply to homes and businesses, Irish Water said.At the same time, the sources, especially our main raw water storage at Pollaphuca, is dropping at similar rates to previous droughts in 1975, 1976, and 1995. To minimise the risk of supply failure, we need to conserve water in our sources including rivers, lakes and groundwater and avoid overstressing the production and distribution systems.Already some areas in Athlone, Kilkenny, Longford and north Dublin have experienced outages and restrictions and areas in Donegal and Mullingar have been identified as being at risk, Ms Gannon said.“Irish Water’s Leakage Reduction Programme teams are on the ground now but we also need the public’s support to reduce their water usage. The top three measures that people can take are not using a hose to water the garden or wash cars keeping paddling pools very shallow if they are being used and taking short showers rather than baths.”"},{"url":null,"title":"military veterans struggling adapt civilian life mods tick box2","story":"digitalservices@telegraphMilitary veterans are struggling to adapt to civilian life, a charity has warned, as former service personnel criticised the Ministry of Defence\u0027s tick-box support. Many working-age service leavers feel “undervalued by society and misunderstood by civilians” with the resettlement process failing to address their lost sense of belonging, the study by Ssafa, the Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen’s Families Association, found..  The charity surveyed over 1,100 former service personnel between the ages of 18 and 49, for a new report titled The Nation’s Duty: Challenging society’s disservice to a new generation of veterans. Over three quarters of those polled (77 per cent) - all of whom had sought help from the charity - said they felt they were not fully prepared for civilian life with 19 per cent saying the resettlement package failed to provide them with suitable skills or qualifications to find a job. Sir Andrew Gregory, SSAFA’s Chief Executive, said: “Support for the Armed Forces means more than just supporting them during active duty, it means creating a welcoming environment for them to re-enter when their time is served.”Sir Stuart Peach has said wider society has too simplistic a view of those that had served their country.The report comes in the wake of comments by the outgoing Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Stuart Peach, who said wider society has too simplistic a view of those that had served their country.“The absolute majority of people who served in the Armed Forces return to fulfilling lives enriched by the experience.

Two other children were able to safely get out of the water on Monday, but the third youngster remains missing. Police have urged people to avoid the temptation to swim in open water in hot weather.Meanwhile, gardeners are being encouraged to “love your brown lawn” and avoid using paddling pools in a bid to preserve water - although utility firms described reserves as “healthy” and promised not to introduce hosepipe bans.Forecasters expect the next few days to be even hotter, with the mercury set to rise to 33C (91.4F) later in the week.It means parts of the UK are currently hotter than Athens in Greece, and on a par with Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Rio in Brazil.The heatwave is set to last until the weekend, when temperatures are due to slowly fall.Buckled rails at Wishaw near Glasgow, as Network Rail\u0026#39s extreme weather action teams are being activated across BritainTransport officials said rails under direct sunshine might reach 20C (68F) above the surrounding air temperature, causing the steel to expand - raising concern that rails will buckle as temperatures soar.It means some routes, such as the line between London Waterloo and New Malden, will be subject to speed restrictions from 11am each day until Friday.Network Rail\u0027s extreme weather action teams are being activated across Britain to monitor vulnerable locations. Andy Thomas, managing director of England and Wales at Network Rail, said: On very sunny days, rails in direct sunshine can be as much as 20C above air temperature, causing the steel to expand markedly, and could - if not carefully monitored and action taken - buckle, causing travel disruption.Our engineers and specialist extreme weather teams are monitoring track-side temperatures at vulnerable locations and will, if necessary, introduce temporary speed restrictions during the hottest part of the day to keep trains running, albeit more slowly than normal.Some sections of rails are painted white so they absorb less heat.Slower trains exert lower forces on the track, reducing the likelihood of buckling.Four areas of England -

We are currently trying to locate the man\u0027s next of kin.The force spokesman gave safety advice for swimming in open water and added that a number of youths had been swimming in the lake and behaving in an anti-social manner.He said: Bodies of water may look safe, but can hide dangers such as hidden currents, hazardous objects, pollution and cold water shock, which affects our ability to swim and reach safety if experiencing difficulties.It can also be difficult to gauge water depth - you could find yourself in unexpectedly deep water or injure yourself jumping into shallow water.Water UK, which represents regional water companies, said heavy rainfall during spring had left aquifer levels robust.However, Anglian Water issued a detailed list of dos and don’ts to prevent waste, including “leaving the sprinkler in the shed this summer”.“Grass is extremely hard to kill - your lawn will soon bounce back and be vibrant and green again,” a spokesman said.They added: “Forget the paddling pool and head to the beach...if you’ve already filled the paddling pool for the day, don’t empty it, you can save loads on your water bill by using gentle disinfectant tablets that keep the paddling pool water fresh for days.”Failing that, Anglsaddlian customers are advised to use the water to “wash the dog”.On Monday, the hottest point of Britain was at Hampton, in London, where temperatures reached 30.1C - making it the hottest day of the year so far.The previous 2018 record was recorded at St James\u0027s Park in central London, which reached 29.1 on April 19.Meanwhile in Scotland, Achnagart in Ross and Cromarty boasted a temperature of 27.5C and the heat hit 25.3C in Castlederg in Co Tyrone, Northern Ireland, on Monday.And high temperatures are expected to be beaten later this week- before dropping off at the weekend.Merseyside is likely to enjoy the hottest weather on Tuesday, the Met Office said, with highs of 31C (87.8F) forecast.Temperatures are set to rise, with a possible high of 33C (91.4F) on Thursday, meteorologist Alex Burkill said, soaring above the UK average for this time of year of 17.3C (63.1F).The fine, hot weather looks set to continue into next month.At the moment it looks like that will be the general theme through much of July, he said. Generally it looks like it will stay drier and warmer than average.Forecasters said the hot weather is being caused by a jet stream looping to the north of the UK which has created an area of high pressure.Click here for more UK weather news.Please review our commenting policyPolio outbreak declared in Papua New GuineaTaliban bomb-maker found guilty of plotting knife attack on MPs and police outside ParliamentAlleged bodyguard of Bin Laden held for deportation in GermanyGPs \u0026#39will go mad\u0026#39 without limits on patient numbers  Transgender woman wins legal fight to force the government to pay her state pension from 60 A47 crash: Bus driver and passenger dead after double decker and lorry collide in CambridgeshirePrince William asked by President of Israel to deliver \u0026#39message of peace\u0026#39 to PalestiniansFrench nanny murder: Couple jailed for life after torturing Sophie Lionnet to death in act of \u0026#39horrible cruelty\u0026#39What causes a heatwave and how hot can we expect it to get this week? Scottish Government accused of failing cancer patients as waiting times hit new lowMoped gang chased by builders down London street after attacking woman and childJohn Bolton heads to Moscow to discuss Trump-Putin meeting - and possible World Cup visit Discovery of earliest European depiction of cockatoo in medieval book rewrites history of global tradeVan driven into front of Dutch newspaper\u0026#39s head officeWorld\u0026#39s first beluga whale sanctuary will re-home animals kept in captivityUnmarked police motorbikes intercept mopeds in ManchesterUS freezes \u0026#39zero tolerance\u0026#39 migrant policy as family detention centres hit capacityWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather railway slowdown stop tracks buckling heatwave set","story":"digitalservices@telegraphRail passengers are being warned of lengthy delays as speed restrictions are enforced to prevent tracks from buckling in a heatwave that has sparked wildfires across parts of Britain - and shows no signs of abating.As scorching temperatures are set to last until the weekend, Network Rail has deployed “extreme weather action teams” in readiness for even warmer conditions following a peak of 30.1C (86.1F) on Monday, which was the hottest day of the year so far.The announcement came as wildfires took hold in parts of northern England and the Met Office issued its first “yellow” health warning for heatwave conditions of 2018 from Tuesday until Thursday evening. In north Staffordshire, a search is continuing for a 13-year-old boy, Ryan Evans, who is missing after being seen in distress in a lake.

raising concern that rails will buckle as temperatures soar.It means some routes, such as the line between London Waterloo and New Malden, will be subject to speed restrictions from 11am each day until Friday.Network Rail\u0027s extreme weather action teams are being activated across Britain to monitor vulnerable locations. Andy Thomas, managing director of England and Wales at Network Rail, said: On very sunny days, rails in direct sunshine can be as much as 20C above air temperature, causing the steel to expand markedly, and could - if not carefully monitored and action taken - buckle, causing travel disruption.Our engineers and specialist extreme weather teams are monitoring track-side temperatures at vulnerable locations and will, if necessary, introduce temporary speed restrictions during the hottest part of the day to keep trains running, albeit more slowly than normal.Some sections of rails are painted white so they absorb less heat.Slower trains exert lower forces on the track, reducing the likelihood of buckling.Four areas of England - the North East, North West, West Midlands and Southwest - are now subject to the Met Office yellow health warning, meaning temperatures are expected to exceed heatwave thresholds, which range from 28C in the North East to 30C in the Southwest.The Met Office said heatwaves can be dangerous for the very young, the elderly or those with chronic diseases.Its warnings mean there is an 80 per cent chance of temperatures that could be a risk to health.Fun in the sun as twins Teddy and Sapphire are pushed along in an inflatable by their grandmother Zuzana Briscoe at Warleigh Weir near BathA cooling dip at Dovestones Reservoir in Saddleworth, Greater ManchesterA man waters flowers in London on Monday as temperatures riseThe yellow health warnings are for heatwave conditions between 9am on Tuesday to 6pm on Thursday. The Local Government Association issued a plea not to neglect the elderly or vulnerable, more than 2,000 of whom died in England during the heatwave of 2003.“The hundreds of deaths caused by temperatures each year are avoidable,” said chairman Izzi Seccombe. “No one is immune to the power of the sun.”The sweltering sunshine sparked a large moor fire in Saddleworth on Monday evening that could be seen 15 miles away in Manchester.Firefighters were still at the scene of the blaze between Stalybridge and Dovestones, which spread overnight.Greater Manchester Fire Service said the blaze had devastated a portion of the area near to Buckton Hill.Giant walls of flames: Firefighters battle a large blaze on Saddleworth moorFirefighters walk across the smouldering Saddleworth moorSaddleworth Moor burns through the night above Mossley and CarrbrookA search has resumed for a missing 13-year-old boy, Ryan Evans, who was seen in distress in a lake.Two other children were able to safely get out of the water as the alarm was raised at about 5pm on Monday, but the third youngster remains unaccounted for.A search involving police ers, the fire brigade and ambulance teams is continuing at Westport Lake.Police officers in a boat searching Westport Lake on Tuesday morningEmergency crews, including paramedics, firefighters and a police helicopter, were called to the scene at around 4.50pm.An air ambulance also attended, but the search was suspended overnight due to fading light.The search of Westport Lake, in Stoke-on-TrentA Staffordshire Police spokesman said: Emergency services are currently at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent to resume the search for a missing child.Staffordshire Police, together with partners including West Midlands Ambulance Service, Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service and specialist underwater teams, will recommence the search shortly.Three children were reportedly in distress in Westport Lake, Stoke-on-TrentThe spokesman added: All families involved are continuing to receive the appropriate support from specially trained officers.If you are visiting the location today, please show respect and allow the emergency services professionals to continue the search uninterrupted.A man has died after he was seen struggling while swimming in a lake in Surrey.

information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is

epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.”415 Wuthering Heights, by Emily Brontë“I have just returned from a visit to my landlord – the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with, which pitches you straight into the story.”515 Middlemarch, by George Eliot“Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.A stronger charge against Orwell might be that of antisemitism.\u0026nbspThe private notebooks that formed the basis of the list he sent to the IRD included labels like “Polish Jew”, “English Jew”, and “Jewess”.But Orwell did also devote an entire 1945 essay to discussing how best to combat antisemitism, while having the honesty to admit – and regret – his own occasional lapses into jokes at the expense of Jews.And at the moment, antisemitism might be a problematic charge for some left wingers to level.Taylor, though, is convinced that some amongst “the newly emergent hard left” would secretly love to unleash something against Orwell.And yes, by “newly emergent hard left”, he does mean some Corbynistas.Younger party members, Taylor concedes, might not have the personal memories of the Cold War, still less an instinctive understanding of the context in which Orwell produced his list in 1949.But, he adds: “I am a Labour Party member.\u0026nbspI have been to hear Corbyn speak and noticed how an awful lot of the people there were aged left wingers for whom there had not really been a place in the Labour Party for the last 20 or 30 years.“An awful lot of the hard left these days would pay lip service to Orwell as a beacon of sanity, while secretly having doubts.“There are still a load of extreme lefties out there to whom Orwell is this snivelling little Trotskyite telling them things they don’t want to hear and pointing out things that shouldn’t be pointed out because they get in the way of the revolution.”And to the ideological, Taylor would add the psychological: “Tall poppy syndrome – Orwell is this secular saint, so let’s have a go at him.”This battle over Orwell’s reputation, of course, is more than just a matter of idle literary historical curiosity.Its relevance to the political struggles of today is suggested by the remark of one of the more ferocious online critics.“George Orwell,” he says, “was the first in a long line of Trots-turned-neocons”.It is certainly true that far-right commentators have started trying to co-opt Orwell to their cause, even to the point of suggesting that the man who once chased a fascist across a battlefield with a fixed bayonet would deplore the Antifa movement.This, says Taylor, is pretty much what Orwell feared.“At the time he was giving Celia Kirwan his list, 1984 was about to be published.\u0026nbspOrwell’s great fear was that right wingers would use it as a piece of anti-communist propaganda, and that’s what happened.\u0026nbspImmediately after\u0026nbsp1984 was published, it was used by the CIA as a propaganda tool.“Orwell wrote a very interesting letter to people in the US saying: ‘Look, this is not so much anti-communist as anti-totalitarian.’“He feared what right wingers would do with 1984, but thought it was the price you had to pay for exposing evils like totalitarianism.“And a writer can’t be blamed for how their books are used by people who are determined to twist meaning for malignant ends.”Taylor, though, can’t help wondering whether Orwell would really have been that upset by the comments of “slightly disconnected people” on the far left of the internet.Orwell himself, he points out, never sought secular saint status.\u0026nbspQuite the reverse: “He was very wary of that kind of thing.\u0026nbspIn an essay on Gandhi he effectively says that when people start being referred to as saints there is something very odd about them and it usually ends in disaster.”Instead Taylor has a sneaking suspicion that Orwell might have been rather amused by his online detractors.“People undervalue Orwell’s wry sense of humour,” he says.\u0026nbsp“David Astor, who used to edit the Observer and employed him, told me about the time Orwell came to him saying, ‘You should hear the abuse I have been getting from some of the communist newspapers.’“Orwell said: ‘They call me a fascist octopus.\u0026nbspThey call me a fascist hyena.“Then he paused: ‘They’re very fond of animals’.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Reports that the Government is set to reject plans for a tidal power lagoon in Swansea Bay have been greeted with anger in Wales.The £1.3bn Swansea Bay tidal lagoon has been rejected by the government, crushing hopes it would spark an “economic revolution” in Wales.Following 18 months of analysis, ministers have decided that the renewable energy project will not receive any subsidy support, despite independent experts stating that it would be a “no regrets policy”.Supporters hoped the initiative could be a pathfinder project that would pave the way for more tidal lagoons across the UK.However, business secretary Greg Clark told the House of Commons the project “however novel and appealing” did not demonstrate value for money for consumers and the general public.A report on the project released in January 2017 concluded that the project would bring huge benefits, and could be a highly cost-effective way of generating electricity.The report stated it was “beyond question” that the local economy would benefit, and that it would be cheaper than offshore wind.However, opponents of the scheme voiced concerns about the affordability of the technology, as well as its impact on the environment.Tidal Lagoon Power – the company behind the development – claimed the tidal lagoon’s turbines would have been capable of powering over 150,000 homes for around 120 years, but was in need of government subsidies similar to those given to nuclear developments to undertake its project.In the proposed development, a large U-shaped wall constructed in Swansea bay would be lined with turbines that generate electricity as they are driven by the rise and fall of the tide.The company claimed the\u0026nbspSwansea project would service more than 150,000 properties and it was cheaper than nuclear power.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe in climate changeA group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, AntarcticaAmid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

Instead of supporting a potential success, the government has decided to continue propping up a failure.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK also buys different goods at a different rate to other countries in the EU.Crackdown on digital campaigning demanded after Brexit allegations Banks lay out plans to move jobs from UK as no-deal Brexit loomsMost Brexit voters would be content with a Northern Irish borderIf Brexit is for the long term, it will unfortunately outlive us allCountries from around the world are expected to use the WTO talks argue that the quotas should be split up in ways that work to their own advantage – to give their own economies an easy boost.They might for instance argue for an interpretation that they believe will allow them to export more product overall, protect one of their industries,\u0026nbspor which might block a competitor from gaining an advantage.In theory this complicated political argument has to take place between the EU, UK, and every country they trade with, on every kind of product they trade with a quota.The talks needed the go-ahead of the EU because until Britain leaves the bloc the European Commission is still its representative in overseas trade matters and the UK cannot negotiate trade deals by itself.The European Council says the talks will be “conducted within a tight timeframe” but says if the withdrawal agreement is finalised then it will roll over its trade deals to apply to the UK until 31 December 2020.\u0026nbspBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Mr Ahmed has not yet blamed anyone for the blast, nor has anyone claimed responsibility, and police are investigating.“Love always wins,” he said. “Killing others is a defeat.

The rally has now broken up with people singing, chanting and going back to their homes. In a cowboy hat and T-shirt, Mr\u0026nbspAhmed had addressed the crowd in Meskel Square as supporters wore clothes displaying his image and carried signs saying “One Love, One Ethiopia”.Mr\u0026nbspAhmed told the tens of thousands of supporters that change was coming after years of anti-government tensions and there was no turning back. “For the past 100 years hate has done a great deal of damage to us,” he said, stressing the need for even more reforms. The 42-year-old entered office in April and went about introducing a swift package of liberalising reforms which surprised Africa’s second most populous country.He announced the release of tens of thousands of prisoners, the opening of state-owned companies to private investment and the unconditional embrace of a peace deal with rival Eritrea. “I’ve never thought this day will come in Ethiopia. I’m very emotional right now,” said Mulugeta Sema, a supporter of Mr\u0026nbspAhmed who wore a T-shirt with the new leader’s image. “We should never get back to dictatorship. This is time for change.” British man held on death row in Ethiopia for four years releasedEthiopia demands Britain return all country’s artefacts held by V\u0026ampAHowever, not everyone has supported the reforms. Some Ethiopians near the border with Eritrea have protested the embrace of the peace deal. Meanwhile, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, the dominant force in Ethiopian government for much of the past 27 years, said the peace deal had been made before the ruling coalition’s congress met to discuss it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, to revolutionise food production in the region, we require long-term solutions through the adoption of innovative and ground-breaking practices.“One such example of this is a particularly valuable effort in Zambia that is being supported by the UK government\u0027s\u0026nbspDepartment for International Development.”The department has invested more than £100m funding research to create super crops\u0026nbspwhich are more nutritious and better resistant to disease with an improved ability to withstand severe flooding or drought.The project shows how the problem of Zambia’s low-yielding agriculture can be mitigated by promoting new super crops.But according to Yousuf, southern African countries also need to “ersify and modernise to tap into their full potential. Super crops are just one piece of the puzzle.“Good farm management, effective irrigation, crop insurance, and the use of crops suited to local climate and conditions are other, vitally important factors.“The efficient production of tea, coffee, sugar, maize and several other cash-crops is reliant on changing farming methods and moving away from rudimentary techniques towards a fully, mechanised approach.”The incentives for African farmers to adopt these new crops are significant given their extensive benefits, as well as their market value given the overwhelming demand on the international market.However, awareness of how to grow and harness these crops is poor and requires significant investment on the side of African governments to train farmers, increase understanding, and support throughout the initial stages of crop development.The combined approach of revolutionising farming methods through mechanisation the appropriate use of fertiliser and pesticides, and the deployment of high-yielding super crops means the future is bright for agriculture in Africa.The next generation of farmers, harnessing the true potential of the land, will not only have the potential to deliver food security but a significant opportunity to prosper economically.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

To participate in the state’s primary you must have registered by 5 June. To vote in partisan races, voters had to register as a Democrat or Republican, but other party affiliated voters can cast ballots in nonpartisan races such as those for school boards.\u0026nbspPolling places can be looked up on the Board of Elections site.\u0026nbspThere are several online voting guides to help familiarise voters with issues before heading into the booth. A valid form of identification is required and can be in the form of a state driver’s license, state issued ID card, passport, student or military ID. A current utility bill or pay stub listing your name and address also works. Those without identification can request a provisional ballot, which will be counted once the information is verified. Incumbent Governor Larry Hogan is running for a second term at the helm this year. Though a Republican, he is considered a moderate and worked to put distance between himself and Donald Trump on issues like healthcare and gun control. His popularity is a pleasant surprise for a state that is considered to be largely Democrat and has voted that way for decades in presidential elections. Going against Mr Hogan are eight Democrats. Perhaps the best-known candidate is Ben Jealous, former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People\u0026nbsp(NAACP). He has managed to get endorsement from Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and is seen as the progressive challenger to established Democrats in the state, part of a national movement this year to make the party more erse, inclusive, and less reliant on corporate contributions which wield influence. However, candidate Rushern Baker polled at a relatively close second. The official from Prince George’s county, which borders the eastern half of Washington DC, has won the endorsement of former Democratic Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley and is seen as having closer ties to the establishment wing of the party. While Maryland is seen as a reliably blue\u0026nbspstate, there is one red\u0026nbspRepublican pocket and Democrats are looking to change that in voting booths along the Eastern Shore part of the state. Andy Harris has been the Republican Representative in the US House for eight years and has not faced a real challenge in that time. Unlike other parts of the state, the Eastern Shore is predominately white and voted for Mr Trump by 29 per cent in the 2016 election. What Mr Harris faces now is not just his vote against Obamacare, and that only 26 per cent of Maryland voters are registered Republicans, but also that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has made his seat a target and throwing political weight behind challengers like Jesse Colvin, a former Army intelligence officer, who has raised a large amount of money. Five other Democrats are challenging Mr Colvin for the nomination.

An existing\u0026nbspstate of emergency, they\u0026nbspstressed, also limited freedom of expression and assembly for political parties.The delegation from the\u0026nbspOrganisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)\u0026nbspcomplained that some monitors were obstructed in carrying out their work. Ignacio\u0026nbspSanchez Amor, the group’s special coordinator, said it was “utterly unacceptable” that two members of the team were denied entry into the country.Election in Turkey: the reaction in picturesSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultMr Erdogan described the election process as “an example to the rest of the world”. In his victory speech he returned to a recurring theme in his campaign: that he was the leader to\u0026nbspstand up for Turkey against western powers. “We never bow down in front of anyone except God, you have given a lesson to those who want for Turkey to kneel,” he told his cheering followers. “We will fight even more with the strength you provided us with this election.”Foreign interference and sabotage had been blamed by Mr Erdogan and his supporters for a range of the country’s ills, including the plummeting national currency, the Lira. The president, who had said he would play a key role in forming economic policy in his new administration, declared that vast infrastructure developments\u0026nbspbeing undertaken will lead to massive boosts in employment and growth. The projects include Kanal Istanbul, a 45 kilometre channel linking the Black and Marmara\u0026nbspseas and the airport to replace Istanbul’s Ataturk, provisionally named the New Istanbul Airport, but, it is claimed in local media, which may end up being called\u0026nbspErdogan Airport.The conflicts\u0026nbspagainst Kurdish militants home and abroad are set to continue,\u0026nbspwith new operations planned. The mission was to “fight terrorist organisations” and\u0026nbsp“to continue the fight to make Syrian grounds freer”, Mr Erdogan said. Fresh offensives are also expected to be launched against Kurdish fighters in the southeast of the country. “Our flag will flutter more freely, the peace of every citizen will be advanced,” the president\u0026nbspsaid. “One nation, one flag, one country, one state.”Erdogan proclaimed winner of Turkey’s presidential electionThe pro-Kurdish\u0026nbspPeoples’\u0026nbspDemocratic Party (HDP)\u0026nbspbroke through the 10 per cent barrier in the elections and so\u0026nbspwill have a significant number of MPs in parliament. Nine of its newly elected MPs, including the leader, Selahattin Demirtas, have been imprisoned.\u0026nbspThe HDP\u0026nbspgains\u0026nbspwere expected to make the opposition groups the majority in parliament,\u0026nbspbut Mr Erdogan’s\u0026nbspJustice and Development Party did better than expected as did its allies, the far-right\u0026nbspNationalist\u0026nbspAction Party\u0026nbspwho secured\u0026nbspdouble the support polls had forecast. This means the ruling coalition will keep control.The election wins\u0026nbspkeep 64-year-old Mr Erdogan in office until 2023, the centenary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. He can then, under the new constitution, run for another term as president, and one more if he were to call an early election. Thus\u0026nbspallowing him to stay president, theoretically, until 2032, easily surpassing the tenure of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.During\u0026nbspthe election campaign Mr Erdogan had mooted that the state of emergency, brought in following the failed coup blamed on exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, would be lifted. More than 50,000 people remain in prison and another 140,000 have been suspended or fired from their jobs.Turkey’s democracy isn’t over yet, but it will be soonErdogan declared winner of Turkey\u0027s presidential electionSix arrested for ‘insulting Erdogan’ as polls open in Turkey electionsThe president has not given a timeframe for the easing of the punitive measures or any indication on whether they would be lifted totally.\u0026nbspHis new powers, in any event, allow\u0026nbsphim to impose draconian measures with minimal interference from the judiciary.There were some among opposition supporters who would rather not wait to see whether there would be an outbreak of benevolence from the president after his victory.Adem Bulent, a 20-year-old student and CHP supporter, said he has begun to explore whether he can finish his studies abroad. It was not just the defeat which disappointed him, but the way the political parties accepted it. “They talked about how unfair it was, they talked about vote rigging, then this happens against all the expectations, and then –\u0026nbspnothing,” he said, waving\u0026nbsphis arms in exasperation. “I think the chance has come and gone, there is no point in pretending otherwise.”The extent of the gloom felt by those who expected change\u0026nbspwas expressed by an academic staring into his coffee on Monday morning at a cafe in Istanbul’s fashionable Nisantasi district. Suleiman had stayed up\u0026nbspmost of the night in front of the television with the forlorn hope of the figures changing. “Just how bad was it? Well let’s say for us it was Trump and Brexit rolled into one, that’s how bad it was,”\u0026nbspwas his damning verdict.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Im assuming thats because there are more foxes out there.Every shot is a head-shot. I dont shoot anywhere else on the body - even though I could kill them, they could run off elsewhere and may not die instantly, he says.Theres a part of the brain called a Medulla Oblongata- its the brain stem. The idea is to shoot at an angle that hits that and cuts their motor.Wherever possible, I shoot from a first-floor window in the house. There was an occasion when the lady didnt want me inside, so she made me sit in a Wendy house, which was a bit embarrassing.Foxes dont have protected legal status, so its not an offence to shoot them - provided you have the landowners permission and the relevant firearms licence.Some other methods of killing, like using poisons, are illegal however.The RSPCA urges homeowners to use non-lethal deterrents instead, claiming that shooting urban foxes does nothing to prevent others from taking their place.Local councils warn that you are responsible for the costs of killing and disposing of a fox if you employ someone to kill one.Even cooped up in a playhouse, Tom would cut an intimidating figure.Youll find him out on a job most nights, armed with his suppressed .22 rimfire rifle - the most popular kind of weapon among recreational shooters and small game hunters - which he carries around London in a nondescript brown tennis bag.He prepares for a shoot by asking his client to smear dog food (supposedly a fox favourite) in their garden at the same place and at the same time, every night for six nights.The prospect of a safe, easy and regular meal is enticing enough to trap any nearby foxes into a predictable routine, helping Tom outsmart his notoriously savvy prey.Then, on the seventh night, he will be waiting in the house, his rifle loaded with bullets which punch effortlessly through fur and bone.As the fox creeps into his line of fire, a muffled, barely audible shot from above will kill it.Its estimated that over 100 fox assassins operate in London alone, with many more in other cities throughout the UK.Bruce Lindsay Smith, 60, is one such marksman with over 40 years experience, and the owner of a pest control business which takes out over 1,500 foxes a year.His record is 33 kills in one night on a golf course, using the same lethal methods as Tom to deliver swift, silenced blows before the fox even knows what hit it.Speaking to The Sun, he said: There are more urban foxes around than I have ever known. People are struggling to cope — they are wrecking gardens, strewing rubbish everywhere and attacking pets.The kindest thing is to shoot them. They don’t know you are there, then are stone-dead.”Rough estimations place the UK fox population at around 450,000, with as many as 150,000 of these living in cities, sustained mostly by food waste from restaurants and takeaways.They make their dens in garden sheds or under decking, and are known for their nightmarish screeching noises - used to confirm their territory and communicate during mating season.And many urban foxes carry parasites like ringworm, fleas, ticks and roundworm, which can be passed on to people or, more likely, pets through their faeces.Its illegal to poison or relocate foxes, leaving Toms controlled, deadly approach as one of the few ways fox populations can be thinned out without breaking the law.He holds a licence for his gun, and always tips off police before a shoot, ensuring he wont end up in a sticky situation if a neighbour sees him brandishing a rifle in a suburban garden.Im not required by law to do that but I think its the right thing to do for safety - not least my own, he says. Walking around London with a rifle, I could be set upon by armed police, so it saves a lot of hassle and a lot of undue attention.Tom calls time on most shoots in the early hours of the morning.With permission, he then takes the bodies to a patch of Sussex farmland and burns them.But with thousands of foxes in every British city, theres no way to make a real dent in their numbers - and theres always the risk that slain foxes in your garden will just be replaced by more.We cant help foxes coming into peoples gardens - its always going to happen, pest controller and military veteran Steve Barron tells Sun Online.Culling foxes doesnt work. However, removing individual foxes that have got over-familiar and are causing issues does work.When a fox is over-familiar with a school, home or construction site, the only way to deal with it is to target the individual foxes that are causing an issue. Theres no physical threat from repellents so theyll just ignore it.Shooting is instantaneous with minimal stress, provided checks are carried out on a regular basis. Its safer and more humane.Its always done as a last resort when we cant stop them from coming in to gardens by addressing the waste management system or carrying out meshing improvements to physically keep them out.Steve has worked as a fox controller since 2002, and he says business has been steady the whole time.He reckons the best way to deal with a back-garden fox infestation is by cutting off their food supply - by keeping bins indoors - or by meshing up your garden so its impossible for a fox to enter.Foxes are extremely athletic, he says. They can easily scale a six-foot fence, and if its not going over it can go under.I help out at private households, commercial buildings, sports facilities and construction sites.Theres no set fee. Its not like going down to Tesco and buying a pint of milk. I have to treat each job on its merits.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’ve far too much to discuss among themselves.”Migration is plunging European politics into crisis again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition is threatening to break apart over the issue.While in Italy, the new government is threatening to close its southern border — blocking migrant rescue ships from landing — and open its northern border, encouraging illegal migrants and asylum seekers to head north to Germany and Sweden.So worried is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that he is hosting a mini-summit tomorrow to try to find a solution to the migrant crisis which can help save Merkel’s political career.It is tempting to look at the EU in crisis and say that is why the UK is leaving. But this crisis is making it more difficult for Britain to get a reasonable Brexit deal.The European Commission is running the Brexit negotiations.Its priority is in defending the theology of the European Union, rather than finding practical solutions. As one leading figure in the Government laments to me, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier “won’t budge off CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) with Northern Ireland stuck in the customs union”.This kind of Canada-style free trade deal is regarded by the Government as inadequate.Mrs May and co have long hoped that the member states, nearly all of whose economies would be hurt by such a limited agreement, would intervene at some point and tell the Commission to engage more constructively with the UK. But this is happening all too rarely.One of the reasons is, in the words of one member of the Brexit inner Cabinet: “Only four national capitals are fully across Brexit.”Many of the countries that are most sympathetic to the UK don’t have the capacity to follow all of the issues concerned.Over the past few years, the key to any deal in Europe has been Merkel. She is not now going to ride to Britain’s rescue— as David Cameron found to his cost in the renegotiation.But the German Chancellor could push the Commission towards a slightly more pragmatic approach.However, she is now trying to keep her own governing coalition together, as well as come up with a deal with the French for eurozone reform, leaving next to no time for Brexit.I am told that when Brexit is discussed in meetings she is “visibly distracted”, turning to aides for advice far more frequently than she does on other issues.This situation is one of the many reasons why the Government should have prepared vigorously for no deal: A credible threat to walk away from the table if the Commission didn’t behave in a reasonable fashion would have got the member states’ attention.But Mrs May now must hope the EU can patch together some deal on migration and that the member states begin thinking seriously about what kind of post-Brexit relationship they want with this country.WHEN the Cabinet gathers at Chequers next month to thrash out the UK’s offer to the EU, one of the most contentious issues will be customs.The Brexit inner Cabinet is split between those who favour a so-called “new customs partnership” (NCP) with the EU – which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs after Brexit, with companies receiving a rebate if their goods stayed in Britain rather than heading to the continent – and those who advocate Max Fac, which would use technology to minimise border checks.Two Cabinet working groups are trying to find a way to make these ideas work. Neither group has had a decisive breakthrough yet. But I am told the Max Fac one is “not a million miles away” from a solution.The challenge for the PM is to make these plans acceptable to her own side, including David Davis and Liam Fox. One Brexit inner Cabinet member tells me: “She’s got to have David and Liam. If she doesn’t have them, then she has no solution.”Both Davis and Fox support the Max Fac option. But there are influential figures in No10 who remain convinced that NCP is the option to go for. They argue only NCP can help deal with the Irish border issue and get the Government through next month’s crucial Commons votes on the customs union. They warn: “No NCP, no Brexit.”The fear among Brexiteers is Mrs May will use this Chequers meeting to try to push through a modified version of NCP. They fear the reason the whole Cabinet will be present on the second day is to give Mrs May the numbers to do this if the Brexit inner Cabinet remains split on the issue.Doing this, though, would be extremely risky. It would leave Mrs May with a policy that neither her Brexit Secretary nor her International Trade Secretary support.THE Chancellor and the Defence Secretary aren’t just split over how much money the military should get, but what it should be spent on, too.One Cabinet ally of Philip Hammond’s complains that Gavin Williamson wants to “spend the money on uniformed officers when he should be spending it on robotics and the like”.Their view is that this would be a better response to the 21st-century security challenges Britain faces.But in truth, Britain needs both conventional and new, hi-tech forces if it is to respond to the variety of threats now out of there. That is why we MUST spend more on defence.Those close to Williamson point out that if the Government doesn’t increase the defence budget, our status as the leading military spender in Europe – upon which so much of our influence in the world depends – will be under threat as the French and the Germans increase their military budgets.NEXT week, Theresa May will give a speech setting out the Government’s post-Brexit industrial strategy.Key to this must be artificial intelligence, an area where we are one of the leading nations in the world.I understand that the importance of maintaining the UK’s edge in AI is what led to Mrs May accepting Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Digital Secretary Matt Hancock’s argument that visa rules for tech entrepreneurs must be relaxed.The countries that succeed at AI will end up defining this century.So any deal with the EU must preserve the UK’s ability to regulate these industries of the future in a way decided by us, not Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is staggering that the ­Government is still undecided on ­fundamental principles.But the Tories’ woes were hugely exacerbated by their election calamity, caused in part by Remainers hoping Labour would betray Brexit.That emboldened diehards in the Lords and Commons — operating alongside the lavishly-funded, slickly orchestrated campaign colluding with Brussels to annul the biggest vote in our history.Meanwhile the national conversation has degenerated into a tsunami of hate, chiefly from sanctimonious Remainers branding Leavers uneducated racists.How much better off we would all now be if on June 24, 2016 they had grudgingly accepted defeat and pledged instead to make the best of Brexit.In fairness, some Remainers did. TV’s Richard Madeley spoke for them recently when he said we now had a duty to see it through in full by leaving the single market and customs union.He was right. To pretend that Brexit can be “softened” to honour the substantial Remain vote — a nightmarish fudge which Boris Johnson warns of today — is simply dishonest. There is leaving and there is remaining. That’s it.Brussels has revelled in Britain tearing itself apart. Now it is sidetracked by its own problems. A deal looks miles off.Theresa May has only one path forward. At next month’s pivotal vote, she must defeat the backbench rebellion hoping to shackle us to a customs union restricting our trading future. That is not Brexit, as voters would quickly realise. It would reignite the Leave ­campaign with unprecedented ferocity.And the PM and her Cabinet must not be derailed by Remain-fanatic businesses muttering about pulling out. Previous such threats have proved bogus, like all those dire economic forecasts.Leaving may not be smooth in the short-term. That must not deter us.When the EU finally realises Brexit in full is inevitable maybe they will stop playing games and agree a deal.But if the Remain resistance succeeds in crippling Brexit, it will bring on chaos.Our current divisions will seem like happy hour. And it will be their fault.HEARTBREAKING, isn’t it, to see Argentina in disarray and the Germans wobbling at the World Cup?

I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that. But she has to be ready to walk away.“I’ve done negotiations in business and that’s what you do. You say, ‘There’s nothing on the table that I can agree to here.

Definitely, a real connection.”Who, of course, apart from Adam, who was going to be trouble from the moment he introduced himself as: “Not the serious man you see on Instagram.”A personal trainer unencumbered then by the flab of self-doubt who’s got a hint of the Blutos about him and flags up the moments he’s about to be cocky by ­saying: “Not being cocky but . . .”You can’t argue with the female ­reaction, though. Kendall, Megan, Rosie and Zara have all fallen for the swaggering great berk and Adam’s dumped all but the last of them with a smirk of self-satisfaction.As a way of endearing yourself to the core audience, it’s not good. As reality TV baddies go, however, he’s gold.It was inevitable then, I suppose, the fun police would also start taking an interest in him.Sure enough, there they were above the caption “Is Adam’s behaviour unacceptable?” on Thursday’s This Morning, where Katie Ghose, from Women’s Aid — who you’d hope had better stuff to do — was claiming: “Adam’s behaviour is a form of emotional abuse.”It didn’t take a genius to make the obvious point here. It took Towie’s Lauren Goodger, who said: “It’s just a TV show” and Adam’s merely taken the ­multiple dating rules at face value.So, if you have a genuine moral objection, take it up with ITV rather than feeding their publicity machine.Personally, I don’t. I have, though, had a nagging sense something was missing from this year’s run and it wasn’t until last week I worked out what it was either. The opposition.Big Brother, which is normally, head-to-head with Love Island, has disappeared and, I can almost guarantee, none of you have noticed or regretted its absence either.So not only has Love Island been funny, entertaining, immune to political correctness and proved a point, it’s removed the pox of Big Brother in the process.And if that isn’t public service broadcasting of the highest order and worthy of a plug, I dunno what is, frankly.The BBC failing to put Mark Lawrenson out of his obvious misery. Gary Lineker using apparently random World Cup trivia to draw attention to his goal-scoring exploits.The main BBC News actually doorstepping Lord Sugar over one stupid bladdy Tweet.This Morning’s Russell Grant spraying his astrological BS all over Love Island with the claim: “Rosie gave way to Adam too quickly ’cos of Mars in Venus and Venus and Leo.”And host Phillip Schofield failing to deliver the very obvious response: “Your head in Uranus.” TIME was, BBC comedy would make fun of Rick from The Young Ones, and all his ridiculous right-on pretensions.These days he’s running the show, in the guise of a man called Shane Allen who, not withstanding a thousand layers of state bureaucracy, has the easiest mission statement in television – make the viewers laugh.Apparently not, though. According to Shane, running BBC comedy these days is about finding “the diversity story”.Which sounds a bit like awarding the World Cup trophy to Switzerland, on the grounds of the squad’s ethnic mix.Except he doesn’t really mean diversity. It’s just those groups the BBC likes that Shane wants to employ, having made it abundantly clear “Oxbridge white blokes”, who’ve punched well above their weight, historically, are no longer required.So, at a stroke, you deny yourself any chance of finding talents and shows as brilliant, era-defining and clever as Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G/Borat), Pete and Dud, Python, Fawlty Towers, Jimmy Carr, Fry \u0026amp Laurie, The Goodies and Not The Nine O’Clock News, while still very much lumbering us with the likes of Mel \u0026amp Sue, Famalam and Tittybangbang.For the privilege of institutionalising this failure and replacing an imagined prejudice with a very real one, I’ve also just learned we pay the BBC’s Head of Comedy £208,000 a year.Laugh?I didn’t.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “What South American country comes first alphabetically?”Mark: “Zimbabwe.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “Beginning with the letter J, what word means liquid extracted from fruit?”Carroll: “Glucose.”Andrew O’Keefe: “What sedimentary rock is an anagram of the word leash?”Karen: “Coal.”And Andrew O’Keefe: “Which wig-shaped New York building was ­constructed in 1902?”Hat: “Trump Tower.”No, but I like the way you’re thinking, Hat.NEXT up from BBC2’s department of really dumb ideas?You take two of the greatest and most original comic talents of the last 30 years, Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse.And send them bloody fishing.A combination which, in terms of things I don’t want to watch, is right up there with Vic Reeves \u0026amp Harry Enfield restoring vintage cars and Mel \u0026amp Sue attempting stand-up comedy.Mind you, the point of Gone Fishing also seemed lost on Bob Mortimer, as he trudged off to a Norfolk lake, angling for tench and asking his new mate: “What do we hope to achieve by the end of this, Paul?”Long pause.“A bit of inner peace?”What’s in it for the viewers became less and less clear as the silent pauses became longer.To the extent that, if you were lucky, Gone Fishing may just have been television to fall asleep to.If you weren’t, the last thing you may ever have heard was Bob asking: “Anything, Paul?”“No. Nothing.”On the plus side, though, corpses will have missed the moment where the BBC suddenly abandoned the fishing trip and, genuinely (I’m not making this bit up) sent Bob and Paul to a local micro-brewery.The resulting p***-up, you might not be wholly surprised to learn, wasn’t particularly well organised.Lee Dixon: “It’s a must-win game and Germany need at least a draw.”Phil Neville: “Mexico thoroughly deserve their 1-0 victory at half time.”Pablo Zabaleta: “At 3-1 down Tunisia need a goal to equalise the game.”Jason Mohammad: “One of the impressive things about Germany, the whole tournament, they were just so German-like.” Compiled by Graham Wray.THIS week’s winner is Sir Reg Holdsworth, in a wig, and Sir Reg Dwight (Elton), in a wig.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These are likely to go unfulfilled, because he flaunts them so crassly.Yet before acknowledging that the Armed Forces need more money, which they do, we should recognise how hard it is to configure

because it is the only peril the public really cares about.It is evident to all save ­disciples of Julian Assange that electronic surveillance through GCHQ, supported by the intelligence services, armed police and military special forces, deserves generous funding, which it nowadays receives.It is much more difficult to identify the appropriate tools with which to equip the Armed Forces to meet the strategic threats, of which Russia ­represents the most obvious.When President Putin favours hybrid warfare embracing covert special forces, fake news, cyber attacks and subversion, are tanks and infantry battalions the appropriate responses?When US backing for Nato is wavering and key nations such as Germany forswear a serious combat capability, alongside what allies can we hope to present a common front?These are big and hard ­questions.A couple of months ago at a round-table dinner, some of Britain’s top generals and ­strategic gurus held forth about the threats as they see them.Afterwards, the former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was among the guests, told me that he had been disappointed by the ­unoriginality of the ideas expressed.Here were the brightest and best in the war studies ­universe, he suggested, still thinking inside the parameters of the familiar, when much that is unfamiliar is evolving all around us.In planning for the future, Army commanders deserve sympathy, because they are compelled to observe ­constraints imposed by public sentimentality, to which ­ministers make obeisance.For instance, the chronically under-recruited Scottish regiments should be reduced, instead of having their ranks filled with Fijians (yes, really), but that is politically unthinkable.Nobody dares to axe a foot guards battalion, because the Guards Division remains a powerful trades union.The Gurkhas, whose infrastructure and dependants’ costs now make them uneconomic, cannot be touched because no minister will risk Joanna ­Lumley once more taking to the streets on their behalf. ­Politicians, in their own defence, are entitled to point out that the leaders of the Armed Forces are often poor judges of strategic planning.The admirals of two decades ago begged, fought and pleaded for the Navy’s two preposterous carriers, which I have compared to the Egyptian pyramids — huge consumers of resources for negligible practical utility.It was always obvious that the F-35 aircraft for which they were designed are properly unaffordable by modern Britain.Beyond being described by Americans as “the planes that ate the Pentagon” because of their fantastic cost, recent assessments show them ­performing poorly in the key ground attack role, as do the RAF’s Typhoons, conceived as high-altitude interceptors.Moreover, it was always plain that almost the entire Royal Navy’s residual strength will be required to escort the carriers on active service, while they are incapable of inshore operation.A strong government and Defence Secretary would mothball the behemoths in a display of courage such as was last shown by Denis Healey in 1968 when he decided to withdraw British forces from east of Suez.Forces need more of almost everythingThey would also scrap the Trident deterrent replacement, again a big willy gesture for a little willy nation, inappropriate to our diminished status in the world.I know almost no one whom I respect in the defence loop — military or civilian — who favours trying to sustain a nuclear capability on the ­Trident scale.More money must be found to recruit, train and exercise a credible Army.The only certainty about ­Britain’s defence needs is that more soldiers are wanted, to meet a range of future threats.Something much more serious than the fanatics of IS could well confront Britain in the coming decades.American military friends often remind me that Britain’s Armed Forces today command respect neither from friends nor foes.I remember General Sir Mike Jackson saying ­ruefully, as head of the Army 12 years ago: “Mass matters, and we don’t have it.”Our rulers may sometimes be forgiven for lying to us, but should never be forgiven for lying to themselves, as ­members of this Government do repeatedly.Bits of Britain’s Armed Forces are still superb, but it will not do for ministers merely to keep reciting the tired mantra about how terrific the SAS is.This is a niche force, no more capable of frightening Russia or China than the England cricket team.Gavin Williamson is dead right, that our Armed Forces need more of almost everything.Such a pity, then, that he himself has no more credibility at Westminster than an England cricket coach.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For example fruits they have collected on the way.Music is very important. There are sound systems in the streets, very often they cross each other and you find yourself listening to dancehall at the same time dub music and both are louder than you can stand sometimes.Jamaica is a factory for the music. Most of people play some instrument or sings dancehall or some type of reggae.True Rastas believes in connection with the universe with all of us.One Rastaman told me, We are all part of one dread."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-former-astronaut-buzz-aldrin_4345828.jpg?20180626043955 ","title":"buzz aldrin sues two of his children and former business manager","story":"Mr Aldrin said in the complaint that despite revoking the power of attorney he had given his son, Andrew Aldrin continued making financial decisions for him.In the lawsuit, he accuses his daughter Janice Aldrin of not acting in his financial interests and conspiracy."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-prince-william-israel_4346189.jpg?20180626135513 ","title":"duke of cambridge in middle east tale of the unexpected for peacemaker prince","story":"\"I would like you to send him a message of peace, and tell him it is about time that we have to find together the way to build confidence as the first step to bring to an end to the tragedy that goes on between us for 120 years.\"Now it was out there it was clear Prince William couldn\u0027t entirely steer away from the subject after such a significant statement from his host.The prince wasn\u0027t straying from the British government\u0027s line.

They didn\u0027t address the problems or find solutions.:: EU leaders hold \u0027frank and open\u0027 talks at emergency migration summitEurope\u0027s migration policy doesn\u0027t work - the asylum burden remains on frontier countries like Italy and Greece to take the strain. And the returns policy doesn\u0027t work - failed asylum seekers (economic migrants) are not being returned home - either because their home country won\u0027t take them or because the EU country they are in fails to deport them often it\u0027s both.So they are left to live in an unpleasant illegal limbo.I am in touch with a number of people who I met through the years as I\u0027ve reported on migration.They have repeatedly been rejected for asylum and yet they are still here, trying again. The \u0027populist\u0027 and anti-establishment governments who secured power because of the 2015 failures have now politicised the issue and are forcing fundamental change.The paradox being that while the optics are of boatloads still arriving, the figures show that arrivals are a fraction of the number they were.This has caused ructions all over the place: :: Germany:: The Italian \u0027populists\u0027France and Italy have been lobbing insults at each other over the migrant issue. It\u0027s extremely unusual for two such central players in the EU to be at loggerheads.It\u0027s a useful demonstration of how the Italian \u0027populists\u0027 roll and it\u0027s playbook-Trump stuff.The two men who call the shots in Rome - Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Miao, the figureheads of the two coalition parties and both now deputy prime ministers - used their vast social media presence to appeal to their support base by denouncing the what they termed the arrogance of the French president (who had dared to suggest that the migration crisis was largely a political row rather than an actual crisis).An aside: Emmanuel Macron cast himself as anti-establishment when he won the presidency just over a year ago (was it only a year ago!?). Now he feels firmly establishment and up against the real mavericks in Italy. :: The migrants on the MedAn ever-growing number of charity rescue ships are stacking up in the Mediterranean with hundreds of rescued migrants on board waiting for a country to accept them.Italy and Malta are essentially playing chicken with them: each country holding the line not accepting the boats until an imminent danger to life forces them to.It\u0027s tough, reckless, maybe even illegal but, frankly, it\u0027s been effective in forcing the issue onto the table at EU level.Italy has made it clear that it isn\u0027t willing to deal with this issue alone.This short film which we made 18 months ago is an attempt to explain what\u0027s happening on the Med - nothing\u0027s changed since we filmed it. Watch it below. The discussion at EU leader level seems to be going round in circles. They are talking this week about issues they were talking about three years ago: \u0027hotspots\u0027 to process asylum seekers, asylum centers outside the EU, beefing up the external borders.There is no single solution and any discussion must begin with an acceptance that you can\u0027t stop migration.

The Dutch Upper House of parliament today passed a bill that has been on the cards since the Lower House approved it in 2016. It will now be illegal to wear a face-covering veil in public buildings, such as schools, government offices and hospitals. The new law bans all face-covering garb, including for instance motor helmets and ski-masks, in public buildings, but not on the street. The law is billed as a way to make schools, hospitals and public transport safer, but critics say its only aim is to get rid of Islamic veils, such as the burqa and niqab. The Dutch government\u0027s main advising body in 2015 said the choice to wear an Islamic veil is protected by the constitutional right to freedom of religion, and that it saw no ground to limit that right.

There’s people living in sheds, there’s people living in tents, people living in trees, people living in forests, it’s everywhere… I’ve seen people jump off buildings because there’s just no way out”.  Our Wigan Pier Project – which launched this week at wiganpierproject – is in Birmingham, listening to the voices of the streets. Since the government’s ‘Welfare Reform’ plans began in 2010, the numbers of homeless people have grown exponentially.  A staggering 9,560 people are homeless in Birmingham. And figures released around the time of our visit showed the rough sleeper count had risen from fewer than 10 a night in 2012 to 55.  In this five minute film, some tell us about the violence they experience. Mark Edwards, 24, says he’s homeless because his parents “don’t want a gay son”. “I’ve been stabbed on the streets, I’ve had my hands stamped on, I got badly stabbed in the face and head by a bottle on the streets,” he says. Mark dreams of being a Deliveroo driver. But after saving for a bike and a phone and some new clothes, he found out drivers need an address. Another homeless man in a wheelchair, says he was abandoned by the military, after being RPGd serving with the American armed forces. But we find hope in the form of the Dissenters, the homeless ‘house band’ of the SIFA Fireside Project and in the words of Ben Rafiqi, a project worker with Inspiration Support.  “Every human being is a diamond in the rough,” Ben says of his homeless clients. “If that person is encouraged rather than condemned and put down, the diamond can come.” He adds: “Inside that person, waiting to come out, is someone amazing”.

But did you know that when he’s not helping under-confident guys sort out their lives - or at least their shampoo -, he’s super interested in British politics? And we’re not just talking a passing interest.  He genuinely seems to understand the technicalities of Brexit more than most people who, I dunno, had a vote in the Referendum.   You see, Jonathan has a podcast called Getting Curious .  In said podcast, he comes up with a subject he’s curious about, and gets an expert to help explain it for half an hour. And the reason it\u0027s so delightful is that he asks really good questions, and unlike many media personalities, he isn\u0027t proud of his own ignorance. And he doesn’t stick to easy subjects, either. The title of the first episode was “What’s the difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims and why don’t they love each other.” Anyway, in April, he tackled the tricky subject of Brexit in the episode “Has Britain screwed itself with Brexit?”, and it turns out he already understood it - and British politics in general - better than most people.  You want proof? Here’s a few choice moments from the show. 1. When he describes the NHS as “kinda fierce”  And goes on to explain how the Brexit vote was partly swung by the Leave campaign making false claims about it. 2. When he compares the Democratic Unionist Party to the ‘tea party’   If your response to that is \u0027who are the tea party?\u0027, you should probably be quite surprised a hairdresser from Illinois has any concept of the DUP .  3. When he refers to “that Jean-Claude guy”  OK, so he doesn’t know Jean-Claude Juncker’s last name, but at least he’s heard of the EU’s chief negotiator. 4. When he talks, in some depth, about the Norway model  Can you talk in any depth about the Norway model? Didn\u0027t think so. 5. The bit where he asks his guest to explain in two sentences ‘what were the troubles, and that whole civil war over?’  OK, so he’s not a huge expert on the political history of Ireland. But at least he has a desire to understand it. He also describes the Republic of Ireland thus: “Ireland is her own thing. She has a gay president, and she’s great.” 6.

Motorists claim they have been slapped with the hefty bill by merely using a gym car park as a passage to get to a social club in Burton - one of only two routes to access the popular sport venue. Parents taking their children to football matches, and even the social club\u0027s chairman have had tickets arrive through their doors demanding money. Matt Seaborn, Washlands Social Club chairman, told the Burton Mail: I had a first ticket in January but I appealed it and got it quashed.  We\u0027ve just been driving through the car park. There\u0027s something not right with the camera system. There are two car park cameras in the Workout Gym car park and on the bridge towards the social club. One is to clock whether cars are actually staying in the gym car park and the other is to recognise whether a vehicle is just passing through to get to the club instead of staying. Father-of-three Simon Rushton was taking his son to a junior football match at the Washlands Social Club back in February when he received an unexpected parking fine 10 days later. He believes the parking camera in The Workout car park picked his vehicle in on the way in but claims the camera on the bridge failed to recognise that he was only passing through.  The 48-year-old said: It\u0027s the camera on the bridge which is the problem, are far as they are concerned I parked there. I went into the car park twice and came out twice, but they only gave me one ticket which was very generous. I put a post on the \u0027Spotted Burton\u0027 Facebook page and had a few replies from others with the same issue. People have even paid the fines just to stop the hassle and threatening letters. I\u0027m still in the appeal process. The appeal has been turned down and then they employ a collections company, they will be knocking on doors soon and then it goes to the courts. Premier Park, the parking company which operate the cameras in The Workout gym car park, said it is unaware of any motorists driving through the site receiving unfair charges.

She began working in the fetish industry in 2009, wanting to make money and be open about her sexuality, and her sessions range from 30 minutes to 12 hours. Realising that she could earn enough from her \u0027talent\u0027 to live on and cover the cost of renting a three-bedroom home and a fetish studio - seeing clients at both - she soon became a dominatrix full-time. She says she is polyamorous - involved with more than one partner - although she is currently in a monogamous relationship with a man. And when she is not working, she is keen to help others.  But in September last year, as she distributed leftover bread from her sister\u0027s wedding to Manhattan\u0027s homeless, she left some beside a sleeping man for the next day\u0027s breakfast when his pit bull dog attacked her. She recalled: “It all happened so fast I can barely remember anything until I went to touch my nose and realised there was nothing there. “Blood was streaming down my face onto the floor and I started shouting for someone to call 911. “Even then, I didn’t blame the dog, he was protecting his space and I shouldn’t have moved into it like I did.”  Rushed to New York’s Bellevue Hospital, during the ambulance ride Kelli started panicking about the state of her face and the impact it could have on her job.  “I worried that my career would be over,” said Kelli. How could I be dominatrix with no nose? Would people want to come to me still?” When Kelli, who had her wound cleaned and was given antibiotics, saw the extent of her injuries in the mirror of the hospital toilet, she was horrified. “I could see almost everything inside my face. I was terrified, she said.  She was offered a choice between having a skin graft from her legs or bottom to help repair her nose, or flap surgery - where the skin would be used from her forehead to cover it while remaining attached. Speaking about how she opted for the flap, she explained: “I was told a skin flap has a lower risk of the repair failing compared with a skin graft. Also, I really didn’t want my butt or legs to be damaged with the skin being taken from there, as well as my face. Four days after the attack, following the first of four operations, Kelli was discharged and wasted no time in getting back to work. “I had bills to pay,” she said. “It wasn’t an option for me to just stay at home. The insurance covered most of my surgeries, but I had my rent to pay, bills and needed food to eat.” Rather than giving her usual thrice nightly sessions however, Kelli did some of her work using video chat. She continued: “I avoided doing too many face-to-face sessions, but I do a lot of work over video call and text, which still meant I was making money.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kfc bringing back one most","story":"NewsKFC is bringing back one of its most popular burgers - and fans are going to love itKFC fans were last able to enjoy the delicious fried chicken treat back in October, and it\u0027s sure to be a massive hit the second time around\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience WriterDaniel Chipperfield20:41, 25 JUN 2018NewsThis is VERY exciting news (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLong gone are the days of just walking into KFC and just ordering a bucket with fries without really thinking about it. While the classic option is still understandably a favourite, the fast-food giant now also serves up a huge variety of other fried-chicken goodness. And now bosses have decided to bring back one of the favourites burgers after a hugely successful limited edition run last year. It has sold out in every country it has every been released in - and it\u0027s easy to see why.  That\u0027s right, the Double Down burger will be back on the KFC menu soon - and fans are going to go wild for it. It was first sold in the UK back in October as a limited-edition treat, but it seems bosses have now decided to bring it back. The unusual burger doesn\u0027t have a bun (who needs those naughty carbs anyway?) and uses two pieces of fried chicken instead, with bacon, cheese and barbecue sauce making up the filling.  The company teased the re-release of the burger in a bizarre Twitter exchange with the digital editor of Birmingham Live news website.       Back in October, when the burger was first released Jack Hinchliffe, director of KFC UK \u0026amp Ireland, said the burger has sold out in every country it has ever been released in. He said: There\u0027s been so much excitement for the Double Down since it first launched to the US in 2010. It\u0027s sold out in every country that it\u0027s been released in. Fandom has gone wild over the past few years on social media, and we\u0027ve even had reports of our customers taking things into their own hands by hacking the menu to create the sandwich.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2d0ee006656-836x564.jpg ","title":"bowmans new dundee united role is vital says boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tManager Csaba Laszlo is delighted Dundee United legend Dave Bowman has agreed to take on the new role of the club’s Scottish scout.It will see ‘Bow’ take on responsibility of identifying players already operating north of the border who could become signing targets for the Tangerines.And during the season he will be the man who makes sure Csaba knows exactly what to expect from future opposition.“I am very happy about Bow’s decision to be our scout. He will look for new players for us and he has experience in this direction, so I know he will recommend the right people,” said Csaba.“He will also look at opposition and this is vital for us. He is very close to the first team and it is an important position.“Paul Sturrock is doing a lot of work, but he will more or less be down in England and Bow will be here as our man on the ground.”Meanwhile, having signed nine players already this summer, the pace of the rebuilding is set to slow, though there will be more new arrivals in the coming weeks.For Csaba it is important that most of the players he wanted were secured in time for pre-season training getting under way on Thursday.“For the pre-season, more or less 90% of the team must be ready,” added Csaba.“You have to prepare the team, so it was important we had made these signings.“The majority of players we wished for and who we talked to are here.”United are still in the market for another central defender, while one more striker could be added to the squad in the coming weeks.That could see a number of trialists joining up for training and possibly even games, though Csaba has decided against arranging a closed-door game in which an entire line-up of players looking to earn a contract would be used.“Maybe there are one or two possibilities for that (trialists), but if you have to go on trial, for me, there is something wrong.“I am not against loan players but they must be one who can help the team and they have to have ambition.”Fans will get their first look at the new signings in a friendly at Brechin on Tuesday week.So far that’s the only pre-season game fixed up, but at least one more is likely to be confirmed soon.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/06/Gjen_Kingsway_Traffic3.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"busy stretch of dundees kingsway to close as pedestrian crossings installed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne of the busiest stretches of road in Dundee is set to close twice in the next two weeks so new pedestrian crossings can be installed.The A90 Kingsway will close eastbound between the Old Glamis Road roundabout and the Forfar Road junction from 7.30pm on Friday until 6.30am next Monday.The dual carriageway will then close in the opposite direction, westbound from Forfar Road to Old Glamis Road, from 7.30pm on Friday July 6 until 6.30am on Monday July 9.During each closure, vehicles will likely be diverted via either Claverhouse Road or Clepington Road.The closures are being instigated by Dundee City Council in order to install new sets of pedestrian crossings that will make getting to and from Caird Park safer for walkers and cyclists.Workers will install Toucan-style crossings, which have wider crossing paths than Pelican or Puffin crossings, along the Kingsway.Council chiefs do not expect the crossings to cause traffic build-ups, as they will only activate when required by crossing pedestrians or cyclists.As revealed by the Tele last year, the council drew up plans to install the crossings at the Kingsway’s junctions with Graham Street and Mains Loan.The plans were made possible by a Scottish Government grant to encourage people to walk and cycle.Severe disruption is expected as a result of each closure, as the road is the main link between the central belt and Aberdeenshire.Analysis from traffic counters operated by the Department for Transport shows that, on average, more than 38,000 vehicles travel eastbound on the road every day.These include more than 28,000 cars, 135 buses, 6,900 light goods vehicles and 2,800 heavy goods vehicles such as articulated lorries.A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “These closures are to facilitate the installation of new dual Toucan crossings linked to Caird Park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b30b38a540e6-e1529933778347.jpg ","title":"dalmation ludo jets out of dundee by plane after family

arrived in Dundee a fortnight ago to be adopted by a local family.But his stay was short-lived, after it emerged a young family member was allergic to dogs.Ludo had been placed with the family by the Dalmatian Adoption Society, based in Gloucester.Sue Bell, of the society, said Ludo arrived in Dundee via a series of car journeys driven by volunteers.But he left in style – after an amateur pilot offered to fly him back to England.Sue said: “Very sadly after Ludo went to live with his new family in Dundee they discovered their little boy was allergic to him and ended up having to use an inhaler.“The family were heartbroken but had no choice other than to put Ludo back up for adoption.“We were delighted when a family in South Wales agreed to adopt Ludo and we again put out an appeal for volunteers to transport Ludo back down south.“That is when our airborne knights in shining armour came to our rescue.”Nick Baker and William Simmonds contacted Sue to offer to fly Ludo back to Gloucester for onward movement to his new home.Amateur pilot and plane owner William said: “I happened to see an old friend, Nick Baker, had posted on the Dalmatian Adoption Society’s Facebook page, in response to an appeal for help.“I had recently seen a post from another pilot who had flown a puppy for re-homing – which triggered the idea that perhaps I could do a similar thing.“After looking into the routes and journey times, I got in touch with Nick and suggested I might be able to do the flying were he to sit in the back and look after Ludo.“He got in touch with Sue and the rest is history.“I am looking to increase my flying experience and intend to complete my commercial pilot licence. These are hours I’d have to fly anyway, so having the ability to help such a worthy cause as part of my hour building is extremely gratifying.”Nick said: “I have a love for dalmatians and DAS do a great job saving dogs and managing to get them re-homed.“I always do my best to help out in any way I can. When I saw a dog needed transport from Scotland to South Wales I offered my help.“Will messaged me regarding the option of flying to reduce the travel time for Ludo.“He has a share in a plane and a love of flying so was willing to do the journey for free.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/04/TRAVEL-Beaches-070558.jpg.jpg ","title":"dont post on facebook that you are on holiday","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTayside Police is urging folk not to post on Facebook that they are on holiday.The force has issued a statement with security advice during the summer.It said: \u0026#8220Consider the information that you post on social media, if you advertise that your home is unoccupied, if you are going on holiday for example, it can be an open invitation for opportunistic thieves.\u0026#8221Residents should also be particularly careful during spells of warm weather, the statement said.It added: \u0026#8220With the temptation to open windows during the summer months or with doors left unlocked whilst you enjoy the garden, thieves may take these opportunities to commit theft.\u0026#8220Electrical items such as televisions, games consoles, tablet computers and mobile telephones are particularly attractive to criminals.\u0026#8220Please make sure that, where possible, you do not leave these items on show for opportunist thieves, who may be window shopping.\u0026#8220If you are going out and you have a house alarm remember to set it and lock doors and windows when you leave.

She is a spirit medium full time.From her studio, Sacred Spirit in Carnoustie, she is able to give messages from those who have passed away to those who were closest to them.Karen has been able to connect to the spirit world her whole life but only began developing the skill about seven years ago.She said: “I really began my development seven years ago when I travelled down south to meet with Tony Stockwell.“He noticed straight away that I had the ability to be a great medium so he became my first teacher.“I then became a guest on the Scottish dates of his tour.“People think that you can either talk to the spirit or you can’t – and while not everyone has the ability to, if you can connect with the spirit world you need to develop your skills and gain understanding of what they are communicating to you.“For instance if a spirit shows me a sandcastle I know that means someone has been married in a castle. However, you need to work at it to be able to gain that understanding.”Whilst Karen appreciates there is now a greater understanding and interest in mediumship, there are people who see it as a “circus act”.Mediums are especially in the spotlight now as it is portrayed on a bigger platform with TV programmes dedicated to the skill.“There is such a big interest in this kind of work that it has become incredibly accessible with people even going live on social media, but I feel that takes away the personal aspect of it.“I try to give very personal details to people so they know I am telling the truth and I am reputable.“I have even been featured in magazines who have done “psychic under the spotlight” tests and gave me full marks for accuracy.“I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to do this job. I get really emotional but you can’t not get emotional!“I have ladies who sit opposite me in a state of grief and I feel anyone who comes to my events or for a one-to-one session is hurting or grieving and I am able to help those people. I am doing this to bring comfort to people and to help heal them and that is really important to me.“I wouldn’t change my ability at all, I love it.”As well as providing spiritual readings Karen also teaches mediumship to those who have the ability.She said: “I can instantly tell if someone is a medium or has the ability to be, I don’t know why, it’s just a connection.“I travel the world teaching mediums and also have regular students here in the studio. About 80% of those students are here because I have picked up that they have the ability.“I also do online teaching, so if anyone believes they could have the ability to reach the spirit world they should get in contact to develop their skill further.”Karen will be on stage at the Whitehall Theatre on Wednesday June 27.Tickets are priced at £16 and can be purchased from the box office.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people pictures thousands gather at park for dundees race for life","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of fundraisers turned up at Camperdown Country Park for a very worthy cause.Race for Life saw women and men of all ages, mostly decked out in pink, as they took part in a 10k run to raise cash for Cancer Research.Running, walking, jogging and even sprinting, more than 2,000 participants took part in the race around the city’s largest public park.There was also a 5k option, with some participants completing the event while twirling 4lb hula hoops – also known as powerhoops – round their waists."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fff717cc5.jpg ","title":"dundee people residents celebrate after saving post office from closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHilltown residents were rejoicing after the community saved the local post office from closure.Following the retirement of the sub-postmistress in 1991, the Post Office announced the branch would be closed.The plans caused an uproar, with residents and councillors all pulling together to oppose the plan, which was finally shelved.Betty Hand, of the Ladywell off-licence, who was a customer of the branch, supplied bottles of bubbly for the celebratory party.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people rubbish effort a good example","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPupils  Barnhill Primary School in Dundee have taken part in a litter pick.Fifteen youngsters took part and collected rubbish from their school grounds and the surrounding area.Councillor Craig Duncan, who also joined in, said the pupils were enthusiastic and that three bags of rubbish – including plastic bottles, crisp packets, sweet wrappers and broken plant pots – were collected.Mr Duncan said: “The kids were cheerful and are all up for doing another one.

line to receive six figures from Celtic when Armstrong completes an expected £6 million switch to English Premier League outfit Southampton this week.It’s because of a sell-on clause from the deal when the Scottish international left Tannadice for Parkhead back at the end of January 2015.Once the £1m plus the Hoops paid for him then is deducted, the cash heading to Tannadice is likely to be between £400,000 and half a million.While that will be more than welcome as United prepare for another money-losing season in the Championship, with the player’s likely move to England coming out of the blue, it is not something they budgeted for.That means the further signings being planned will not be hit by the fact Celtic do not have to pay up straight away and, if they choose, could stagger the payments over two or three years.What the money could become is a nice extra for manager Csaba Laszlo if he makes moves in the transfer market during the January window.Right now he is looking to put the finishing touches to rebuilding a squad that’s already seen eight new first-team players fixed up.He remains in the market for another striker and a central defender, in particular.Potential target Callum Morris completed a moved to second-tier rivals Ross County at the weekend – along with former Tannadice team-mate Keith Watson.Morris was still on a list of possible signings but after securing stopper Frederic Frans earlier this month, a footballing defender is being sought.Former striker David Goodwillie could complete a move from Clyde to Premiership new boys Livingston this week

the case and although he did not name McKinnon, he did mention the period during which his predecessor was in charge at the club.McKinnon, now in charge at United’s Championship rivals Morton, has responded by issuing a statement.“In light of reports in the press this week regarding the signing of players at Dundee United during my period as manager, I feel I have no option other than to clarify the following point,” it read.“I deal in facts only and the fact is that in my time as manager every single player signed was put through a medical by the medical staff at Dundee United.“I am disappointed that I have had to make this statement because although things did not work out the way I would have wished, I left the club on good terms.“I have moved on and my focus is on an exciting new challenge at Morton.”He would make no further comment and it’s understood he now considers the matter closed.United, meanwhile, were back at work on Thursday as pre-season training kicked

I said ‘if you can do it, sign’.“It’s a really good club – even if it’s the rival of my team! I’d prefer if he signed for Dundee but it’s still a good club.“United have got a good goalkeeper in him. He’s massive, really tall and his English is perfect so that won’t be a problem.“He’s good on the ball and can pass well. Even under pressure you can pass him the ball and he can deal with it, he’s calm and experienced. He’s dominant in the box, too, and comes for crosses.“At Vaduz there were two goalkeepers and they switched all the time but I really enjoyed playing when Benjamin was in goal.”Konrad is considering offers from Holland and Germany but says he’d be happy to return to Scotland.“I would go back to Scotland, I really enjoyed my two years there, though I’ve not had any options there. If there was a good offer I would go back.“A year ago at Vaduz we were relegated and weren’t able to go back up last campaign.“We had a poor start to the season with basically a new team. You could compare it to Dundee United’s season in the Championship. There was one team that had a good start and just kept winning.“It was nice in Vaduz, a good place to play. I can’t compare it to Scotland, though.“The fans in Dundee were mad for football and the stadiums were great. I don’t know if the fans in Vaduz and Switzerland don’t like football much but it isn’t the No 1 sport and it was really calm in the stadiums.”That’s something he couldn’t say about derby days in Dundee – some of his best memories of his time at Dens Park.“I had the two best years of my career at Dundee.“The derby win after 10 or 11 years and beating them at home was great.“The first game at Celtic Park was also a good memory. It is a really famous stadium, even in Germany.“All the derby wins were really good experiences and I feel really proud to have been a part of those games.“I like the rivalry in Dundee. It’s not a nasty rivalry compared with some places in Germany, there’s no fighting, but a lot of banter and people have a bit of a laugh about it.“I still keep an eye on Dundee. Unfortunately there are not many players left from when I was there.“Maybe Gowser, Cammy and Craig Wighton. I still speak to Scott Bain and Nick Ross, too.”It was a mixed experience for Konrad working under manager Paul Hartley at Dens Park, however.“Paul Hartley was hard but fair, I would say.“He had his players, his top players who he would speak to all the time.“He wasn’t always easy, sometimes he would shout at me and Luka Tankulic for no reason but it was football, you live with that.\u0026#8220He played me 69 times in two years so I can’t complain.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cheeky-punter-caught-trying-to-get-served-at-beer-festival-using-little-britain-driving-licence","story":"                          A CHEEKY punter was caught trying to use this fake driving licence featuring the face of Little Britain\u0027s Andy Pipkin to get served booze at a beer festival."},{"url":null,"title":"astonishing-moment-six-year-old-produces-inch-perfect-strike-in-top-bin","story":"                          THIS is the astonishing moment a six-year-old produces an inch-perfect wonder strike while brushing up on her shooting skills in her back garden at home."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7883429.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"adorable-moment-young-boy-realises-animals-go-into-meat-and-turns-vegetarian","story":"                          THIS adorable video shows the moment a five-year-old boy realises that animals are turned into meat -

Ewing, has now spoken out in support of the Transport (Scotland) Bill which is currently making its way through Holyrood, saying it promises \"radical measures\" to improve accessibility and prohibit obstructive parking.\"Inconsistent and obstructive parking is a nuisance in our communities and greatly impacts on our ability to easily get around by foot, and so it is critical we empower local authorities to tackle this important issue,\" he said.Today a coalition of disability and mobility organisations called on Highland Council to develop an Inverness Street Charter, setting out measures to improve accessibility.Produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in liaison with Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and Highland Cycle Campaign among others their \"manifesto\" \u0026ndash Putting Inverness Streets Ahead \u0026ndash identifies pavement parking along with other issues such as street clutter and shared spaces for vehicles and pedestrians as restricting safe access.RNIB campaigns manager Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"Elsewhere, after wheelchair user David Sansum, from Kinmylies, branded the parking situation in Inverness \"a nightmare\" in last week\u0027 HN others have taken to social media to share their own frustrations.On Facebook Paul Tuthill said: \"As a powerchair user I find this

claimed that in some instances, drivers were forced to park on pavements by the lack of any alternative.He said that it is often impossible to find a space and blamed Highland Council for not providing parking as part of new residential developments.Speaking about the situation in his own street he said: \"I may also add everyone parks on one side of the pavement, leaving the other side clear at all times.\"A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Regardless of whether parking provision is made for any property development this does not give motorists the right to park on pavements

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality

welcoming to everyone \u0026ndash and the key to inclusivity is physical accessibility.\"She added: \"A Street Charter would help to avoid entrenching flawed designs that could blemish Inverness for a generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city

buildings","story":"\u0026nbspURGENT action is needed to prevent people from being injured or killed by debris falling from crumbling Inverness buildings, according to a former city provost.Councillor Jimmy Gray spoke out in support of Labour colleague and MSP David Stewart who is pressing for a new law compelling property owners to safely maintain their properties.Mr Stewart is contacting Highland Council chiefs to discuss his idea of regular surveys to gauge wear and tear, and to make owners carry out essential repairs.His proposal comes just a week after two people narrowly avoided being struck by falling debris in the city centre as Storm Hector hit.Earlier this year an apprentice stonemason also prevented another potential disaster when he spotted a masonry block hanging loose over Academy Street, apparently pulled loose by a banner attached to it.This week the Inverness Townscape Heritage project launched a new maintenance guide for owners of traditional properties, setting out key areas for them to consider, including the benefits of regular inspections.However Cllr Gray suggested a far tougher approach may be necessary.\"We cannot wait until there are serious injuries or deaths before stronger action is taken,\" he said.\"I\u0026rsquove been concerned for some time about the condition of buildings not only in Inverness but across Highland.\"We\u0026rsquove spent years trying to persuade owners of buildings to act responsibly. It hasn\u0026rsquot worked. We need to bring about a cultural change whereby owners take greater care and pride in their properties.\"I believe this will need to be supported by legislation which makes it compulsory for buildings to be checked regularly.\"He suggested surveys every three years, adding: \"We\u0026rsquove spent years in and around Inverness trying to persuade the owners of buildings to act responsibly and it hasn\u0026rsquot worked.\"\u0026nbspHighlands and Islands MSP Mr Stewart was successful in having legislation revised four years ago to allow local authorities to recoup money they spend on serving notices or for work carried out if a building is deemed dangerous.In January, kiltmakers Duncan Chisholm and Sons in Castle Street was served with a dangerous buildings notice by Highland Council and the local authority appointed contractors to make the building safe. It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs. But a crisis incident could not only injure people but affect their insurance and their reputation.\"A council spokeswoman said: \"We regularly remind building owners that the responsibility for ensuring the safety of members of the public in and around their buildings lies with them \u0026ndash whether commercial, retail, business, public or privately owned.\"The new maintenance guide can be downloaded at https://academystreet.org/Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 3:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"042ex2606eea_story__9","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew signing Chris Forrester was today challenged to rediscover the form that made him the hottest prospect in the League of Ireland.Such was Forrester’s potential Dons boss Derek McInnes attempted to sign him more than four years ago.Ultimately Aberdeen lost out on the playmaking midfielder because they could not afford the transfer fee wanted by St Patrick’s Athletic.Forrester helped St Pat’s win the top-flight title before transferring to Peterborough United in League One for an undisclosed fee in 2015.Following Peterborough’s decision to transfer list Forrester this season, McInnes moved to finally secure his man for £200,000 in a deal until summer 2021.Forrester is back in his home country Republic of Ireland with the Dons at a pre-season training camp in Cork.He is set to make his debut in a friendly against Cobh Ramblers on Saturday.It is a long-awaited appearance in a Dons shirt McInnes hoped would materialise back in 2014.Forrester underlined his potential by scoring for St Pat’s in a 2-2 friendly draw with Aberdeen in Dublin in July 2014. But McInnes had made a move before then. He said: “I knew about Chris back then (July 2014) because I had been speaking to his agent.“We were well aware that Chris was making headlines in the League of Ireland and was having that exposure. He was seen as the next one that was going to come across the water and get a transfer.“We looked at Chris then and liked him but couldn’t afford the transfer fee that eventually took him away.“We had been well aware of Chris before we played St Pat’s in that friendly.”In his first season in England the 25-year-old midfielder was a stand-out for Peterborough and forced his way into the Republic of Ireland squad.He received a first international call-up in March 2016 for friendlies against Switzerland and Slovakia as part of the Euro 2016 build-up.Forrester has yet to be capped. But his form saw him appointed Peterborough captain.Following Forrester’s impressive performance in a 4-1 FA Cup defeat to Premier League Chelsea in January 2017, Posh owner Darragh MacAnthony insisted the midfielder “would go on to be sold for millions and millions”.Less than 18 months later McInnes swooped to secure him for £200,000.Now the Reds boss has urged Forrester to not only recreate that form that saw Peterborough rate him at around £4m. He also wants the Dubliner to produce the strongest season of his career to date, starting with the Europa League second qualifying round clash against Premier League Burnley next month.On the multi-million price tag of 2017, McInnes said: “He has found himself in a place where he is not that at the minute.“Chris had been playing a different type of role and had found himself a wee bit out of favour there (at Peterborough).“That can happen sometimes with a player.“I am hoping Chris sees this season as going to be the best of his career so far.“If he can get to what we think he is capable of then we have a very good player in the squad.“One who is capable of helping us.”Forrester is one of three midfielders signed by McInnes in what will be a busy summer transfer window. Another Dubliner, Stephen Gleeson, penned a two-year deal.Republic of Ireland international Gleeson, 29, was a free agent having left Ipswich at the end of last season. Also secured was 18-year-old Lewis Ferguson from Hamilton.The Scots clubs have failed to agree a training compensation package for Hamilton and it is set to go to a tribunal to decide the fee.McInnes and Aberdeen are confident they have done their due diligence and the tribunal will reach a fee closer to their valuation than Accies.The Dons initially offered in excess of £100,000 with Hamilton understood to be seeking around £900,000.All three new signings are with the Dons at their training camp at Fota Island Resort in Cork.McInnes said: “Midfield was an area of the team that needed addressed. We have brought in three players at different stages of their careers.“However, they have all came in with the same intention of progressing their own careers and helping us at the same time.“They all have their own qualities to show and I am sure they will do that in an Aberdeen shirt.”McInnes aims to secure further signings before facing Burnley in Europe.He aims to sign another defender, ideally a full-back.Despite already signing three midfielders McInnes remained keen on securing Hibs’ Dylan McGeouch.The Reds had offered the Scotland international the chance to become the club’s top earner should he opt to move to Pittodrie. However, they look set to lose out in the race for McGeouch, whose Easter Road contract expires at the end of the month. The 25-year-old has held talks with Sunderland.Rangers, Fulham and Blackburn are also interested in the midfielder.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"5ive to perform exclusive gig in aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHit \u0026#821790s boyband 5ive are to perform an exclusive gig in Aberdeen.The band \u0026#8211 best known for hits Keep On Movin\u0026#8217, When the Lights Go Out and Everybody Get Up \u0026#8211 will perform at Mecca Aberdeen on August 31.The boy band split in 2001, but reformed with three members in 2012 and toured for two years.Tickets to see Ritchie Neville, Sean Conlon and Scott Robinson are available from £10.Paul MacPhee, general manager at Mecca Aberdeen, said: “We are so excited to watch 5ive perform here at Mecca Aberdeen.“We’re expecting a fantastic evening with hundreds of fans dancing along and playing bingo at the same time.”All tickets can be purchased at the club.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen ice rink to close for repairs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA popular ice rink is to close for a month while repair work is carried out.Sport Aberdeen announced the Linx Ice Arena will be shut for four weeks starting next month in order to fix a “long-standing” issue at the rink.The £27,000 work is on the refrigation plant that keeps the temperature low to freeze the ice.Work will begin on July 23, with Sport Aberdeen expected to reopen the venue on August 20.The arena is home to three ice hockey clubs and has youngsters taking part in figure skating and synchronised skating.The home games of the Aberdeen Lynx Ice Hockey Club are also played at the venue.The club usually gets its season under way at the beginning of September.Director of operations and asset development Keith Gerrard said: “Sport Aberdeen can confirm investment in essential maintenance at the Linx Ice Arena affecting the refrigeration plant.“Work is being done to repair an essential part of the refrig-eration plant which ensures that the brine contained within under-ground pipes can be kept at a constantly low temperature to freeze the ice.

the first time in more than 70 years.It has sat in the archive of Aberdeen University since it was donated in 1942.The “net suit” was used in Angola and Namibia during celebrations of boys becoming men.Children would be taken away from their communities by elders, and trained in practical, religious and spiritual practices for between three and six months in a process called Mukanda.Sisters Diana and Antoinette Powell-Cotton, from Kent, made a two-year trip to Angola and Namibia, recovering 3,000 pieces, 130 of which were donated to the university.After more than 70 years in storage, the suit and a number of other artefacts will now be on display as part of an exhibition on growing up around the world.Rachel Rydquist, a museum studies student at the university, said: “By the time the sisters came back, it was the middle of the Second World War, and they were drafted in to be nurses in London.“So there’s a bit of a lack of information about it, because they were tied up with the war.“I don’t believe that it’s been put on display.“There’s so much stuff in the university collection, and it might just not have been a fit for any of the exhibits that were being done.”She added: “It’s also really difficult to put something out when there’s not a lot of information on it.”Rachel had taken the lead on researching the suit before it was put on display in the exhibition.The new project, which opened earlier this month in the King’s Museum, is to commemorate the Scottish Government’s Year of Young People.The exhibit, called Growing up: Different Journeys, is split into four sections – rites of passage, which the net suit is a part of, education, disruption and stories.According to Rachel, the exhibit aims to explore not only how different cultures experience growing up, but also the universal nature of becoming an adult.She said: “We thought it would be fitting in the Year of Young People, and to have artefacts that show the process across the world.”The exhibit will be open in the King’s Museum until November 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/rabbitnew-857x564.jpg ","title":"north east mechanic finds live

furry friend has appealed to the public to find Derek’s owner.Dave Gordon, 27, said: “It’s not uncommon to find animals stuck in cars, but usually it’s because they’ve met a grisly end.”Dave, who has been a mechanic for 10 years, said: “I’ve seen plenty of rabbits and birds stuck in cars, but never a live one.“Nobody in the garage has ever seen anything like it.”It was only when Dave and the other mechanics were preparing to work on the car that the big-eared stowaway was discovered.Dave said: “The car was brought in for its MOT and I pulled it up on to the ramp.“I started to check it over when I spotted a white shape tucked away behind the radiator grill and licence plate.“At first I thought the owner had hit a rabbit.“I got my torch out and noticed it was still breathing, so I took the front bumper apart to get it out.”Derek is now settling into his new surroundings, but where he came from remains a mystery.Dave doesn’t even know if the bunny is a pampered pet or a wild animal.

Made up of five people, including the driver, they worked in pairs and took turns to load large wheelie bins with sands.The bins were pushed 50 metres to a waiting truck, which was used to empty it, before the bins were taken back to the starting line in a series of timed heats.As well as the entry fee going to Alzheimer Scotland, members also set up a fundraising page – with £1,480 already raised.Money will be split between Inverurie food bank, CLAN, Willows Animal Sanctuary, Doddie Weir Foundation and Friends of the Special Nursery.There will be a further event on June 29 at Inverurie Golf Club to boost the cash already gathered.As well as supporting the north-east, the team said they were proud to represent all waste sector workers across Scotland.Team member Gemma Rosie, who came up with the idea to take part, said: “Everybody who has supported Scaffies on Tour to date cannot be thanked enough for all their support.

He is trying to raise awareness of the need for these two groups to be brought together.In his words: “It’s not that these people are not out there, they just don’t know who to get in touch with.”His running partner is Leona, who has Usher syndrome.Ben said: “I’d been a runner for 10 years and I was looking to do something to help others but that also fit into my lifestyle.“When I watched the London Marathon in 2017 I saw people guiding and thought it would be a good thing to get into. But when I tried googling information that’s when I realised there is a shortage of it in Scotland, which spurred me on to create the group.“I initially got in touch with North East Sensory Services (NESS), who paired me up with Leona.“She needed a new guide for last year’s Great Aberdeen Run half marathon.“She’s a really strong-willed individual and has done things like climbing Kilimanjaro.“Talking to her she said: ‘This is something we need in the north-east.’”Ben, through the Granite City Guide Running Facebook page and his sessions, is now trying to expose as many people as possible to what guide running entails and how to get started.However, because of Disclosure Scotland legislation designed to protect vulnerable groups, Ben can’t personally introduce prospective guides with sensory-impaired runners.He aims to do this by eventually becoming affiliated with, for example, Grampian Disability Sport.He said: “I’m a point of contact, to find out about guide running and how to get involved.“The long-term aim is to connect people who want to guide with people who need a guide.“At the moment the page is for advice, information and I put on classes (to demonstrate).“I can then put people in touch with NESS or Grampian Disability Sport (who can partner people up).”Ben wants bodies like Scottishathletics and Scottish Disability Sport to make it easier to partner guides and runners, and he’s building evidence to show there is real demand for it. He added: “One thing I am doing is keeping a record of the people who want to guide and the people who need a guide.“So I can go to Scottish Disability Sport and say: ‘you’ve got X amount of people in the north-east alone who want and need this’.“The Facebook page has 170 people who’ve shown an interest.“I’ve had close to 50 people contact me directly saying they want to be guide runners.“There’s been at least a dozen or so (sensory impaired) people who have said this is something they’d look for.”Ben’s next challenge is to get as many people as possible to join him and Leona in taking part in the Great Aberdeen Run. He’s even encouraging non-sensory-impaired pairs to try using a blindfold to understand the challenges a sensory impairment creates.For more information, visit Granite City Guide Running on Facebook.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"line-up-unveiled-for-16th-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"NOW in its 16th year, Innerleithen Music Festival is gearing up for another feast of entertainment later this summer.\nAlways a hit with locals and visitors alike, this year promises to be another super showcase of, not only musical talent, but with other dance and drama events and for the first time ever \u0026ndash an art exhibition.\nFestival-goers can expect the usual great atmosphere and live music from local talent at the Live and Local event in the Vale Of Leithen Social Club throughout the weekend of August 17 to 19.\nHeadliners are soon to be announced, but firm favourites such as Unfinished Business, The IV Drips and Cameron Boak will all be there for your entertainment.\nThis event is Free all weekend and more details will be posted, including the full line up on the Live and Local facebook page.\nThe Friday evening kicks off with Act!

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"keep-calm-its-only-the-common-riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"casting-their-places-in-history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new-route-planned-for-tonights-melrosians-rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united-front-to-boost-the-borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

I lost my job, home, income and pension.\n\u0026ldquoMy homosexual conviction and \u0026lsquodischarge with disgrace\u0026rsquo made it very difficult to get another job.\n\u0026ldquoI was near unemployable and was forced to do mediocre, low-paid jobs for three decades.\n\u0026ldquoIt caused me severe depression and ruined my life.\nMr Tatchell said an estimated 10-20,000 homosexual men still alive in the UK deserve an apology and compensation for convictions under anti-gay laws which have since been repealed.\nThe report presented to Cabinet on Tuesday by equalities minister Penny Mordaunt includes a survey of modern-day LGBT individuals of their experiences of life in the UK.\nMrs May told senior ministers that the UK could be \u0026ldquoproud of being \u0026ldquoa world

issue.\nThe action plan will be published ahead of the annual Pride celebrations in London on July 7.\nAmnesty International\u0026rsquos director for Northern Ireland, Patrick Corrigan, urged Mrs May to use the action plan to end marriage inequality in the six counties.\n\u0026ldquoAt a time when there has been no devolved government in Northern Ireland for 18 months, responsibility for ending

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees.

Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-hosts-world-record-attempt-for-the-slosh-dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"calls-to-tackle-edinburgh-bypass-gridlock-as-tram-system-to-musselburgh-mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week.

These machines reward people for recycling by providing money or vouchers in return for empty containers.  Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.  The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.  They come ahead of the expected launch of a national deposit return scheme to which the Scottish, UK and Welsh Governments have all announced their commitment in principle.  The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.  Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis reverse vending machine will provide valuable evidence on how to help reduce single-use plastic waste and encourage customers to change their own behaviour as we look to end Scotland\u0026rsquos throwaway culture.  \u0026ldquoI would urge all manufactures and retailers to follow Iceland\u0026rsquos example and consider what action they can take to reduce the use of single-use plastics.  \u0026ldquoIn the coming months the Scottish Government will be consulting on a new deposit return scheme for drinks containers that will be one step to increase recycling rates right across Scotland.  \u0026ldquoAs part of our action to reduce the blight of waste littering our communities and polluting our seas we are also consulting on proposals to ban the manufacture and sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds and have appointed an expert panel to consider what further steps can be taken on items like plastic straws and disposable cups."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959630.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"future-of-the-hollies-day-centre-safeguarded","story":"              THE future of the Hollies Day Centre at its present location in Musselburgh has been safeguarded.  It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.  Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.  A spokesman for SEPA added: \u0026ldquoEvery day SEPA works to protect and enhance Scotland\u0026rsquos environment and we are clear that compliance is non-negotiable.  \u0026ldquoIn response to local complaints, SEPA officers responded to reports of significant dust in the Dunbar area.  \u0026ldquoOfficers identified the source of the dust and are working with Tarmac to prevent a re-occurrence.  \u0026ldquoWe would advise members of the public to contact our 24-hour pollution hotline on 0800 807060 to report pollution events.

It comes after the largest survey anywhere in the world of their experiences was carried out.  Theresa May told Cabinet that the findings of the survey, in which more than 108,000 LGBT people participated, showed that there was \u0026ldquomore to do to ensure the UK is a country where \u0026ldquono-one feels the need to hide who they are.  The survey was presented to Cabinet as campaigners called on the Prime Minister to compensate up to 20,000 gay men who were convicted over sexual behaviour which is no longer a crime.  The great-niece of Bletchley Park code-breaker Alan Turing was joining Labour peer Lord Cashman and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell to hand in a letter requesting compensation at 10 Downing Street.  Rachel Barnes, whose great-uncle was granted a posthumous pardon in 2013 for his prosecution for homosexual acts in the 1950s, said she was sure Turing would want other gay men to receive compensation for their suffering.  \u0026ldquoThey deserve recompense for unjust imprisonment and fines, physical hardship, mental trauma and often impoverishment, said Ms Barnes.  \u0026ldquoNo money can ever reverse lost and damaged lives but as a symbolic gesture compensation is important and the right thing to do.  Former Royal Fusilier Stephen Close, who was convicted of consenting sex with another soldier at the age of 20 in 1983, was also among those handing in the letter.  Homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967 but remained an offence while serving with the armed forces until 1991.  Around 100,000 men were convicted of consenting adult same-sex behaviour following the outlawing in 1885 of all homosexual acts with at least 15,000 of these men being convicted after the Sexual Offences Act was legislated in 1967.  Mr Close said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI was sentenced to six months in a military prison. I lost my job, home, income and pension.  \u0026ldquoMy homosexual conviction and \u0026lsquodischarge with disgrace\u0026rsquo made it very difficult to get another job.  \u0026ldquoI was near unemployable and was forced to do mediocre, low-paid jobs for three decades.  \u0026ldquoIt caused me severe depression and ruined my life.  Mr Tatchell said an estimated 10-20,000 homosexual men still alive in the UK deserve an apology and compensation for convictions under anti-gay laws which have since been repealed.  The report presented to Cabinet on Tuesday by equalities minister Penny Mordaunt includes a survey of modern-day LGBT individuals of their experiences of life in the UK.  Mrs May told senior ministers that the UK could be \u0026ldquoproud of being \u0026ldquoa world leader in advancing LGBT rights and had achieved \u0026ldquosignificant progress over recent years, said the PM\u0026rsquos official spokesman.  But she added: \u0026ldquoThe survey results show we have more to do to improve the lives of LGBT people and make this a country where no-one feels they need to hide who they are.  She told all Cabinet minister to work with Ms Mordaunt on the issue.  The action plan will be published ahead of the annual Pride celebrations in London on July 7.  Amnesty International\u0026rsquos director for Northern Ireland, Patrick Corrigan, urged Mrs May to use the action plan to end marriage inequality in the six counties.  \u0026ldquoAt a time when there has been no devolved government in Northern Ireland for 18 months, responsibility for ending discrimination against LGBT people in Northern Ireland rests with the UK Government, said Mr Corrigan.  \u0026ldquoTheresa May has stated this action plan will make the UK a country \u0026lsquowhere no-one feels the need to hide who they are or who they love\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThis action plan is an opportunity for her to prove her LGBT credentials and we urge her to act."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7978224.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"former-detective-brands-bulmers-burglary-trial-completely-wrong","story":"              A retired detective has slammed a criminal trial in connection with a multimillion-pound raid at a cider-making family\u0026rsquos home as completely wrong.  Former detective chief inspector Charles Hill was contacted by Esmond Bulmer following a \u0026pound2 million burglary at his home in Bruton, Somerset, in March 2009.  Fifteen paintings and a safe containing \u0026pound400,000 worth of jewellery was taken from the home of Mr Bulmer, of the Bulmers cider family, while he was away in Barbados with his wife Susie.  The couple\u0026rsquos housesitter, Deborah Barnjum, was hooded and tied to a banister by balaclava-clad burglars who entered the sprawling property, known as the Pavilions, at about 10pm on March 20.  She was left painfully restrained after the burglars drove away in two cars, including Mr Bulmer\u0026rsquos Mercedes, and was only discovered 18 hours later.  Eleven men, including two builders who worked at the Pavilions, are now on trial at Bristol Crown Court in connection with the burglary and an alleged subsequent insurance fraud.  Mr Hill, who worked with the politan Police for 20 years, told the jury he had spoken to police and prosecutors before giving evidence in the case.  \u0026ldquoI said conspiracy theories, such as the one that has been brought against these defendants, are wrong, he said.  \u0026ldquoThe focus of this case should be on the assault and torture of the lady who was attached to the banister of the Pavilions, the Bulmer\u0026rsquos house.  \u0026ldquoThat should be the focus of this \u0026ndash not some insurance fraud. That is completely wrong.  Mr Hill retired from Scotland Yard in 1997 and subsequently became a freelance art recovery specialist.  He is credited with helping to recover Edvard Munch\u0026rsquos The Scream after it was stolen in 1994, as well as other famous artworks.  In 2009, he was contacted by Mr Bulmer, a former MP, asking for help in recovering the stolen paintings after police said their inquiries had come to nothing.  Mr Hill was unable to take on the case, so put Mr Bulmer in touch with art detective Richard Ellis, a former colleague in the Met Police.  Mr Ellis arranged for an advert offering a \u0026pound50,000 reward for the safe return of the paintings to be placed in the Antiques Trade Gazette in February 2015.  Months later, Mr Hill was contacted by a man named Jonathan Rees, who claimed to know former members of the SAS that could recover the paintings.  Following negotiations with Rees, who is now on trial for insurance fraud and perverting the course of justice, the reward was raised to \u0026pound175,000.  All bar one of the paintings \u0026ndash Afterglow, Taplow by John Lavery \u0026ndash were returned to a secure location in London in August 2015.  Mr Hill said he believed Rees, who he is still working with to recover stolen artwork, was properly acting as an \u0026ldquoagent of Mr Bulmer.  \u0026ldquoEsmond Bulmer had every right to get his property back under English common law and he could appoint agents in this case, he said.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a good likelihood he [Rees] has done nothing wrong.  Mr Hill said he, Mr Ellis and Rees had acted in good faith and \u0026ldquodone the right things when they worked to recover Mr Bulmer\u0026rsquos stolen paintings.  Following Rees\u0026rsquos arrest, Mr Hill sent a letter to the chief constable of Avon and Somerset Police asking for Rees\u0026rsquos bail conditions to be varied so they could contact each other.  He wrote that it was in the public interest for artworks to be recovered and said he was using information Rees had provided to solve antique crimes across the world.  In evidence to the jury, Mr Hill likened Rees to Winston Wolfe from Pulp Fiction \u0026ndash a \u0026ldquoMr Fixer kind of guy.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom prepared to stand here today because Jonathan Rees has been charged.  \u0026ldquoI think the charges he faces are both outrageous and wrong. There are good officers in Avon and Somerset Police \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos one in court today.  \u0026ldquoI will tell you straight that the block of them, particularly at the higher level, are incompetent and the trial here is their attempt to make amends.  Mr Hill claimed the police had made a \u0026ldquodisgraceful insinuation about Mrs at the time of the raid.  \u0026ldquoThey thought she was a posho and she should be claiming on the insurance, he told the jury.  Skinder Ali, 39, of no fixed address, Liam Judge, 42, and Matthew Evans, 41, both of Tuffley, Gloucestershire, deny conspiracy to commit burglary.  Ali, Mark Regan, 46, of no fixed address, Thomas Lynch, 43, of Small Heath, Birmingham, Donald Maliska, 63, of Dartford, David Price, 53, of Virginia Court, London, and Ike Obiamwie, 55, of Ealing, London, deny conspiracy to handle stolen goods, namely 15 paintings.  Maliska, Price, Obiamwie and Rees, of Weybridge, Surrey, deny conspiracy to defraud James Esmond Bulmer and Hiscox Insurance.  Nigel Blackburn, 60, of Hockley, Birmingham, and Azhar Mir, 65, of Solihull, deny entering into or becoming concerned in a money-laundering arrangement.  Rees denies doing acts tending and intended to pervert the course of justice.  The trial continues."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7978225.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"psni-chief-delighted-to-see-deputy-become-garda-commissioner","story":"              The head of Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos police force said he is \u0026ldquodelighted his deputy Drew Harris has been appointed the new Garda Commissioner.

Homeless social enterprise Social Bite\u0026rsquos Sleep in the Park will again take place in Edinburgh, as well as Dundee and Aberdeen on the same night.  The inaugural event on December 9, 2017 saw 8,000 people sleep under the stars on the coldest night of the year on the capital\u0026rsquos West Princes Street Gardens.  The night became the world\u0026rsquos largest ever event of its kind.  Building on the momentum of that event, Sleep in the Park 2018 will hit Glasgow with the venue expected to be the Kelvingrove Bandstand.  Participants will be joined by an impressive lineup of artists before bedding down for a cold night in each city.  Returning for the second year, Amy MacDonald will be joined on the bill by fellow Scot KT Tunstall, and each will be performing in all four cities on the night.  An aircraft has been donated by prominent Glasgow-based businessman Andrew Devlin to provide the flight for the artists to use.  Comedian Fred MacAulay has been announced as the host for the Edinburgh event and acclaimed author Irvine Welsh will perform this year\u0026rsquos bedtime story.  The full lineup for each city including acts, special guests and hosts will be announced in the coming months.  Last year, Liam Gallagher, Deacon Blue and Frightened Rabbit entertained crowds.  Josh Littlejohn MBE, co-founder of Social Bite, described how the event last year raised \u0026ldquoan incredible \u0026pound4 million.  He said: \u0026ldquoEveryone who gave up their beds that night caused a sea change in Scotland\u0026rsquos fight against homelessness and have funded a raft of major projects, including a major \u0026lsquoHousing First\u0026rsquo initiative which is expected to take 800 rough sleepers off the streets by 2020.  \u0026ldquoFor Sleep in the Park 2018, we\u0026rsquore doing something that has never been done before: a simultaneous multi-city sleep out in Scotland\u0026rsquos four largest cities.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore asking for 12,000 people in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee to keep the momentum going and raise \u0026pound6 million.  \u0026ldquoBy organising these events locally, we will invest the funds so that homeless people in those cities are housed and given the support they need to get back on their feet.  \u0026ldquoThe money raised this year will be put towards rapidly rehousing rough sleepers and providing them with support.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll make sure the most vulnerable members of society - like people coming from the care system or prison - don\u0026rsquot end up homeless.  \u0026ldquoThe funds will also go towards a number of other programs that will be a catalyst for long-term structural change.  \u0026ldquoI fundamentally believe the statistics of homelessness in Scotland are not insurmountable.  \u0026ldquoBy collaborating, and treating homelessness as a political priority, Scotland can be a country where everyone has a place to call home.  Housing Minister, Kevin Stewart, added: \u0026ldquoHaving taken part in the event last year, it was amazing to see people come together to help the most vulnerable people in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoPublic support for events like the Sleep Out demonstrates the appetite for change, and the Scottish Government absolutely shares this commitment to ending homelessness.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see the events being expanded throughout Scotland and I\u0026rsquod encourage everyone to get involved.  Alongside Sleep in the Park, Social Bite is preparing to welcome its first residents to the Social Bite Village in the coming weeks.  Located in Granton, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, the Social Bite Village consists of 11 purpose-built two bedroom homes and a community hub, and will provide a stable and supported communal way of living for 20 people at a time for around 12 to 18 months.  Members of the public can join Sleep in the Park by committing to raise \u0026pound100.  Businesses can sponsor the event by signing up a team of five with a minimum fundraising commitment for \u0026pound3,000.

The ancient mythical story of Deirdrie and Naoise is also one of the first documenting the shared destiny of the people of Scotland and Ireland.  Now a romantic landmark has been unveiled on the west coast of Scotland in honour of the legend, close to a spot where the couple were said to have found some tranquillity together.  The \u0026ldquoSheiling for Deirdre and Naoise was officially unveiled at a ceremony on Saturday, attended by Michael Russell MSP and Mark Hanniffy, the Consul General of Ireland to Scotland, along with more than 100 guests and local dignitaries.  The sheiling itself \u0026ndash a Gaelic word for a hut, or collection of huts, once common in wild and lonely places in the hills and mountains \u0026ndash is on the slopes of Beinn Ghlas, near Taynuilt, overlooking Loch Etive, Argyll.  It marks a personal love story as well as it was commissioned by Sam Macdonald, whose wife, Evelyn Day, died of cancer last year, six weeks after being diagnosed. Mr MacDonald, 76, said that when his 83-year-old Irish wife of 50 years was told she did not have long to live, she asked him to build a memorial to mark her favourite story, so famed in Irish mythology.  Mr Macdonald said: \u0026ldquoWe decided on the garden when we knew that time was running out. We came out of the consultants, and after we gathered ourselves together, we started working on some lasting memory.  The tale itself, which links Ireland with Scotland, was first featured in the Glenmasan Manuscript, which is held in the National Library in Edinburgh and has just celebrated its 780th anniversary.  Known as \u0026ldquoDeirdre of the Sorrows, legend has it that before she was born, the most famous woman in Irish mythology was prophesied to become so beautiful, kings and lords would wage war over her. Urged to kill her at birth, King Conchobar of Ulster decided to put her into seclusion until she was old enough for him to take as a wife.  But fate intervened and Deirdre met Naoise, a handsome warrior in the King\u0026rsquos court and the pair fell instantly in love, fleeing to Scotland where they lived a happy life alongside his brothers for a number of years, until word reached them that the King would allow them to return to Ulster. However, upon so doing, Naoise was killed and the distraught Deirdre went on to take her own life.  The President of Ireland, Michael Higgins, was unable to attend the ceremony at the weekend, but sent a message of support, which read: \u0026ldquoThe tragic tale of the two doomed lovers is one of the great tales of an Ruraiocht, the Ulster Cycle, a mythic arc that is the shared inheritance of the peoples of Scotland and Ireland.  \u0026ldquoThere is perhaps no place on our islands more representative of that shared inheritance than Argyll, once the home of the ancient Gaelic Kingdom of Dal Riada. It was there that Cu Chulainn, the warrior-hero of the Ulaid, was said to have learned the arts of war, and it was there that Deirdrie sought sanctuary with Naoise and his brothers Arden and Ainle.  \u0026ldquoI am so pleased that a magnificent memorial will now rest forever on Beinn Ghlas, not far from Gleann \u0026Egraveite, the place Deirdre and Naoise were said to have found a moment of peace. May it stand as a monument, not only to the common past of the peoples of Scotland and Ireland, but to the shared destiny of our two ancient countries.  The sheiling is on land once owned by Mr Macdonald, now taken over by onshore wind generation firm Ventient Energy. It features within it the statue of Deirdre and Naoise that was originally created by Glasgow School of Art graduate, Fiona McLeod, for Scotland\u0026rsquos National Gardening Show, held in Strathclyde Park in 1997. The golden statue had been in Mr Macdonald\u0026rsquos garden since the show closed.  Visually, the sheiling, situated near one of the turbines on the Ventient Energy wind farm, looks like it has been on the site for 1,000 years due to its historic features, looking across the stunning Scottish landscape to where Deirdre and Naoise were said to live in the 7th Century AD.  Scott Mackenzie, CEO of Ventient Energy, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted to support Sam Macdonald in creating the stunning \u0026lsquoSheiling for Deirdre and Naoise\u0026rsquo. Its creation is being celebrated by the entire community and is something that can be visited and enjoyed by locals and visitors from further afield, including Ireland.  Mr Macdonald said the stories preserved largely through oral tradition are from a time when \u0026ldquoan aristocratic warrior class dominated, \u0026ldquo characterised by dramatic stories of fighting and adventure on the part of the chiefs.  He said Deirdre\u0026rsquos powerful tale, with its \u0026ldquoelements of lust, treachery and ultimate death, is vividly told and that while one may question whether the characters in the story ever existed, recent research into place names in the North Lorn area of Argyll suggests they may well have done. The findings raised the idea that perhaps Deirdre, Naoise and his brothers Arden and Ainle were real and did indeed reside in Glen Etive, given the number of place names that memorialise them in the landscape.  In raising the Sheiling for Deirdre and her lover, Mr Macdonald said he hopes to revitalise the ancient myths and reinforce the strong social and cultural ties that link the people of the west Highlands with their Irish neighbours across the water.  He is hopeful it will draw visitors from around the world as well.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos going to be a very romantic spot, he said. \u0026ldquoIt will be lovely if someone proposes there \u0026ndash and there\u0026rsquos the possibility of weddings, as outdoor weddings are very much in vogue now."},{"url":null,"title":"orwell-would-have-loved-this-book-loki-wins-prestigious-literary-prize","story":"              IT has been described as a \"savage, wise and witty tour-de-force\" by JK Rowling, and has been one of the most talked-about books published in Scotland in recent times.

The win is also a coup for Luath, a small press based in the Scottish capital.  Andrew Adonis, the chair of the judges, said: \"George Orwell would have loved this book.  \"It echoes Down and Out in Paris and London and The Road to Wigan Pier.  \"It is heart-rending in its life story and its account of family breakdown and poverty.  \"But by the end there is not a scintilla of self-pity and a huge amount of optimism.

He was part of the Poverty Truth Commission that was hosted in Glasgow in 2009 and has presented eight programmes for BBC Scotland exploring the root causes of anti-social behaviour and social deprivation.

Excavations at the Udal on the Outer Hebridean island have uncovered some of the hardships islanders faced during Neolithic and early Bronze Age Scotland.  Analysis of two skeletons discovered at the site indicates they suffered a lack of food as children, including periods of starvation.

The research, published in a new book, reveals that islanders were then hit by further storms, with one bringing a flood so severe that it destroyed their new fields and spread a thick stone and shingle beach across them.  The devastating weather damaged crops and killed animals, impacting on the health of residents, as shown in the two skeletons which were discovered in a burial cairn.  Ms Ballin Smith added: \u0026ldquoOur Neolithic and Bronze Age ancestors lived through climate change events such as dramatic sea-level rise and increased storminess, and trauma such as loss of fields, crops and animals.  \u0026ldquoThey had to relocate their settlement and houses to safer areas.

The new book is edited by Ms Ballin Smith who has spent years analysing his excavations.

Keryn Laver, of Oakley, near Dunfermline, needed urgent help to deliver the baby after her waters broke while her husband Jules was rushing her to the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy.  Now she has been reunited with the Scottish Ambulance Service paramedics who helped bring little Keldan into the world and said: It was a very, very memorable birth and I am absolutely pleased it turned out the way it did. We are lucky it was very straight forward.  The day of Keldan\u0026rsquos birth had an extra special significance for Keryn it was the day her brother, Cedric, passed away in 2009 after a sailing accident.  While the birth of her first child Torin three years ago took\u0026nbsp27 hours, baby number two due on March 11 was a very different story.    At around 8pm, four days before the baby was due, the 39-year-old phoned Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy to say that contractions had started and were happening around every two minutes.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe hospital told me to get in fast. The contractions got closer together and I phoned a babysitter.  \u0026ldquoI told them \u0026lsquoyou will have to come here very quickly \u0026ndash the baby is coming. I was sitting on the couch at home, and my husband Jules was with me.  \u0026ldquoThe babysitter took about 20 minutes to arrive \u0026ndash the contractions were coming so fast and then my water broke as I was getting into the car. We were in the car and I was screaming. My husband started driving me to hospital.  \u0026ldquoAround 0.8 miles down the road, there was a little layby near the Carnock Inn. It was a little layby, but it still big enough to get two cars in.  \u0026ldquoJules called 999 at around 8.45pm \u0026ndash they could hear me in the background. I was in the front seat and I still had my jeans on. The call taker asked Jules if he could see anything, whether I was dilated or if he could see the baby\u0026rsquos head.  \u0026ldquoThey said they would send an ambulance as quickly as they could. The ambulance came around the corner and must have heard me from the car.  As she was put on to the stretcher by paramedics Andrew Paterson and Richard Garside, based at Dunfermline, the baby\u0026rsquos head was out.  But the paramedic crew, on their first job for the night, helped deliver the baby at 9.03pm, perfectly healthy, at 8lb 6oz.    Mrs Laver added: \u0026ldquoHolding this little baby, I was full of joy. I think for my husband it was a huge relief that he did not have to deliver it. He had to drive himself to the hospital, but he saw the baby being born.  \u0026ldquoJules took some time to compose himself, he was keeping it together, but it was so close to him having to deliver the baby in the car. He had to keep calm, but once the crew arrived, he could enjoy the birth and then all the emotions hit.  Keryn said it was a \u0026ldquototally different experience to the birth of her first child.  She explained: \u0026ldquoWith my first baby, I didn\u0026rsquot know what to expect, and it was a really long labour. I prefer a quick birth.  After her second birth, she said she could have been home that night but she was kept in Victoria overnight, arriving home the next morning.  Keryn continued: \u0026ldquoThe crew was really surprised, and they were very good with both of us they were joking with me, and supportive of Jules. They gave me whatever I needed.  Mr Paterson also gave Keldan a knitted beanie, made by the paramedic\u0026rsquos grandmother, and kept in the back of the ambulance for such occasions.  Now, the Oakley mum said March 7 has a different meaning these days, adding: \u0026ldquoIt changes a bitter day and turns it into a happy day.  \u0026ldquoEvery time his birthday comes around, we will tell the story \u0026ndash it will be told at his 21st birthday.  \u0026ldquoTorin was quite pleased to meet his baby brother. It took a while to realise it happened so quickly.  In memory of her brother, Keryn named her second child Keldan Cedric Laver.  She said her friends, once hearing of the birth, were shocked and couldn\u0026rsquot believe the location of the birth.

The Nuclear Education Trust, a think-tank and charity, says their conclusion is drawn from evidence from defence diversification projects around the world.  The report recommends that workers and communities must take the lead in making decisions for moving away from Trident \"but a broad partnership involving all stakeholders is necessary for success\".    Funding must be available not just for putting a plan into action but for organising, analysis of the situation, planning and then implementation, the charity said.  Peter Burt, Nuclear Education Trust Board trustee said: \u0026ldquoOur independent analysis of international experience of defence diversification tells us that a government needs to be proactive in getting the conditions right for a successful transition from skilled defence jobs to those in the equally skilled, civil sector. Those conditions include complete stakeholder participation including workers and communities, and national, regional and local political support. Proactive planning and comprehensive funding, with continued learning for effective implementation are essential for success.  \"Many defence industry jobs are at risk from automation, global supply chains, changes in strategic thinking as well as the sheer cost of the work in today\u0027s austere financial climate. The Nuclear Education Trust calls on the current and future governments to make use of the findings of this research and integrate them into an effective defence diversification policy, part of a comprehensive industrial strategy.\"  Fabian Hamilton, MP, shadow minister for peace and disarmament said: \"While it is not yet Labour Party policy to scrap Trident, I am committed, not only to transitioning away from nuclear weapons, but to protecting jobs at the same time.  \"High-skilled jobs are good for our economy and, if we decide to transition away from Trident, defence diversification is the only way to ensure that the vital skills used in the development of Britain\u0027s nuclear weapons are not lost.  TUC deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said: \"The UK\u0027s defence capability will always need to change over time to safeguard against new threats in a changing world. When decisions are made, it\u0027s important to protect and prioritise good quality UK jobs and the communities linked to the defence industry. Unions and the workforce should have a say in creating new opportunities for highly skilled workers in defence and other advanced manufacturing and engineering industries.\"  The report is launched in Parliament at 4pm on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-yes-immigration-is-a-good-thing","story":"              I SOMETIMES wonder why we call them \u0026ldquoleaders, when the evidence suggests that most politicians are remarkably slow to catch up with popular opinion. Take, for example, the EU\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoemergency summit on migration, which has been convened just as immigration from illegal crossings of the Mediterranean and asylum claims have reached their lowest level for years.  The impetus for these talks is not the genuine refugee crisis that faced European countries several years ago, when Angela Merkel blithely introduced an open-door policy that has seen about 1.4 million migrants arrive in Germany since 2015. That, incidentally, created a huge upsurge in human trafficking, deaths at sea and an enormous headache for the southern European countries, especially Italy, to which many migrants headed. While that was at its peak, Mrs Merkel carried on as if there were no problem.  Now that she is dependent on her coalition partners, the anti-immigration Christian Social Union, it\u0026rsquos her political prospects that are in danger rather than piffling matters such as the lives of refugees or the cultural stability of Europe. The issue has naturally become much more pressing. It\u0026rsquos par for the course, I suppose, that the political priorities of the leader of a comfortable Western country should trump (I use the word advisedly) the desperation of those who come from places torn apart by war, governed by oppressive regimes, or devoid of opportunities to make a decent living. Yet migration has become a uniquely divisive issue, for reasons which often seem thoroughly irrational.  The EU summit has already been boycotted by four EU countries \u0026ndash the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia \u0026ndash where immigration is a significant populist issue, while Italy has produced proposals which aim to end the link between a migrant\u0026rsquos point of arrival and the responsibility for dealing with his or her asylum claim.  Given that Italy has had to deal with the results of Mrs Merkel\u0026rsquos implied \u0026ldquocome one, come all rhetoric, that\u0026rsquos understandable but it will horrify other EU leaders, many of whom face growing electoral discontent over immigration. It could also create further problems for freedom of movement within the EU \u0026ndash one of the \u0026ldquofour fundamental freedoms.  In fact, despite Schengen\u0026rsquos supposed guarantee of free movement, the migrant crisis has already led to internal restrictions despite the EU\u0026rsquos objections border controls were instituted between Denmark and Sweden for several years.  Yet the EU\u0026rsquos talk of freedom of movement, rather like its talk of its single market, disguises the underlying problem, which is that neither its movements nor its markets are in any sense genuinely free. On the contrary they are protectionist measures which create barriers to those outside (which means, of course, most of the rest of the world, and the developing world in particular).  Before the First World War, in a world of many more borders and nation states, there were few obstacles to travel and resettlement, passports and border controls were a rarity and naturalisation for longstanding residents was a mere formality. The United States, where Donald Trump is disgustingly and dishonestly weaponising debate on the subject, owes its existence and success entirely to immigration.  Part of the reason this approach is working with so many Trump voters, and is also gaining support for similarly unsavoury populists such as Marine Le Pen in France and Viktor Orban in Hungary, is, it must be said, the reluctance of Western political elites to countenance discussion of the issue, and their implication that anyone who raises concerns about immigration is a racist. It\u0026rsquos only eight years, remember, since Gordon Brown airily dismissed Gillian Brown, one of his own supporters, as a \u0026ldquobigoted woman for raising the matter.  The reason this attitude was so dangerous was that it concealed the facts about immigration and conflated the issue with a quite separate one, which is to do with multi-culturalism and globalisation. Racism in Britain, though it certainly exists, is fortunately confined to a (dwindling) minority.  Immigration, despite the noise about it, is also a minority concern, even among Leave voters not a single poll found it cited as the major factor in the Brexit referendum.  But it is a very bad thing that it has not been properly discussed, because the evidence in favour of immigration is overwhelmingly positive, while the objections to it are largely about issues such as integration, welfare, schools and the provision of social housing.  Immigrants contribute considerably more to the economy than they cost (one report found European Economic Area migrants put in 34 per cent more in tax than they claimed in welfare payments). One obvious example of their contribution is the NHS, where more than one quarter of the doctors employed are from overseas. One consequence of Theresa May\u0026rsquos misinterpretation of Brexit (which she opposed) as being primarily about immigration (which most Leave voters did not list as a priority) is to endanger not only healthcare but also all manner of other areas of our economy.  Agriculture, education, and the technology sector, for example, are all highly dependent on migrant workers or overseas students. And the decline in the birthrate in Western countries, and their ageing populations, ought to make importing people to contribute to pensions a priority.  What\u0026rsquos more, a welcoming approach towards immigration ought to be the natural position for a party which claims to support economic growth, a free society and open markets. From a truly liberal perspective, immigration policy shouldn\u0026rsquot even be a matter for the Government but for the market. After all, if people choose to come to the UK, it is because they see it as an opportunity for themselves and their families and, if they choose to stay, they become British anyway.  Businesses and immigrants themselves are best placed to determine whether migration is in their mutual interest, which is why the idea of having some number plucked from the air, with no reference to need or desirability, fixed as a cap is absurd. The Home Secretary\u0026rsquos announcement that the default position of the UK would be to grant settled status to EU nationals living here was welcome, if belated, but did not go far enough.  Politicians should be making the case that immigration is not a problem but a boon, while populist rhetoric about crime or welfare should be rebutted vigorously. If the EU leaders have not wanted to discuss the issue until now, the least they can do is point out that the facts disprove the claims of those opposed to immigration."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-steps-up-call-for-sewel-convention-to-become-law","story":"              THE SNP Government will today ramp up its demand to have the Sewel convention made legally binding, as it appeals to other parties to defend the devolution settlement.  The 20-year-old Sewel Convention says Westminster will \u0026ldquonot normally legislate in devolved areas without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.  The UK Government breached it for the first time last week, pressing ahead with the EU Withdrawal Bill at Westminster in spite of Holyrood withholding its consent by 90 votes to 30.  The convention is not a law, merely a political agreement, and cannot be enforced in court.  However SNP ministers are now demanding that it be converted into law, something which would effectively give Holyrood a veto over a number of Westminster Bills.  Although this is likely to prove politically and constitutionally impossible, the SNP has threatened to withhold consent from other Brexit-related Bills unless the demand is met, setting the scene for a series of confrontations with London in the autumn.  Brexit minister Michael Russell said: \u0026ldquoThe UK Government\u0026rsquos position of ignoring or over-riding the views of the Scottish Parliament has been a consistent pattern since the EU referendum two years ago. This can\u0026rsquot go on.  \u0026ldquoThey have ignored votes on protecting Scotland\u0026rsquos relationship with the EU triggering Article 50, retaining our place in the Single Market and Customs Union and have now passed legislation on devolved matters for the first time without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.  \u0026ldquoI believe we need to revisit the issue of a proper statutory footing for the Sewel Convention, as recommended by the cross-party Smith Commission after the independence referendum.  \u0026ldquoToday we are holding a debate without a motion and vote because, in stark contrast to Westminster, I want to hear from all parties on how we can protect the Scottish Parliament and ensure the views of the people of Scotland are respected, and not ignored in the Brexit process as they have been up until now."},{"url":null,"title":"economy-secretary-out-in-sturgeon-reshuffle","story":"              NICOLA Sturgeon has\u0026nbspstarted reshuffling\u0026nbspher cabinet, with Economy Secretary Keith Brown leaving to focus on campaigning for independence.

Quality Pork Limited in Brechin, Angus, will carry out its last slaughter at 4pm due to a lack of the gas used to stun animals before they are killed.  There are plans to send around 1,000 pigs to another plant near Manchester this week, but operators say the CO2 shortage could have serious implications if the shortage continues.  Beer, fizzy drinks and meat producers have all warned of possible shortages caused by a lack of the gas as the UK enters peak consumption amid World Cup festivities and high summer temperatures.  In a statement, the soft drinks giant said: \"We are currently responding to an industry-wide issue that is impacting the supply of C02 in the UK. Our focus is on limiting the effect this may have on the availability of our products.  \"We are working closely with our suppliers, partners and customers on a number of solutions as the situation develops.\"  Supermarket Morrisons said some frozen products had been affected by the shortage, and it aimed to resume selling its full online range \"as soon as possible\".  Quality Pork Limited operates in collaboration with UK-wide meat processor Tulip and the Scottish Pig Producers (SPP) co-operative, whose chief executive, Andy McGowan, said the industry was facing an unprecedented situation.  Mr McGowan said he did not know when to expect the next CO2 delivery from supplier BOC.  He said: \"That\u0027s the frustrating thing - they\u0027re not telling us anything. We\u0027re pretty dismayed.  \"The top priority is animal welfare - we will not have ourselves in a situation where the welfare is suffering.\"  British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) chief executive Nick Allen said the situation was getting \"pretty tight\", exacerbated by the hot temperatures.  Mr Allen said: \"The frustration is the lack of information. We understand that several (CO2) producers are reopening plants and restarting production, but getting information is very difficult, which makes it very difficult to plan.  \"Things are getting pretty tight and this hot weather won\u0027t be helping. If things don\u0027t alter this week, we\u0027re going to see people having to make some serious decisions, mainly in the pig production area.\"  Poultry slaughterhouses have already called for priority supplies of dwindling CO2 stocks, saying the current shortage could have a \"potentially huge effect\" on British food production.  The shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe - which is used to carbonate drinks and preserve some packed fresh foods.  Trade journal Gas World said the shortage had been described as the \"worst supply situation to hit the European carbon dioxide (CO2) business in decades\".  The UK has been hit particularly hard as only one major CO2 plant was operating earlier this week and imports from the continent have been affected by shut-downs in Benelux and France.  The British Soft Drinks Association said the shortage was continuing to affect a wide range of businesses across the food and drink sector."},{"url":null,"title":"ofcom-give-green-light-to-new-bbc-scotland-channel","story":"              THE new BBC digital channel for Scotland has been given the final green light by broadcasting watchdog Ofcom.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events. We all share the same vision in terms of upholding Orkney’s reputation as a quality food and drink location and we’re all very proud to be representing the islands on the national stage.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I came here in 2016 and part of what drew me was the juxtaposition of a cultural and natural heritage site.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions. Chairman Ian Blake of Aultgrishan said it was an exciting setting for competitors and \"will provide visitors to the gardens with a unique opportunity to hear some of the most gifted young inheritors of our much cherished Highland heritage\". Entries are now open in a variety of classes. He can be contacted at emailing mackenzie@iambik.orgMeanwhile Inverewe is anticipating the bursting into colour of a Puya alpestris, which resembles a giant asparagus, for the first time in seven years.Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Dingwall were named runners-up with Alness third and Invergordon fifth. The challenge, which is contested by schools around the world, aims to provide a natural high for participants by providing a positive focus to produce a dramatic eight-minute performance with a message.Ross-based Highland MSP Maree Todd, who is the Scottish Government minister for childcare and early years, was in attendance to present the second place prize.She said: \"These were really inspiring, very high quality performances.\"This is the first time I\u0026rsquove been to a Scottish Final and I\u0026rsquom absolutely blown away by the quality of the dancing, incredible costumes and sets.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 3:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We used a horse here because of the minimal environmental impact it would have and, to be honest, you\u0026rsquod hardly know they\u0026rsquod been here.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race. I felt good going into it and was able to counter any attacks and came down to a sprint where I was able to take the win.\"The news got better when British Cycling announced the world championship squad for this year with my name on it. I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to pulling on the GB kit for the first time.\"The hard work is paying off and I am hoping this is a stepping stone towards becoming a full-time GB rider. I\u0026rsquom really happy at being given this opportunity, being only 18 years old.\"He said the last eight months had only been possible thanks to the generosity of Moray Estates in paying for all his training and racing travel costs.He also thanked Tesco Dingwall which had been flexible with his shifts, allowing him to travel to races.Last year\u0026rsquos Strathpuffer 24-hour endurance event raised \u0026pound1000 to be divided between Fin and the charity Lupus UK.Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 3:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The project also details Avoch\u0026rsquos fishing heritage, and more information on this can be found on panels at the harbour and among the \"streeties\" \u0026ndash the rows of old fishermen\u0026rsquos cottages.Funding for the new project was provided by Avoch Heritage Association in recognition of the work AKCC is doing to promote the village and its historical significance.The community council\u0026rsquos chairwoman Sarah Dunton said: \"Volunteers from AKCC carried out the restoration work on the wooden frame and also created the updated information panel.\u0026nbsp\"It is a testament to the great team spirit existing within AKCC.\u0026nbsp\"We are very grateful to Avoch Heritage Association for generously funding this project.\u0026nbsp\"It will encourage not just residents of Avoch and Killen but also visitors to the Black Isle to enjoy the beautiful scenery and wildlife surrounding us.\"Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 3:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.
