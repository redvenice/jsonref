Nigel is just like that.He can also very quickly learn simple things like when to come, where to walk and when to quietly lie down.Nothing that a million other dogs couldn’t do just as well, but very few would do them so reliably, time after time, among the slightly chaotic, crowded circumstances of a TV shoot.Although Gardeners’ World is carefully edited to appear as an easy, natural flow of action, the reality of filming is anything but that. Every action and every word will have to be repeated at least two or three times, and often as many as seven or eight.This means Nigel also has to repeat every action half a dozen times at exactly the right moment — often with mind-numbingly slow minutes between takes. And he does this with astonishing compliance.I do have a potent incentive: a small yellow tennis ball in my pocket that, critically, has a squeak. So when asked if he can look in my direction while I’m speaking rather than making eyes at the crew — Nigel is a terrible flirt — I’ll give the ball a quick squeak just as the director says: ‘Action!’Nigel, terribly excited by this, then spends the rest of the take looking across to see where the noise and glorious hint of tennis ball aroma is coming from.He has remained an unusually talkative dog, with noises that are friendly, varied and very, very frequent.One of his specialities is a long sobbing welcome. The more surprised he is to see you, the more vocal he becomes, with a welcoming bark in these situations that amounts to a shout. Sometimes, he goes off to spend the day farming with my son. And if I then go over myself and he discovers me in the farmyard, Nigel greets me as though I’ve returned from walking across the Arctic.What? You! Here? Why, hello! What an unbelievable coincidence! To stumble across each other in this place, on this day, at this time. Amazing!Another thing about Nigel is that he smiles a lot. Not the crinkly, toothy, squinty-eyed grin that some dogs produce when they see you — which is not really a smile at all, but a submissive gesture — but the relaxed, slack-mouthed beam of someone pleased with their lot.This has nothing to do with other dogs or people, but often has a lot to do with a stick or ball that is now between his front paws, ready for the next match of fun. Life at that point is very, very good.So Nigel beams, the corners of his mouth high, his tongue out, his eyes soft and shining and his tail wagging. At times like this, he radiates goodwill and simple pleasure, which has the desired effect of provoking greater happiness in me by playing with him.I feel happier seeing him he feels tremendously happy — we’re all thoroughly cheered up.I think that this is an important reason why we love our dogs. We get visible and straightforward feedback from them when we do something to please them.There are no strings attached, no complications or trade-offs, no debts accruing or owing, no judgment of any kind made.You throw a ball or scratch an ear and the dog likes it and lets you know. That’s it.Nigel also likes to sit on my lap when I’m in an armchair by the fire, and will climb up in a manner that I suspect he regards as stealthy but is, in fact, just insistent.Once balanced on my knees, he sinks into a deep and heavy-limbed sleep that leaves me quite unable to read my book, let alone reach for the glass that is tantalisingly close to hand, were it not for 70lb of Nigel pinning me to the chair.I do believe that dogs can truly love their owners.But I always feel deeply uncomfortable when owners talk about their pets as though they were human, because this seems to diminish the relationship, rather than enhance it. I often look at Nigel, and think what an extraordinary thing it is to have this large animal sharing the house with us, and how dependent that relationship is upon him choosing to go along with it rather than me enforcing it.This seems to me much more mysterious and wonderful than acting as though he’s simply a four-footed human."},{"url":null,"title":"Dutch government advises singletons looking intimacy come agreement regular partner","story":"Share this articleCoronavirus: Dutch singletons advised to seek ‘sex buddy’ - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Wall wall sales rest year shops gear reopen stock grabs","story":"Share this article\u0027Rainbow sale\u0027: high street gears up for massive post-lockdown discounts | Business | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Family took UKs coronavirus vaccine trials say duty part","story":"Coronavirus vaccine hope as family step forward for trial | UK | News | Express.co.uk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee8cf0a0ee50d839de5501a8946e702da9a75851/3_222_3653_2192/master/3653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7091558deef17308b620868003fe98ef","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Physical distancing, lockdown and protests about the death of Ahmaud Arbery – the most striking photographs from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1befca8f40f7f6b3ed3fa1eaf1d7e41f7a50a4b/0_320_7195_4315/master/7195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2428085e7ed3498209b673f2085ef33","title":"park and recreation in pictures","story":"Photographer Suki Dhanda captures the early morning beauty of London’s Hackney Marshes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc71ea419f28911c3e7b8328b29c4a7dd4b9a50a/113_1080_3844_2307/master/3844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f78fab44c0b5fec7d3fe05768f325c63","title":"dara mcanulty nature writing diary of a young naturalist","story":"Dara McAnulty is being hailed by the likes of Robert Macfarlane and Chris Packham as a bright new voice. He talks about life with autism and finding peace in the wilds of Northern IrelandIt is a challenging time to be 16 and, like his peers, Dara McAnulty must currently endure a form of house arrest that means no seeing friends, no GCSEs. Unlike other locked-down teens, McAnulty is also dealing with the harsh mischance of having his first book, Diary of a Young Naturalist, published during the coronavirus crisis. He was supposed to be touring festivals but every date is cancelled. “I feel like my being is suffering from a slow puncture,” McAnulty tweeted in March. “I honestly feel like my world is falling apart right now.”When we meet via a video call a month later, his mood has lifted. Lockdown is tough. His mum, Róisín – who McAnulty likes to have by his side, discreetly, during interviews – contracted coronavirus quite severely meanwhile, he feels “trapped” and is “bouncing around the house like a ping pong ball”. Mercifully, over the road from their modern housing estate is a wood where he takes his daily exercise. “If I didn’t have it, I would be utterly insane,” he says. “The ground there is alive with peacock butterflies”, and that morning, he saw a red squirrel “so that makes the day”, he grins.There is a genuine buzz around his debut, a combination of nature book and memoir, a warm portrait of a close-knit family and a coming-of-age story. Robert Macfarlane has hailed his “extraordinary voice and vision” Chris Packham has become a friend Steve Silberman, author of NeuroTribes, called him “inspiring”. The teenager’s environmental activism has led to comparisons with Greta Thunberg.McAnulty is autistic, and it would be easy to file his book alongside Packham’s Fingers in the Sparkle Jar which gave a vivid insight into the naturalist’s Asperger’s but Dara has his own style. Simple, gorgeous sentences unfurl, one after another. Of a hot summer’s day, he writes: “Dragonflies are whizzing, grasshoppers are trembling in the grass, and swallows are everywhere.” Or: “The valley sings, heaves and rests.” There are original, imaginative descriptions too – caterpillars move “like slow-motion accordions” and a goshawk chick looks “like an autumn forest rolled in the first snows of winter”.He lives with his dad, Paul, mum and younger siblings, Lorcan and Bláthnaid, in a small rented three-bedroom house in Castlewellan, Northern Ireland. As a young child, Dara loved to bang on about black holes to anyone who would listen, and was diagnosed as autistic when he was five. In fact, Róisín, Lorcan and Bláthnaid are also autistic only Paul, a conservation scientist, is not. The teenager describes his family as “as close as otters”. They are also punk lovers, chaotic and “pretty formidable, apparently”.McAnulty exudes energy and laughs a lot. His voice, however, belongs to an older man, and his writing is often unexpectedly wise too. When I ask about literary inspiration, he answers immediately: Seamus Heaney. “You can reread his poems again and again” there are “all these different compartments like bubbles. You pop them one at a time and there’s no centre to it. There’s this saying about a brain: if a brain was simple enough to understand, we’d be too stupid to understand that brain. That’s almost the same as Seamus Heaney’s poems because they have such complex connections.”He also enjoys reading Ursula K Le Guin, is currently “neck-deep” in his umpteenth rereading of The Lord of the Rings, and is fond of Agatha Christie for her focus on people’s hidden motives. “That’s been quite important to me because I try my best to learn about humans so I can make acceptable social interactions.”A teacher once told McAnulty he would never be able to string a paragraph together. He was miserable – “and miserable is an understatement” – at a succession of schools, including Oscar Wilde’s alma mater, Portora. The bullying (he didn’t know how to make small talk about Minecraft) intensified as he became a teenager. The noise and clutter of classrooms made them the worst environment for him.McAnulty learned that being in nature helped. “I can’t speak for all autistic people, but I feel things more intensely. In a shopping centre there’s all of those different noises coming from different angles – my brain can’t process them quickly enough, and everything goes completely crazy. Being out in nature, the sounds are quite level and I find it easier with muted colours. Everything just works. It’s not oppressive.”He wrote from a young age, on scraps of paper. “One of my ways of processing the world is writing things down,” he says. Then social media helped him find a path. Aged 12, he began a blog about nature and joined Twitter. “Four years ago I wouldn’t have been able to talk to you right now,” he says. “Twitter opened my world to like-minded people. You’ll always find someone who is willing to talk to you about mycelial networks. It’s given me so many opportunities to connect with people and not feel so isolated.”As McAnulty wrote, and also took his first steps in environmental activism – campaigning to end the persecution of birds of prey – his blog gained readers and admirers. Three years ago, he appeared on Springwatch and was befriended by Packham. Adrian Cooper and Gracie Burnett, the husband-and-wife team behind tiny independent publisher Little Toller spotted his writing and began talking to his family about a book.Diary of a Young Naturalist tells the story of McAnulty’s year from spring equinox to spring equinox, from his 14th to 15th birthday. It was a difficult time. His family moved from one side of Northern Ireland to the other and he had to cope with changing schools and losing his cherished wild heartlands, a forest called Big Dog. “When I was younger, I remember moving from a school I absolutely hated. Even though I wanted to get out of that place with every single fibre of my body, still, in the back of my mind, I was going: ‘I don’t want change.’”The move from Big Dog precipitated a breakdown, where McAnulty ended up screaming in panic in his garden. His struggles that summer were not helped by the rise of social media trolling (the downside of forging those positive connections). “Removing” himself from Big Dog “was devastating, as if it killed a part of me. Then I went up into the Mournes” – the mountain range close to his new home – “and everything became fine again.” Was his recovery as simple as that? “No, but it definitely helped discovering a new place and building up a new connection with the land. I slowly crawled my way back into some semblance of a calm state of mind. Exploring was a really big part of that, trying to find new places to root myself.”Writing was followed by a seven-month edit with Cooper and his parents. “All my family got together, trying to coax this book into something that was manageable,” says McAnulty. But Róisín says she wouldn’t want people to think his writing was overly shaped by others. “Although it has been edited sensitively and beautifully, the first draft was actually incredible.” Rewriting was a mixed blessing for McAnulty, forcing him to “re-experience” memories both traumatic and joyful. “I uncovered things about myself along the way. It’s like reading a book for the second time. I had to drag myself back through that thornbush. But I understood myself all the better because of it.”After his breakdown, he started at a new school. Despite huge anxiety, in the book he finds kindred souls and a nurturing environment. “It has been the best school I’ve had,” he says. He still has to flee lessons at times but “I have, dare I say it, friends now, for the first time ever. I’ve had the best luck in the world … I managed to land myself in a year group that was basically made up of nerds.”In the meantime, McAnulty keeps his family, and the simple glories of the natural world, close. His favourite time is dusk, when “the night sky seems to chase the sun out of the sky and you can’t really see the sun’s light but you know it’s just underneath the horizon,” he says. “At that time, the energy in the air is so charged. That’s when the bats begin to come out, and you feel such a rush.”• Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Toller (RRP £16). To order a copy go to bookshop.

Rosie is our constant companion on walks. We call her the “autistic dog” because she always wants to walk the same route. If we’re not all together, or if Mum isn’t with us, Rosie stops suddenly, digs her heels in. I remember once Dad phoning Mum pleading for help because Rosie wouldn’t budge. Mum had to go out and physically move her. Since then, it’s a standing joke that Mum is top dog. She-wolf.The walk is easy and I’m chatting with Mum because I’ve promised myself, and her, that I won’t hold things in to fester any more. First I tell her how much I’m missing our Fermanagh places, and that everything here is so strange and different. “It smells different,” I explain. “Not in a bad way, it just does. It sounds different, too, in a good way. There are definitely more birds here, more insects.”I then go on to tell her about Jude next door, my new friend. This makes her smile and the dimples in her cheeks become more pronounced – this happens when she’s tired. There are also shadows under her eyes, and seeing them I want to find the beauty in everything and promise not to let the bullies weigh me down. I have so much love around me. I want to do it for her. I want to do it for myself. It’s all around me, beauty, so why should it be hard?Darkness comes in quick and it’s time to head for home. Mum grabs my arm and we stop in the falling darkness to watch shadows fly from one side of the road to the other. Bats. Mum and I laugh, and the excitement bubbles up. We rush back to the house: I find the bat detector and pummel through the kitchen and out the back door. In the garden more shapes mobilise from the trees – the bat detector is forgotten as I watch this origami take flight, the bats’ nimble wings making strange angles as they take to the air to feed. I stay out when Mum heads back inside, watching the night sky. I notice a new feeling, a buzzing in the air, a pulsation that makes me look over to the buddleia growing in the garden. It’s whizzing with life and movement is palpitating in and around it. When the light goes on in the kitchen and I’m joined by everyone – Lorcan and Bláthnaid first, followed by Mum and Dad – I realise I must have shouted but don’t remember doing it.We watch in wonder as countless silver Y moths feast on the purple blooms. Some rest, drunk with nectar, before refilling, whirling and dancing in constant motion. The feather-like scales, brown flecked with silver, are shimmering with starry dust, protecting them from being eaten by our other nocturnal neighbours. I find it fascinating that silver Y fur can confuse the sonar readings of bats, and even when they are predated they can escape, leaving the bat with a mouthful of scales. And here we all are, the McAnultys congregated in worship of these tiny migrants. Soon they will make the journey to their birthplace, silver stars crossing land and sea to North Africa.The night crackles as the storm of flitting moves off. We jump up and down and hug each other, tension leaking out. We chat and look at the sky, sparkling with Orion, Seven Sisters and the Plough. This is us, standing here. All the best part of us, and another moment etched in our memories, to be invited back and relived in conversations for years to come. Remember that night, when fluttering stars calmed a storm in all of us.• Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Toller (RRP £16). To order a copy go to bookshop.

Now thousands of scholars are calling for a way out of the crisisWorking humans are so much more than “resources”. This is one of the central lessons of the current crisis. Caring for the sick delivering food, medication and other essentials clearing away our waste stocking the shelves and running the registers in our grocery stores – the people who have kept life going through the Covid-19 pandemic are living proof that work cannot be reduced to a mere commodity. Human health and the care of the most vulnerable cannot be governed by market forces alone. If we leave these things solely to the market, we run the risk of exacerbating inequalities to the point of forfeiting the very lives of the least advantaged.How to avoid this unacceptable situation? By involving employees in decisions relating to their lives and futures in the workplace – by democratising firms. By decommodifying work – by collectively guaranteeing useful employment to all. As we face the monstrous risk of pandemic and environmental collapse, making these strategic changes would allow us to ensure the dignity of all citizens while marshalling the collective strength and effort we need to preserve our life together on this planet.Every morning, men and women, especially members of racialised communities, migrants and informal economy workers, rise to serve those among us who are able to remain under quarantine. They keep watch through the night. The dignity of their jobs needs no other explanation than that eloquently simple term “essential worker”. That term also reveals a key fact that capitalism has always sought to render invisible with another term, “human resource”. Human beings are not one resource among many. Without labor investors, there would be no production, no services, no businesses at all.Every morning, quarantined men and women rise in their homes to fulfil from afar the missions of the organisations for which they work. They work into the night. To those who believe that employees cannot be trusted to do their jobs without supervision, that workers require surveillance and external discipline, these men and women are proving the contrary. They are demonstrating, day and night, that workers are not one type of stakeholder among many: they hold the keys to their employers’ success. They are the core constituency of the firm, but are, nonetheless, mostly excluded from participating in the government of their workplaces – a right monopolised by capital investors.To the question of how firms and how society as a whole might recognise the contributions of their employees in times of crisis, democracy is the answer. Certainly, we must close the yawning chasm of income inequality and raise the income floor – but that alone is not enough. After the two world wars, women’s undeniable contribution to society helped win them the right to vote. By the same token, it is time to enfranchise workers.Representation of labour investors in the workplace has existed in Europe since the close of the second world war, through institutions known as works councils. Yet these representative bodies have a weak voice at best in the government of firms, and are subordinate to the choices of the executive management teams appointed by shareholders. They have been unable to stop or even slow the relentless momentum of self-serving capital accumulation, ever more powerful in its destruction of our environment. These bodies should now be granted similar rights to those exercised by boards. To do so, firm governments (that is, top management) could be required to obtain double majority approval, from chambers representing workers as well as shareholders. In Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, different forms of codetermination (Mitbestimmung) put in place progressively after the second world war were a crucial step toward giving a voice to workers – but they are still insufficient to create actual citizenship in firms. Even in the United States, where worker organising and union rights have been considerably suppressed, there is now a growing call to give labour investors the right to elect representatives with a supermajority within boards. Issues such as the choice of a CEO, setting major strategies and profit distribution are too important to be left to shareholders alone. A personal investment of labour that is, of one’s mind and body, one’s health – one’s very life – ought to come with the collective right to validate or veto these decisions.This crisis also shows that work must not be treated as a commodity, that market mechanisms alone cannot be left in charge of the choices that affect our communities most deeply. For years now, jobs and supplies in the health sector have been subject to the guiding principle of profitability today, the pandemic is revealing the extent to which this principle has led us astray. Certain strategic and collective needs must simply be made immune to such considerations. The rising body count across the globe is a terrible reminder that some things must never be treated as commodities. Those who continue arguing to the contrary are imperilling us with their dangerous ideology. Profitability is an intolerable yardstick when it comes to our health and our life on this planet.Decommodifying work means preserving certain sectors from the laws of the so-called free market it also means ensuring that all people have access to work and the dignity it brings. One way to do this is with the creation of a job guarantee. Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reminds us that everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. A job guarantee would not only offer each person access to work that allows them to live with dignity, it would also provide a crucial boost to our collective capability to meet the many pressing social and environmental challenges we currently face. Guaranteed employment would allow governments, working through local communities, to provide dignified work while contributing to the immense effort of fighting environmental collapse. Across the globe, as unemployment skyrockets, job guarantee programs can play a crucial role in assuring the social, economic, and environmental stability of our democratic societies. The European Union must include such a project in its green deal. A review of the mission of the European Central Bank so that it could finance this program, which is necessary to our survival, would give it a legitimate place in the life of each and every citizen of the EU. A countercyclical solution to the explosive unemployment on the way, this program will prove a key contribution to the EU’s prosperity. We should not react now with the same innocence as in 2008, when we responded to the economic crisis with an unconditional bailout that swelled public debt while demanding nothing in return. If our governments step in to save businesses in the current crisis, then businesses must step in as well, and meet the general basic conditions of democracy. In the name of the democratic societies they serve, and which constitute them, in the name of their responsibility to ensure our survival on this planet, our governments must make their aid to firms conditional on certain changes to their behaviours. In addition to hewing to strict environmental standards, firms must be required to fulfil certain conditions of democratic internal government. A successful transition from environmental destruction to environmental recovery and regeneration will be best led by democratically governed firms, in which the voices of those who invest their labor carry the same weight as those who invest their capital when it comes to strategic decisions. Let us fool ourselves no longer: left to their own devices, most capital investors will not care for the dignity of labour investors, nor will they lead the fight against environmental catastrophe. Another option is available. Democratise firms decommodify work stop treating human beings as resources so that we can focus together on sustaining life on this planet.• Isabelle Ferreras (University of LouvainFNRS-Harvard LWP), Julie Battilana (Harvard University), Dominique Méda (University of Paris Dauphine PLS), Julia Cagé (Sciences Po-Paris), Lisa Herzog (University of Groningen), Sara Lafuente Hernandez (University of Brussels-ETUI), Hélène Landemore (Yale University), Pavlina Tcherneva (Bard College-Levy Institute), Miranda Richmont Mouillot, Israr Qureshi (Autralian National University), Clare Wright (La Trobe University), Isabelle Martin (University of Montréal), Neera Chandhoke (Delhi University), Lukas Clark-Memler (University of Oxford), Alberto Alemanno (HEC Paris-NYU Law), Elizabeth Anderson (University of Michigan), Philippe Askénazy (CNRS-Paris School of Economics), Aurélien Barrau (CNRS et Université Grenoble-Alpes), Adelle Blackett (McGill University), Neil Brenner (Harvard University), Craig Calhoun (Arizona State University), Ha-Joon Chang (University of Cambridge), Erica Chenoweth (Harvard University), Joshua Cohen (Apple University, Berkeley, Boston Review), Christophe Dejours (CNAM), Olivier De Schutter (UCLouvain, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights), Nancy Fraser (The New School for Social Research, NYC), Archon Fung (Harvard University), Javati Ghosh (Jawaharlal Nehru University), Stephen Gliessman (UC Santa Cruz), Hans R.

But we can’t let classrooms reignite coronavirusEver since Boris Johnson announced that he wanted England’s schools to reopen at the start of June – just over two weeks away – the government has been on a collision course with teachers. In deciding to bring back reception and year 1 children first, aged just four to six years, he has chosen the group of pupils who will find social distancing most difficult.Of course, after seven weeks of lockdown, it’s understandable that Britain needs a roadmap to easing the restrictions, and schools are key in allowing parents to return to the workplace. At some point, classes will have to reopen. But what I’ve found baffling is that, given the messages we’ve been hearing from the government since 23 March about staying home and saving lives, it has somehow become unpatriotic for teachers to question the speed and safety of the return to class. It’s important to try and keep fit and healthy during lockdown, but why should “teacher shaming” be the new stay-at-home sport?In the House of Commons this week, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, accused concerned teachers of “scaremongering”, saying: “Making people fear is really unfair and not a welcome pressure that is to be placed on families, children and teachers alike.”My old English teacher Mary Bousted, now the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, seems to be a prime target. She’s a wonderful person and got me through my O-level years ago, but yesterday she was accused of “working against the interests of children” and today of being a “Corbynite lover of communist Cuba” in the Daily Mail. Also in the Mail, and in language perhaps reminiscent of his time as defence secretary, Williamson urged teachers to “do their duty”. So it is perhaps worth considering what public duty looks like in a time of enormous crisis and mortal risk.I supported the lockdown and the blood-curdling emergency legislation that followed it. I swallowed more authoritarian measures than I could ever have imagined in the fight against an invisible – but very real and deadly – enemy. I even tried to bite my tongue at the lack of preparedness for and early handling of the pandemic. I didn’t want to dent ministerial morale if it would do more harm than good.But as the death toll rises, we are still waiting for a comprehensive testing and tracing strategy and proper personal protective equipment for all our frontline health and social care workers (let alone for those in transport, construction and other sectors now being told to work). Rightwing libertarians balk at the policing of social distancing in parks and beauty spots, but seem to care little about the lack of health and safety enforcement in unsafe places of work. For a sense of perspective, only 70,000 UK civilians perished during the whole of the second world war. No need to “scaremonger”. Every day’s numbers speak for themselves.So what does public duty look like for those making life-and-death decisions in government, for teachers’ representatives and for every concerned citizen? It surely means trying to learn from evidence, experience and even past mistakes. It means asking pertinent questions before putting more people in harm’s way and creating new “frontlines” of infection. Right now, Britain doesn’t have the ability to even monitor the spread of the virus, let alone keep it under control.What is the scientific basis for assuming that children don’t spread coronavirus? How can social distancing really be made to work with small children in particular? We don’t need intemperate attacks on those who ask questions or speak inconvenient truth to power.Some say that if doctors are putting themselves at risk, why shouldn’t teachers? With around 150,000 people carrying the virus, which remains both highly infectious and as deadly as ever, surely we don’t need more people on the frontline? If primary schools were to become hotbeds of virus spreading as children and teachers return to their homes and families each evening, I suspect that health workers would not thank teachers, parents or ministers for this show of solidarity.Others talk of opening primary schools in purely economic terms, as if a “healthy economy” can somehow be immunised from a health catastrophe. More sympathetic voices put the needs of children’s education and wellbeing front and centre. But even if children seem to suffer less from the virus directly, their wellbeing cannot thrive were they to innocently infect their parents, teachers and communities.So why this special venom for our teachers? Why do we trust these professionals to care for and educate our precious youngsters, but not to consider school safety? I asked an old schoolfriend, now a headteacher of a secondary school, working night and day to make sure his most vulnerable kids get the best support possible. He talks of the profession as “long being maligned and misunderstood (always on holiday, go home at three, etc)”. And he worries about the long-term consequences of the current bout of shaming on morale, retention and recruitment for the future.I can’t help wondering why these wonderful people, who teach us to read, write, care and question, are being vilified and not applauded for their service.• Lady Shami Chakrabarti was shadow attorney general for England and Wales from 2016 to 2020, and was director of Liberty from 2003 to 2016"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1925093e8752a701728402bac9392ba78fcd6559/10_10_5066_3040/master/5066.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=89d79a672f96b6be2f45b583b636d7fe","title":"nature lockdown summer holidays","story":"Summer holidays abroad look doomed, but there is comfort and reward to be found just by being curious about your surroundingsIt’s likely that we will all be spending time in our local areas for the foreseeable future and taking our holidays in our home countries rather than abroad. Could we bring to these experiences the same kind of curiosity we might feel when visiting a different city or landscape? Is it possible to find dynamism and novelty in our parks, streets and woodlands?During lockdown, I’ve come to know my nearest green spaces – my favourite a wild but urban cemetery – more deeply and gratefully. Instead of becoming bored, as I imagined I might, I’ve found that my local natural areas feel like new destinations each day, even by the hour, for nature is in constant flux. Bird songs are richest at dawn and dusk. The wild garlic smells stronger when the soil is warm. The nettles glow Kermit-green when the sun is low in the sky. The scarlet pimpernel shows itself when light and humidity are just so.Our lives are made from the things we pay attention to. Slowing down and observing – these are radical things to do in our accelerated age. It is only by being in lockdown that I have seen new treasures that I’d previously have overlooked: the bright pink cones of the larch tree, blankets of blue speedwell, neon red velvet mites. The more we pay attention, the more we see.The senses can help us notice more. I have heard a cuckoo twice this last week for the first time since childhood, in two different spots. It must be a combination of fewer aircraft and cars, and a craving and alertness for as much life as possible during that precious time outside.A rainy day will put a lot of people off a walk – though it often looks worse from the inside and woods look more beautiful when wet – but the smell of petrichor, the scent of the earth after it has rained, is worth seeking. It has been found to activate brain waves associated with calmness and relaxation.Sometimes I choose one element to focus on. It might be different shades of green, leaf shapes, the colours of stalks, lichen, tiny things, an abundance of things, things becoming other things. Every day there is a new “fellow” to look for, as my three-year-old puts it. In Hampshire, where I am, it might be swifts, mayflies, damselflies, speckled wood butterflies, slow worms, beetles, caterpillars. People are heterogeneous. You might love fungi I might love spiders. Find what you like.If you’re sheltering inside, houseplants, bird feeders outside a window, or a view of sunlight filtering through the leaves of a tree (the Japanese word for this is komorebi) can be therapeutic – and suggests that in resilient and fair societies everyone should be able to see nature from their windows, especially those without gardens.Over the last number of years I’ve spent writing Losing Eden, a book about nature and mental health, I’ve seen how crucial a connection with the living world is for our minds – and, on the flipside, that building eco-alienated human habitats and societies, where people have little access to nature, is unfair and a public health disaster. In recent years, psychologists are revealing the importance of noticing “nearby nature” and connecting with the living world for our wellbeing rather than simply spending time outdoors. Noticing nature is linked to pro-environmental behaviour. If we feel a kinship, we are more likely to seek a reciprocal relationship with other beings.The evidence that contact with nature – even a view out of a window – can enhance healing continues to grow. Nature might even be a balm for those dealing with loss and loneliness. At an ecotherapy group I attended while researching my book, a man shared how methodically noticing the plants on a daily walk helped him grieve. Many of us are frightened, bored, or missing loved ones, and watching spring unfurl can be a healthy kind of escapism. When the news feels overwhelming, the rhythms and patterns outside can be a steadying arm: the swifts returning, the tightly orchestrated symphony of wildflowers, the trees filling out.I’ve been noticing nature for a while, and I’ve only scratched the surface. Each season I’m surprised by new sights, which become familiar moments the following year, joined by other new happenings, layering upon each other. I think moving into a new kind of consciousness – a “plant consciousness”, as Richard Powers puts it – could be a lifelong journey, and a good one.You can find the wild near your home. You can find your place in the family of things, to use the poet Mary Oliver’s phrase. There is magic in the seemingly mundane. If you want more, you can find more.

Someone else jumps in the air and somehow manages to remove his hoodie with his foot, landing on his feet and looking shocked. A golden retriever appears to be dancing on their hind legs. A son opens a box that his deceased father left him for his 18th birthday. Families assemble in formation and do dances made famous by other people on the internet. Ant and Dec throw progressively larger things at each others’ heads underneath the caption: “Day 37 of lockdown”.TikTok is the medium of global lockdowns. It is perfect for a splintered attention  that is suddenly plunged into a boredom so extreme that nothing in particular will satiate it. I can’t even watch TV any more, people are saying. But 15 seconds of a koala sleeping followed by 15 seconds of a teenager dancing with his grandmother feels doable. Throughout lockdown, headlines have been describing TikTok as a perfect distraction from lockdown conditions, but I don’t think that’s quite right. It doesn’t distract so much as reflect the conditions back to us. TikToks are often compelling precisely because they capture the experience of isolation – the creative ingenuity that can come of it the drive to entertain ourselves and others the desire for a tenuous connection to a generalised world.A lot of the videos, especially those made by young people, are inflected with what I can only think of as a powerful yearning, for an audience, of course, but also for a way to pass the time. They play dress-up, invent dances, imitate movie characters, and dye half their hair blond or purple (#lockdownlewks). Watching TikToks while I was bored one day, I had the thought that many of them are fundamentally artefacts of boredom, tedium-made material. You might wonder who has the time to make them, as you while away hours watching teens who haven’t seen their friends in months playing multiple parts in skits about their lives.TikTok doesn’t feel like a rabbit hole. Instagram is one endless boring scroll through advertisements and ex-friends’ anniversary posts, and Twitter is a vortex you could tumble down for hours, into jokes and arguments and jokes about the arguments. TikTok, where the dominant feed is not your friends but a “For You” feed curated algorithmically, is more like a deluge. Everything is disconnected, everything is orced from context, everything is fragmented and vaguely miraculous, everything is so fast that it doesn’t feel like it’s stealing your time. Everything is even more ephemeral than usual: the archive is so difficult to search that it can be hard to locate TikToks you might have seen just yesterday. There isn’t even the artificially generated nostalgia of resurfaced content on Facebook. It is a kind of eternal present.There is a lot of silliness on TikTok. There is also plenty of darkness, often cut with humour. In one video I can’t stop watching, someone with the handle @kindakyle is dancing robotically, accompanied by a rainbow strobe effect. Overlaid text reads: “when tik tok has made your attention  so poor that you cant watch youtube videos or netflix anymore bc you arent getting the instant gratification that you can get from this app and you also cant study for more than 5 mins and lose interest in conversations extremely quickly and now you basically have the mental capacity of a hamster and cant focus on one thing to save your life !! zoo wee mama !!”This has become a sort of meme: young people imagining and acting out what their TikTok use might be doing to their brains, and then performing it on the app itself. The young people making these videos are funny and self-aware and creative and sad. It’s hard to watch and it’s also hard to stop watching. The videos repeat and repeat.• Sophie Haigney writes about technology and culture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19abb1b1a0a90bcf5766f95efb4e90228ca13941/0_157_4747_2846/master/4747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66bb408abd6444989bdded0779369103","title":"england plans to send the wrong children back to school at the wrong time","story":"The reopening of schools doesn’t seem to be about safety or learning – so what is it about?We have built a world where parents need the childcare provided by the school system. In some families parents are working at night, or rising at 5am to sustain a struggling business before their children wake up. They may more urgently feel the need for schools to reopen than those who can happily juggle a few hours of homeschooling with working from home.But think about what primary teachers are facing with the prospect of suddenly going back to school with gaggles of five- and six-year-olds. As one infant teacher said on the radio this week: “We’ll have six classes back, so we need at least 12 classrooms, but only have nine. The government has admitted we can’t socially distance, so they’re playing with our health. We are taking the children’s toys away, because they have to be constantly cleaned, what will they do all day? I’ve got four pages of issues like this!”On the other hand, a headteacher on the same show said: “Sitting around saying it’s too hard is no model for our young people.” Solutions had to be found.Schools are now hurriedly buying washing troughs and putting up sanitiser stations. Marking parent drop-off areas. Deep-cleaning canteens. Children will play in chalked circles on playgrounds. For a moment it sounds doable. But then, a child coughs in a narrow corridor another falls and hurts his knee. He’s crying, it’s bleeding. A child with special needs requires help with feeding and there is no protective equipment. And what happens if there’s a fight?Now imagine: it’s your daughter, your husband, or your best friend who is teaching. Are you happy for them to jump into these situations? It is too easy to be dismissive about low potential harm unless it’s your loved one taking the risk. It is vital that trade unions question hard and push for the safest possible conditions before schools can reopen.Certainty on safety is not possible, though. The virus is still mysterious and new complexities may yet arise. The experts have admitted a vaccine may never come. But imagine: it is your home at risk because you can’t work, or your sanity dwindling from the 57th day of home schooling, or your six-year-old sobbing because they miss their friends. Your heart’s calculator may now calibrate the risks differently. Schools reopening, at least in some form, would be a lifeline. We need to be smart about this.In Italy, Spain and Ireland schoolchildren will not return until autumn at the earliest. Wales and Scotland are leaning the same way. Yet, in England, politicians are putting their efforts into fighting with the unions for an early return – and one that initially offers just three year groups a poor, socially distanced, in-a-school-but-not-really-school experience for, at best, six weeks before the end of term.Meanwhile, many parents will still be unable to work because they have a child in another year group stuck at home but now have the added complexity of a heavily sanitised school run on top of it all.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary in England, should stop looking for fights. Instead, he should pause, and focus schools on doing distance learning really well by setting minimum standards for the remainder of the academic year. It seems right, for example, that every child should speak with a teacher at least once a week and receive meaningful feedback on work they have completed during that time.Why this approach has been missed is not clear. The Department for Education’s own scientific adviser admits he hasn’t seen any modelling around reopening schools and says the evidence on transmission is mixed. Is this about getting people back to work, or is it a classic Conservative trick of fuelling union strife to ert public attention from government failings and aim it towards a profession with a well-protected salary?Whatever it is, it doesn’t seem to be about safety or learning. There are no easy answers but Williamson can find smarter solutions. The question is whether he has the courage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3445db5b02f61da1ce4266182de2bdf4c74c32fc/0_83_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cdff7b0cc8845d8b0d5cd148119f1d3","title":"teaching unions vow to work with ministers to reopen english schools","story":"NASUWT chief says he backs government’s 1 June timetable if schools can be made ‘Covid-secure’Teaching unions say they are willing to work with the government to begin reopening schools in England as long as it can be done safely, amid concerns about a renewed coronavirus outbreak.The debate over Boris Johnson’s decision to return some primary pupils to classrooms on 1 June has grown increasingly acrimonious after the British Medical Association (BMA) backed teaching unions who said the government was moving too quickly.Pressure on the unions increased after the children’s commissioner for England called on the two sides to “stop squabbling” and agree on a plan. Anne Longfield said she was in “despair” at the increasingly entrenched positions being taken by the two sides, and that the interests of children were being ignored. However, Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT union, said members supported schools reopening provided they could be made “Covid secure” and it would not put public health at risk. Discussions between unions and government scientific advisers took place on Friday. However, the meeting was inconclusive and critics of the government’s plan said it raised more questions than answers.Roach said teachers needed unequivocal guidance from the government that there would be strong controls in place that would satisfy both teachers and parents that it was safe to return.“We are continuing to say to government but also to schools and employers, that we are here, we want to work with those employers to put plans in place to see whether schools can be ready for reopening from 1 June,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We want schools to be reopened, we want children to be safe and we want staff to be safe. It is not a zero-sum game here. It is about ensuring that we get back to a place where we can return to some form of normality.” Longfield said that until a vaccine was found there would have to be a managed approach to risk. “My worry within all that is that the needs of children and the best interests of children are disappearing from view,” she told Today. “There are really strong reasons why children need to get back into school. It is really imperative to see the can-do willingness to work together that we have seen in other parts of society.“None of us want to put children, or indeed staff or parents, into any kind of situation that is unsafe. But until we get a vaccine we are going to have to be managing risk.”Prof Sir Mark Walport, the chief executive of UK Research and Innovation and a former government chief scientific adviser, said ministers were taking a cautious approach and that a similar phased reopening in Denmark had not led to an increase in the transmission rate of the disease.“It is very harmful for children and complicated for families if their children aren’t in school,” he told Today. “It is clear that although children do get infected – and the evidence is that they are infected probably as often as older people – nevertheless they show less symptoms and almost certainly transmit less than older people. “Class sizes are being kept low, not all school years are going back, so it is being done in a very cautious fashion.” Meanwhile, another English council has publicly stated it would oppose the government’s timetable. Hartlepool borough council said: “Given that coronavirus cases locally continue to rise, the council has been working with schools and we have agreed they will not reopen on Monday 1 June. “While we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this. We continue to work with schools to put in place appropriate measures to help keep children and staff safe when a phased reopening is possible.” Hartlepool’s statement followed confirmation that Liverpool’s schools would only be open to vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers on 1 June.The BMA, the UK’s largest doctors’ union, said in a letter to the National Education Union on Friday that the number of coronavirus infections remained too high to allow them to run safely. Teaching unions had been “absolutely right” to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening schools on 1 June, it said.“We cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK,” the BMA council’s chair, Chaand Nagpaul, said in the letter to his NEU counterpart, Kevin Courtney."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32fa345f42689d9f7ea7fa2ca2572b8d7ce42a45/870_466_1625_975/master/1625.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b8f8e8b51455d2cafdf4f81a4907aec8","title":"how urban planners preference for male trees has made your hay fever worse","story":"Horticulturists urge better sex mix of city trees to mitigate rising asthma and CO2 pollution levelsEight years ago Tom Ogren, a horticulturist, was in Sacramento, California, when he noticed that the ground around the State Capitol building was covered in thick yellow pollen.Scanning the trees along the street with his binoculars, he saw the trees were all deodar cedars (Cedrus deodara) and all cultivated males.Naturally, the deodar is monoecious, having both male and female cones growing on the same tree. But cultivation has produced wholly male trees – plants favoured by planners since they have no seeds or pods to drop but only pollen. This was the case at this Sacramento site, Ogren said.Growers’ breeding of purely male diodar trees had created, said Ogren, “something that doesn’t even exist in nature”.Ogren said he had seen similar pollen-coated cityscapes in Christchurch, New Zealand, London, UK, and all over Canada. “Everywhere I’ve gone, same situation,” he said.Male trees are often favoured by urban landscape planners as female trees can shed fruit as well as seeds and pods.Pollen producing trees that are dioecious (with male and female flowers on separate plants) are seen to add to the effect of allergies of city dwellers .Today, hay fever affects more than 400 million people worldwide. More than 300 million people have asthma, often an effect of hay fever, and that number is expected to rise by 100 million by 2025.Allergenic tree pollen was found to be one of the biggest contributors to hay fever and asthma, and pollen counts have also been rising over the past 15 years.This health issue is going largely unaddressed despite there being a simple solution: a bigger mix of male and female trees in urban areas.While some cities were beginning to catch on, Ogren said, getting the methodology widely adopted was an uphill battle.He began researching allergenic plants and trees more than 30 years ago, when, with his wife, he moved to San Luis Obispo, California. His wife developed terrible allergies, he said. After studying the flora in their neighbourhood he understood the reason – all the tree species were males.Trees can be one of three sexes – monecious, dioecious male or dioecious female. Naturally, there is a relatively even split between all three, so the amount of pollen wafted into the air is regulated. But when dioecious males are planted independently of dioecious females, as often the case in urban areas, their pollen is unchecked by any capture by female flowers.Landscape plans of cities across the US revealed the planting pattern to Ogren. When he dug deeper he found a note in the 1949 USDA Yearbook of Agriculture reading: “When used for street plantings only male trees should be selected, to avoid the nuisance from the seed.” He said it was “botanical sexism”.Ogren added that when Dutch elm disease wiped out a portion of America’s elm trees in the late 1960s urban landscapers ordered more than 100 varieties of male maple clones as replacements then other male varieties followed. Since cloning proved quicker than waiting for trees to pollinate and grow naturally, male clones began to dominate the tree nurseries too. It was not just in the US. Ogren saw the same trend wherever he travelled.By 2000 Ogren had collected so much data on tree species he was able to create his Ogren Plant Allergy Scale (Opals). It was the first numerical ranking system in existence for plant allergies. It is now used by the USDA Urban and Community Forestry programme to develop allergy rankings in large US cities.Nigel Clarke, one of the UK’s largest distributors of female trees, met Ogren at a plant workshop in Guernsey and they began to help each other with a mutual mission – mitigation of urban tree pollen.“If plant distributors, by their plant choices, are responsible for the rising numbers of allergy sufferers in urban areas, then we, by making the correct plant choices, can at least reduce the amount of allergenic pollen in the air,” said Clarke. Now, he said, he tagged all his trees using Opals to ensure his buyers were better informed.Ogren’s work has also had an impact in several cities in Canada, where he was commissioned to do a tree allergy audit. The town of Hamilton, for example, has adopted more allergy-friendly urban planting policies, largely due to Peter Prakke, a nurseryman who has been advocating allergy-free schoolyards and public parks for the past 10 years, using Ogren’s work as a guide.Vancouver, Edmonton and Halifax are also working towards balancing their tree populations so as to reduce allergies. But these are only small pockets of success. Clifford Bassett, founder of Allergy and Asthma Care, of New York, said: “I see a growing number of patients each year who suffer from seasonally triggered allergies. Warmer temperatures, the longer pollen season, and rising carbon dioxide levels are likely to contribute to increasing sensitisation to pollen.”Studies have shown that air pollution particulates attach to pollen grains, which causes the powdery substance to shatter into still tinier pieces. “When that happens the inside of the pollen grain is exposed and that’s 10 times more allergenic than the outside,” explained Ogren.Ogren suggested that all sufferers should get together and “demand protection” as “a basic human right”, adding: “We could have pollen-free lawns, hedges, trees, all of this, it’s all doable, but only if enough people know about it and if the right people raise enough fuss about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e024ddf236a4863009a827b9630e08ec94e57f4b/0_0_3397_2265/master/3397.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e3e7cbbca1a28f48cca0ba25a2451e","title":"women make film review mark cousins 14 hour documentary","story":"Mark Cousins’s 14-hour documentary gives a voice to film-makers excluded from the cultural conversationPerhaps it’s because of the way that time seems confoundingly elastic during lockdown, but the 14-hour running time of Mark Cousins’s epic journey through the cinema of women no longer seems quite so daunting. A long-haul voyage of discovery that s 13 decades, five continents and 183 female film-makers, this absorbing film might be the closest thing we’ll get to an escape for quite some time.Cousins’s marathon essay is pitched as “a film school of sorts, in which all the teachers are women”. This is not entirely accurate. At least one of the teachers is Cousins himself: it is he who selects the curriculum and who shapes the lessons. This is not a comprehensive list of female directors it’s a view of cinema history that is filtered through his taste. Fortunately Cousins’s taste is broad and adventurous, his passion infectious.The approach is more concerned with the craft of film-making than with personalities, biographies and the politics that saw so many female film-makers drowned out of the cultural conversation over the years. It addresses 40 questions in 40 chapters, through illustrative clips from big hitters (Kathryn Bigelow, Ava DuVernay, Jane Campion) and numerous lesser-known names (Cousins is a particularly vocal cheerleader for Ukrainian director Kira Muratova).And it’s here, in the glimpses culled from careers curtailed by indifference, that politics is implicit. The narration, delivered by, among others, Tilda Swinton, Jane Fonda and Thandie Newton, but written by Cousins, is prone to fervour at times. The word “masterpiece” is used so often it starts to feel like the plastic medals that get handed out at children’s birthday parties. But the work speaks for itself and the fact that it is not more widely known is a tragedy. I was particularly struck by the exuberant kitsch of the films of British director Wendy Toye, who won a prize at Cannes but was unknown to me until I watched this film. What Cousins offers here is a map to a whole world of undiscovered cinema.

I remember going on adventures with my older brother and, when I was 11, being allowed to go to the corner shop alone, and filling up a bag with penny chews, Fruit Salads, Bruiser bars and Black Jacks.My parents fostered about 100 children from when I was four onwards. Some stayed for 24 hours and some for 13 years. We were always getting folding chairs out of the garage and budging up to make space at the table or putting another jacket potato in the oven.My parents tended to cook big batch food because there was always the possibility that other children would turn up with their carrier bag and shoes and we had to gently bring them out of their shells. One of the big catalysts for that was firstly sitting them at the table and eating with them. Only as an adult do I understand the emotional significance and security of that.I’d been at the end of my tether as a single mother writing a political blog. Then I became a trainee reporter on the Southend Echo. I can tell you exactly what I ate then at my desk – pasta with butter and the occasional scotch egg, out of Tupperware. I had basically no money until my first pay cheque came through, but when it did I put some chicken in my pasta. And some cheese, if I was being profligate.I remember when my mother first took me to a proper hairdresser, instead of having her friend Julie round, or my nan’s friend Lois to trim my fringe at the dining table. He was Barry at Legend in the town centre. It was the first time I had biscotti with tea and I said, embarrassingly, “These biscuits are really hard”, when they were meant to be.Last night I ate a whole family-size macaroni cheese. I’d planned to put half back in the fridge. I have a surprisingly large appetite anyway and I don’t drive, I walk everywhere, I don’t sit down at the moment and I pace the hallway when I’m on the phone. I think that if I didn’t eat large amounts of carbs and cheese I would wither away into a husk.I did take testosterone for six to nine months and I was very hungry and very randy all the time. A most dangerous combination. I stopped – and I’ve got to be careful how I word this – basically, I got as far down that path as I wanted to go. I never wished to transition to be a man, I just wanted to knock some of my edges off. The thing about testosterone is that when you stop taking it, you soften back up again, although I’ve still got a few extra hairs on my chin which will never go away. But what that period taught me is that I’m pretty comfortable in this skin as it is. But I think if I hadn’t done it – and my story is in no way representative of other people – it would have driven me mad.If I’ve learned anything in the last seven or eight years it’s that my career flies by the seat of my pants and that every time I’m booked for something, I’m ill, and anything – like a TV opportunity – I treat as my last ever one because it’s maybe my swansong. It’s impossible to plan for the future and I don’t take anything for granted. I’m consistently surprised when I’m commissioned to do anything, despite appearances.My back-up plan, if everything dries up, is going back to the supermarket, where I’ve worked before. I’ll sit on the checkout and, as food passes, I’ll say: “Do you know what you could do with that? I have a great recipe for that.”FoodIn my nan’s spare bedroom I found a row of Jilly Cooper novels and in one it said that the female protagonist had a body which looked like it had been raised entirely on tinned peaches. I thought, “Great, that’s a diet I can go with”, and I’ve noshed down on them ever since.DrinkI gave up a year-and-a-half ago. I’ve fallen off the wagon, in a minor way, a couple of times since but think I’ve got a handle on it.

His voice is grainy with hurt and, even on Skype, his eyes glisten. “You don’t want your parents to see you in a lot of pain.”The former Italy striker, who played for and managed Chelsea, pauses because the tears have choked him. Vialli is at his home in Chelsea, where he is in lockdown with his wife and two teenage daughters. His elderly parents live in Cremona, the town in northern Italy which has been hit so hard by the coronavirus. He cannot talk as he remembers why he did not tell them when he was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2017.I break the silence because it’s understandable he would not wish his parents to suffer. “Yes,” the 55-year-old agrees as he composes himself. “There is also all this shame. I’ve always been perceived as a tough guy. A strong guy with a lot of determination. To not be in that position made me uneasy. I didn’t want to be looked at as a poor guy with a disease. That’s why I didn’t share it widely for 12 months.“It’s also a burden. People will call to show they’re thinking about you. I thought that, instead of spending time on the phone, I needed time for myself. That’s why I wore a jumper under the shirt – to hide that I’d lost so much weight. These feelings are natural and stay with you a while. And then, at least in my case, they go away. The day you start looking at things differently, your life changes. Now I show my scars with pride. They are a sign of what I’ve been through.”Vialli played 59 matches for Italy. He helped Sampdoria win the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1990 and their first Serie A title a year later. He lifted another Scudetto and the Champions League with Juventus. That 1996 final was his last game before he became a Chelsea player and then their manager during his four years at Stamford Bridge.He has always been amiable and intelligent but, over the course of a 70-minute conversation, Vialli emerges as an even more impressive man. “I know now that you need to let out the pain,” he says. “I wasn’t particularly good at showing my emotions and I kept things inside. It’s not good. Now I realise that whenever I want to cry, I cry. There’s no shame. And if you want to laugh, you laugh. I try not to cry in front of people that might get very emotional. I try to cry by myself. When I’m in a comfortable place, I don’t hold anything inside. I just let it out, and I feel better afterwards.”Vialli is remarkably comfortable in this interview, even when reflecting on the closeness of death and revealing that he now faces tests every three months to check whether he is still clear of the disease. He nods in acknowledgement when I ask if his past as a footballer prevented him from expressing his emotions before cancer turned his life inside out. “Yes. We portrayed ourselves as tough guys that could deal with anything without showing any weakness. But I now realise the power of vulnerability and that, actually, it can be a powerful tool to get inside people’s hearts. It creates empathy – and empathy is everything. I’m not ashamed of saying we all cry – sometimes because we are scared. In my case I was crying because I was scared of the unknown. I did not know whether I was going to be fine or not. It’s different than if you cry because you’ve lost a match.”He laughs wryly at the fleeting pain of football. Vialli’s outlook on life has clearly changed over the past three years – while he has endured two separate nine-month spells of chemotherapy, which eventually led to his being declared cancer-free last December.“This is my personal view,” Vialli says. “But my friends, people who eventually knew about my condition, said: ‘Come on, you’re going to win this fight. You can beat cancer.’ I always felt I didn’t want to fight cancer, because it would be too big and powerful an enemy. I felt this is a journey. It’s about the right therapies and the right doctors. It’s about travelling with an unwanted travel companion until hopefully it gets bored and dies before me.”Vialli is in a philosophical mood as we discuss his new book, Goals, which features 90 stories about inspirational sportsmen and women who overcame adversity. They range from Jackie Robinson and Jesse Owens to Billie Jean King and Natalie du Toit, Alex Zanardi and Emil Zatopek to LeBron James and Ronda Rousey. They read even more powerfully at a time of great crisis for the world, as each story is preceded by a mantra of hope.“That’s the key mantra,” Vialli says. “It’s all about the way we deal with situations. Alex could’ve gone into a depression, but why focus on the negative? In my situation, I was shocked when I heard I had cancer. But then I thought: ‘I’ve got to make this a journey that helps me grow. I don’t always see it that way, but that’s my aim.”The book ends with the most compelling story – as Vialli details how two bouts of cancer and chemotherapy affected him. “I found out that pancreatic cancer is one of the worst cancers,” he recalls. “So I was shocked, confused, helpless, hopeless. But it helped that I’d been an athlete. I was used to getting injured and so with cancer I could say: ‘Operation? When? You’re discharging me? When? Then I’m starting chemo? For how long?’ For me it was about setting goals. I also know that nothing is permanent and it will all pass.”Vialli would learn another brutal truth. Remission can be temporary. His cancer came back in March 2019. “We thought everything was going OK. And then, all of a sudden, you get a temperature. You go for a blood test and they say: ‘Let’s make sure there’s nothing sinister.’ I found out then. It was back.”Vialli leans closer to the screen. “To be honest,” he says, “I asked myself: ‘Did you really think you were going to get away with cancer that easily?’ The second time was definitely tougher because it’s the cumulative effect. I wasn’t so strong and there was some despair. You’re thinking: ‘Oh my God, this guy is back.’”Another nine blurring months of chemotherapy passed and, in December 2019, Vialli was given fresh hope. “They call it NED,” he explains. “No evidence of disease. I’m perfectly aware it will take a while before I’m given the all clear. Unfortunately, these things have a tendency to come back. But at the moment I am in a good place. I hope to stay in a good place until I die of old age.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200512-56802-gnl.fsof.200513.jf.Fascism.mp3 Vialli has anxious days when he worries if the cancer will return. But he spends more time talking about gratitude. “I’ve learned that gratitude is a very powerful emotion. And I’m very grateful to many wonderful people – my wife and family and all the people who have looked after me. They’re not just competent and knowledgeable. They really feel what you’re going through and there’s a great deal of empathy. I’m looked after at the Royal Marsden in Chelsea. It’s an amazing hospital.”Has it been difficult to maintain such positivity amid Covid-19? “For me it has been hard because I come from Cremona. It probably has the highest death rate in the region. In a way I feel I should be there with my people. I felt so bad reading that people were dying in hospital without their loved ones. It’s a tragedy.“Staying at home in Chelsea is not a problem. I can work remotely. I can walk to the park. My wife and daughters are here and it’s great to be with them 247. In London I only know two people that tested positive. Thank God I have not lost anyone I know in this country. But it’s different in Cremona where there are only 80,000 people. London has six million people. You feel it more in a smaller place.”What does Vialli think of the Premier League trying to resume next month? “In times of grief, and when you’re going through a difficult situation like this, some psychologists say we should try to do things that give us pleasure without feeling guilty about it. So if football could be a tool to give people some relief then I look forward to its return.“That said, I can only imagine what the players are feeling. I could advise them about injury or when they fall out with the manager. I can share my experiences with them. But in this situation I wouldn’t know what to tell them. This is unprecedented. If I was still a player, I would probably find it difficult to focus on football because people are still dying.”Since last October he has worked alongside Roberto Mancini, his former Sampdoria teammate, who now manages Italy. “I have started this new chapter as the head of the Italian national team football delegation. I am so happy I’ve ended up working with my best friend. It feels great to be able to help Roberto and I love trying to inspire the players. My contract runs to the end of the World Cup in Qatar in December 2022. We are carrying on and trying to do as much as possible.”It seems fitting that Vialli should express his optimism before we say goodbye. “I must think positively,” he says. “I’ve also got to acknowledge when I have some negative thoughts. Acknowledge, separate and challenge them. Yes, I am positive personally. I am also positive about the world. The crisis will pass. What I’d like to see next is that we do not forget these lessons.“If you look at climate change we have a chance to do something about it. We are now saying health is the most important thing. Great. Why, once the virus is gone, would we go back to living in a place where the air is so polluted? Why don’t we prevent people getting sick and dying from pollution? Surely we should be prepared to give up a little bit of our wealth, our so-called quality of life, for a safer and healthier planet? I feel very strongly about this kind of future.”Goals: Inspirational Stories to Help Tackle Life’s Challenges by Gianluca Vialli is published by Headline"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33cbf6b72ea072f0116d25d39988c675eb961476/348_859_3762_2259/master/3762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd88bba331e80d1febdbcc957373d516","title":"borussia dortmund v schalke bundesliga returns live","story":"46 min: Serdar has a whack from distance. It’s easy for Burki, but that’s as good as anything they did in the first half.Here we go again! Schalke have made a double change, and it’s an attacking gambit. Burgstaller comes on to add a bit of lumber to the attack he replaces injured defender Todibo. Raman makes way for Matondo up front.Dortmund are well in control of the Revierderby. They go off to a light smattering of uncertain applause, the sort Mike and Bernie Winters used to receive at the Glasgow Empire.Schubert shanks a dismal clearance straight at Delaney, who offloads to Brandt. The ball’s shuttled to Guerreiro, who strides into the box and lashes a low shot across the hapless keeper and into the bottom right. Schubert dips his head, as well he might. What a gift, though the finish was special. It’s Guerreiro’s sixth of the season.43 min: Kenny crosses low from the Schalke right. Harit prepares to shoot from the edge of the D. He’s clipped from behind by Hummels and goes over. But he doesn’t get the free kick. There wasn’t a lot of contact, true, but it was enough. Harit is furious, and nearly fumes his way into the book with a verbal volley at the ref. But we play on.41 min: From the corner, Dahoud has a crack from the best part of 30 yards. He catches it flush, and it’s going to take the net off the frame of the goal, but Sane bravely gets in the way to flick over the bar. Ooyah, oof, that’s gotta hurt. The next corner is a non-event.40 min: Brandt creams a diagonal pass towards Hakimi on the right. Hakimi’s in acres, and strides into the box. He’s got Guerreiro and Haaland to his left, but opts to shoot instead. The ball pings off Nastasic and away for a corner. He should have laid it off.38 min: A break in play as Todibo gets a bit of treatment. Not sure what for. Shock, perhaps. Hakimi is some prospect.36 min: Hakimi zips down the right flank and gets to a ball he had no right to reach. He hooks it back from the byline, with Todibo in close attendance, and finds Guerreiro, who slices high and wide left from the edge of the box. Chances are Guerreiro was as surprised as anyone else that Hakimi kept that in.34 min: Dortmund are well on top now. Imagine the noise if the Yellow Wall was in situ. “A bit like watching soundcheck, this,” suggests Grant Tennille. “Not that that necessarily precludes heavy-metal football.”32 min: Schalke have been rocked by the quality of that goal. They’re struggling to clear their heads, and to retain possession.30 min: That’s Haaland’s tenth Bundesliga goal of the season, and it was a sensational move. He runs off to the corner flag, but there’s nobody there to celebrate with. Never mind, a huge smile plays across his face anyway. It didn’t take long for him to get back into the groove, did it?Who else? Erling Braut Haaland scores yet again, opening his body up to elegantly sidefoot Hazard’s right-wing cross into the bottom left. A gorgeous finish to a flowing move that started with Brandt sending Hazard away down the wing with a cute reverse flick26 min: Schalke have been quiet, but suddenly they explode into life, Oczipka whipping a cross in from the left. Akanji’s clearing header is dreadful, straight at Caligiuri, who nearly powers home at the far post. But Akanji does extremely well to get back and block, with a little help from Burki.25 min: Incidentally, just before the corner was taken, Haaland and Todibo received a mild ticking off from the referee for some garden-variety fussin’ and fightin’. A feud worth keeping an eye on.24 min: Brant sends it in. It’s only half cleared, and he gets another go to swing in from the right. Sane eyebrows the cross away from Hummels, who was preparing to head home from six yards. The ball breaks to Haaland at the far post. He lashes in his trademark fierce style into the side netting. Dortmund very close there.23 min: Hazard is brought down by Serdar as he dribbles down the left. A free kick just to the side of the D. Hakimi takes, but it’s straight at the wall and headed away from danger by Nastasic. But it’s at the expense of a corner, from which ...21 min: A lull, the first of the new era.19 min: Hummels faffs around on the halfway line, and is nearly stripped of possession by the buzzing Raman. He gets away with it. A lucky one, because if Raman won the block-tackle duel, he’d have been clean away.15 min: Dortmund are beginning to assert themselves now. Hazard flicks one round the corner to send Guerreiro skittering towards the Schalke box down the inside right. He’s got enough time and space to shoot when he enters the area, but his weak drag is easily blocked by Sane. It’s a corner, which turns out to be a total non-event.13 min: The exciting Hakimi goes on a tear down the right and whips a low ball into the six-yard box. Haaland is lurking at the far post, waiting to slam home, but Todibo slides in stylishly to hook clear, a sensational bit of defending. For a second, Schalke had been ripped open.12 min: After an interminable wait, it’s decided that Kenny was so close to Haaland that he could do nothing about the ball striking his hand. Something that was blatantly obvious from the get-go. Did you miss VAR?10 min: Hazard is upended mid-dribble down the right by Nastasic. Delaney hooks the free kick into the mixer. Haaland rises at the far post and tries to hook a shot around Kenny. The ball clanks onto Kenny’s hand. Haaland wants a penalty kick. The referee goes upstairs to find out what the deal is.9 min: Dortmund ping it around for a while to no great effect.7 min: It’s a bright start, this. How we’ve missed football. Hazard jigs down the inside right channel and has a whack from distance. He blazes the ball high into the empty stand.6 min: Caligiuri tries a curler towards the top left, but blooters the free kick straight into the wall.5 min: So this is good end to end fun. Harit dances down the middle and draws a clumsy foul from Dahoud. A free kick, just outside the D, in a very dangerous position.4 min: Having realised Schalke are playing at a higher tempo, Haaland tries to kick-start Dortmund into life with a burst down the inside-right channel. He nearly bursts through, but loses control just at the end, allowing Schubert to smother.3 min: Schalke press Dortmund hard. McKennie steals the ball in the midfield and feeds Raman down the inside left. For a second it looks as though there’ll be time for a shot, but he’s closed down by Hakimi and the danger’s over.2 min: Ah, that sports-centre five-a-side ambience. Dortmund knock it around the back in the training-ground style. Football really is all about the fans. But this is where we all are, and there’s no point harping on about it. Let’s enjoy it for what it is.Dortmund get the ball rolling! God speed, everyone.The teams are out! And it’s a positively psychedelic experience. No fans, just 200-odd people in the 81,000-capacity Westfalenstadion. The PA guy’s voice pinging off the walls like the hollow announcement of the last train home. And there’s been a last-minute change to the Dortmund team, with Thorgan Hazard taking the place of young Gio Reyna. We’ll be off in a few seconds!Pre-match chit-chat. “Hi Scott, hope you are well.” All good over here, Ruth Purdue, thanks for asking. Hope you’re well too. “Are you excited about seeing European football again as well as being conflicted about it at the same time?” Excited? Yes. Conflicted? Indeed. Although for some of us, football never ever stops, not really. It only seems like a couple of weeks ago when Stanley Matthews lifted the 1953 FA Cup. Strange times.Pre-bandwagon-jumping reading. Because, as Pjotr van Rooijen says: “We are all football hipsters now.”Giovanni Reyna, son of former Rangers, Sunderland and Manchester City midfielder Claudio, makes his first start for Dortmund. Thomas Delaney returns, while Jadon Sancho is left on the bench. Axel Witsel, Marco Reus, Emre Can, Nico Schulz and Dan-Axel Zagadou all miss out due to injury.Schalke welcome back Salif Sane, who makes his first appearance since injuring his knee last November. Jonjoe Kenny, on loan from Everton, starts, as does Barca loanee Jean-Clair Todibo. Ozan Kabak and Benjamin Stambouli miss out.Football’s back, baby! It’s back! Well, not in the UK, not yet. But over in Germany, the Bundesliga today becomes the first major ision to get back up and running in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. And what a place to pick things up again: Borussia Dortmund versus Schalke! The Revierderby! The rumble in the Ruhr! The noise in North Rhine-Westphalia! The ... hey, let us shake off some MBM rust, will you, it’s been a while. You get the gist.So about that rumble and noise ... BVB’s Westfalenstadion is arguably the most atmospheric ground in Europe, the Yellow Wall, all that. But not today. This game will be played behind closed doors, with only 213 people allowed in. That number takes in players, managers and staff, officials and ballboys, medical folk, camera operators and other assorted media types. There’ll be no handshakes, no team photos, no mascots. No cheering, no chanting. The rest of the 2019-20 Bundesliga season will be played out like this. Nine eerie games to go.The tragic realities of Covid-19 aside, this is a shame for a more trivial reason. The Revierderby has always generated one hell of an atmosphere. Take 1969, for example, when Schalke took the lead at Dortmund. Fans staged a celebratory pitch invasion, and were chased back into the stands by police dogs. Amid the brouhaha, an Alsatian sunk his teeth into the most padded portion of Schalke defender Friedel Rausch’s shorts. It later transpired that this particular hound had nothing to do with the police, but was brought in by a sassy Dortmund fan posing as a peeler to gain free entry! When Schalke hosted the reverse fixture later that season, their president Gunter Siebert responded to events by patrolling the pitch with a lion. Forget that miserable old saw about Germans having no sense of humour: this was, quite literally, satire with teeth.Fifty-one years on ... and the Dortmund of 2020 are chasing their first Bundesliga title since the Jurgen Klopp era since 2012 to be precise. They’re currently four points behind reigning champions Bayern Munich. Schalke are well off the pace in sixth spot, but if they can hinder their rivals’ title challenge this afternoon, it’ll make up for an awful lot. Schalke started the season well under new boss David Wagner, formerly of Huddersfield Town and Dortmund reserves, but the enforced break came at a good time for them: they’ve only won once in eight league games since the winter break, a 2-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach in January, and were recently battered 5-0 at home by RB Leipzig. Lucien Favre’s black and yellows, by contrast, are on a four-match winning run, though that comes with the obvious caveats and asterisks. The hosts will be the favourites today.And yet Schalke will take heart from their last two visits to the Westfalenstadion. In 2017, they came back from four goals down after 25 minutes to grab an absurd 4-4 draw, while they won 4-2 last season as Dortmund’s title bid spluttered out horribly. On both occasions, Dortmund had men sent off. They haven’t won this fixture since 2015. So despite the strange, sterile, mid-pandemic atmosphere, today’s Revierderby still has the potential to thrill. It’s Der BVB! It’s Die Knappen! It’s one of the biggest rivalries in world football! It is, once again, on!Kick-off: Too soon, some will undoubtedly say. But they’ll get the ball rolling at 3.30pm in Dortmund, 2.30pm UK time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/500e9fb692b831bbb5f9de85e5655d3d0e8d6307/1490_956_5552_3331/master/5552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f2018b602b77c60c9237ef881438d4c","title":"beans three ways a trio of recipes for your store cupboard staple","story":"As a nation it’s safe to say we are baked bean lovers, and for years families have been passing on their unique bean recipes. Anna Masing serves up three fresh dinner ideas and gets the family stories behind the recipesYou can’t beat mopping up that delicious sauce with a piece of bread after a fry-up. But beans have moved on from the cooked breakfast. People proudly boast about their personalised recipes and each generation adds a new twist to a family favourite. Whether it’s breakfast, lunch or dinner, there’s always room for beans on our plate.With increasing health concerns about the reduction of sugar in our diet, Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz lets this comfort food become a convenient staple for health-conscious people. Here are three recipes built from love and tradition for you to try.Recipe developer and food editor Nadine Brown makes this dish for her family – her partner, her eight-year-old daughter and two-year-old niece: “It’s perfect for a hungry family with little patience,” she says.The dish is based on a recipe Brown developed a few years ago, but with tweaks made specifically for her family. Beans have always been a favourite in their house: “They taste great on their own or in a dish like this,” Brown explains. “The basil goes deliciously with the tomatoes and beans,” she says, talking about working with flavours, and adding more vegetables helps to get the kids their five a day. The no added sugar version is also something that Brown is pleased about: “It helps me keep an eye on the amount of sugar we consume in the house.”This dish is also about ease – it’s a “bung it all in one” dinner. Cooked in one dish, it can be simply brought to the table, and makes cleaning up a breeze. This is a dish that features on the weekends in Brown’s household, when they don’t have to think about work or school and can enjoy spending time together eating a meal in a relaxed way.Ingredients8 pork sausages4 garlic cloves, skin on, lightly bashed1 tbsp olive oil2 red onions, cut into wedges1 red pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks1 green pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks2 x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz30g basil leaves, roughly torn300g cherry tomatoes on the vineFreshly cracked black pepperCrusty bread to serveMethodPreheat your oven to 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6.Add the sausages and garlic to a large, deep oven tray and drizzle with the oil.

Roz explains: “My mother made us minestrone regularly and this is an evolution of her recipe parmesan rind was suggested by an Italian friend. And baked beans was my addition.” For Zoe’s recipe, it has been about making tiny tweaks. “Mum has the recipe nailed so it’s hard to beat, but I add fried bacon, as the flavour melts into the whole dish, giving it a little extra depth and texture. Also, I add a pinch of smoked paprika to suit my Portuguese husband’s palate.”This dish is woven with personal memories. Roz tells how she grew up in the Middle East and had mainly American friends, so Heinz was a familiar brand and is reminiscent of that time. For Zoe, baked beans, and this recipe, are memories of childhood and comfort: “A rainy Sunday afternoon? Soup time. Off school sick? Definitely time to bring out the big guns of Mum’s minestrone. The smell of it cooking is beyond delicious, filling the house.“When discussing this recipe with Mum,” Zoe says, “she revealed its greatest quality – using what you have.” Utilising leftovers was a key part of the family home when growing up, and an ethos Zoe has continued. This recipe is easy to adapt and uses many basic store cupboard standards – especially the beans. And, after the extravagance of Christmas, this recipe offers a nourishing and healthier alternative thanks to the no added sugar beans.A store cupboard classic this is a British take on the famed Italian recipe.

This is a dish that has developed from family tradition and his rich cultural heritage. Rehncy speaks about how his love of cooking started young: “My parents are Indian but born in east Africa. Growing up in Tanzania I would spend time at my dad’s Indian restaurant with the chefs in the kitchen.”This has stood him in good stead – on a lads’ getaway he cooked this dish for 20 friends as the only one able to cook, he was responsible for making sure they were fed for the trip.Rehncy’s mother died when he was young and all hands were on deck in the house a memory he has is his father’s Saturday tradition of a fry-up, with baked beans being a staple. One Saturday his father added a twist – onions, spices and chillies – the beginnings of this recipe. Thadka loosely means to add spice. “When you create any Indian dish you need a base to start. Our base is the beans, and any spices added are the thadka,” says Rehncy. “I chose these spices because they’re simple, easy and most importantly, are in every Indian household – classics.”He says the masala beans go well with toast, eggs, or, as his wife loves them, straight out of the bowl!Rehncy adds that the no added sugar variant is great because most of the adults in his family are diabetic and this allows them to eat baked beans more often than not.Ingredients (per 2x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz)2 tbsp rapeseed oil1 white onion (finely diced)4 cloves garlic (finely chopped)4cm piece of ginger (grated or finely chopped)2 green chilli (finely chopped)1 tsp turmeric1 tsp cumin powder1 tsp mustard seeds1 tsp coriander powder1 tsp garam masala powderSmall bunch of fresh corianderMethodAdd the oil to a saucepan on a medium heat (enough for the tin of Heinz beans) with the oil and the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds begin to pop (you’ll hear little popping sounds), add the onion.Once the onion has started to soften, add in the ginger, garlic and chilli, cook down until the onion starts to brown slightly.Add in the cumin seeds and gently cook for another 2 minutes.Add the spices – turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder and garam masala. Cook these down on a medium to low heat for a couple of minutes just to take the harshness out. Once you see the oil separating from the “masala mix” you can now add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz.Fold in the beans with the mixture until it is thoroughly mixed through and coated.

Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

My mum used to bake bread. I can still remember waking up to the smell of her amazing little crusty rolls. We’d have them with crispy bacon, eggs and baked beans and that was just a little plate of joy to start the day. I can still taste it when I think about it.Mum’s from Antigua and beans are also a big part of Caribbean cooking. Rice and peas, which is really rice and beans, is one of my favourite things. It’s so comforting, it’s like the Caribbean version of mashed potatoes. Then you put curried goat or chicken or fried fish on it – or just more beans. If you’re tired or lonely, sad or happy – whatever it is – rice and peas will generally sort it out.These days I’ve become more aware of sugar in dishes. A honey glaze here, something else there and, before you know it, you’ve pushed the sugar levels way up. For me it’s all about balance now. And low-sugar products are great for that.You can also bring out sweetness using existing foods on your plate, for example when you’re cooking your onions or leeks, let them go for longer because they create their own sweetness as they caramelise. It takes a while to adjust to that different kind of sweetness but it really works. Or add some cumin and a little salt to carrots and roast them to enhance their sweetness.It’s no surprise to me that beans are such a mainstay of so many cultures. Brazil has feijoada – black beans and pork stew. Families come together and add farofa, a toasted cornmeal, to it. And think of pasta e fagioli in Italy. There’s a familiar heartiness that beans evoke for me and historically they’re a food that people without much money could afford.We see them as humble but forget how versatile they are. They’re a brilliant carrier of flavour and add real depth and ballast to a plate. They’re a kind of security food. When I became a mother, I’d send my kids to school on beans on toast because I knew it was going to last and fill them the right way. My daughter Miquita was also a big fan of my cheesy baked beans. It was a kind of Welsh rarebit with a bit of Worcester sauce, all bubbling under the grill with silky beans and crusty bread underneath.The most exciting thing in cooking is when you take something people think of as humble and transform it into something really delicious and surprising. People forget the ways they can use the tin of beans in the cupboard – they’re haricots in tomato sauce, which is the basis of so many dishes. That’s why I came up with this recipe, which combines pork and beans – an age-old combination. Watch any cowboy film and that’s what they’re eating.In this dish, I use tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz to pair with the pork the creaminess of the beans and the salty, spiciness of the pork just makes me really happy. Then you get amazing sweetness from the leek and garlic running through it all.A hearty recipe that’s bound to satisfy – if you’re making it for kids you can go easy on the chilli.

Take the pork belly, slip it into an ovenproof dish, rub in all the spices, then pour in the stock. Cover with tinfoil, and place in the oven for at least 90 minutes, and up to 120 minutes – the meat needs to be very tender so that when you test with a skewer or small knife it is soft. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a board or rack to cool it down. Reserve the cooking juices left in the pan as well. Take the meat and pull it apart or roughly chop it up. As with the juices, leave to one side.Take a good heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter, add the oil, then all of the other ingredients except the beans. Soften the ingredients very gently over a low heat for about 40 minutes, until they are very soft and caramelised. Add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, pour in the cooking juices from the pork belly.

Crisp and crunchy fish and chips, juicy burgers on the barbecue and decadent chocolate brownies are simply too much of a temptation, no matter that you’ve promised to be good this week. But you don’t have to choose between health and hankering after a little indulgence: we’ve rewritten the cookbook to give five comfort foods a healthier summer makeover.Using simple swaps we’ve reduced the salt, sugar and fat content of some of our favourite family meals, as well as increasing the vitamin and mineral content with a few extra portions of veg. What’s more – there’s no compromise on flavour.Here’s how to have your cake and eat it (and your chips, and your fry-up …).Healthier burger and chips Adding grated carrot or courgette to your favourite burger recipe is a savvy way to cut the fat content and increase your daily veg intake – and it keeps burgers moist on the barbecue too.Grate the vegetables finely, squeeze out as much liquid as you can, and stir in to lean mince, adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce and an egg to hold it all together. Cook the burgers on the barbecue, a griddle or in a frying pan, depending on the weather, and pile them up with plenty of tomatoes, crunchy lettuce and pickles.For healthier chips, cut large potatoes into thick fingers, boil them for four minutes and then roast in a hot oven with a drizzle of olive oil for 30 minutes or until golden. Less grease, less guilt – and lots of grinning faces around the table.Start by roasting sausages with sliced red onion, small cubes of sweet potato and a drizzle of oil in a hot oven. After about 20 minutes, or when the potatoes soften and the sausages are almost cooked through, add baby tomatoes on the vine, a handful of sliced flat-cap mushrooms and a few thyme sprigs, and bake for another 10 minutes. Make eight small gaps in the tray crack eggs into four of the holes and spoon Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz into the others, then bake for four minutes until the egg whites are set and the beans are warmed through. Serve with toast and a pot of tea.Feelgood fish and chipsReplace your normal fish-batter recipe with this healthier egg-based version – it’s salt free and cooks well in the oven. Not only are you increasing the protein content of this family favourite but by avoiding the deep-fat fryer you’ll cut down the fat content considerably.Whisk one egg white until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the broken yolk, adding lemon zest and finely chopped parsley. Dip two cod fillets into the egg-white batter and bake at 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6 for 15 minutes until the batter is crisp and the fish is cooked through. Serve with healthier oven-cooked chips, see recipe above, and minty crushed peas or with a big green salad.Guilt-free chocolate browniesIt’s a universal fact that the ultimate chocolate brownie should be dense and fudgy on the inside, with a slightly crisp top for complete satisfaction. The big secret is that this can be achieved without a lot of butter and sugar!Tinned black beans or sweet potato work wonderfully in chocolate brownies, as they have a natural sweetness and a fudgy texture that stands up to the dark chocolate. For black bean brownies, replace the butter with a tin of beans and a little oil. And replace the sugar with maple syrup. For the sweet potato option, use two large sweet potatoes cooked and mashed and 14 dates to replace the butter and sugar respectively.A more unusual substitution is mayonnaise. Swap out butter for your favourite low cal mayo and you’ll get the same rich, gooey brownie but with less fat and fewer calories.Alternative beans on toastYes, beans on toast covered in melted cheese can solve most of your problems, but there are healthier ways to get the same hit. This baked-bean quesadilla is a fun, Mexican twist on a teatime treat and has all the beany-cheesy goodness but less sugar, salt and fat. Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz count as one of your five a day, and they’re naturally low in fat, with no added sugars, artificial colours, flavours or preservatives, which makes them a healthier alternative for all the family.Heat up a portion of the beans and then microwave two wholewheat flour tortillas for 15 seconds, or until warm. Spoon the hot beans over one tortilla using a slotted spoon so you don’t get too much sauce (no one wants soggy tortillas), and mash the beans lightly with a fork. Sprinkle with low-fat feta cheese, fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime, then put the other tortilla on top. Cut into four and serve with a big green salad, and a slightly smug feeling on the side.While you might not be able to stop the cravings, you can transform your food with a few healthy swaps – like using Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, sneaking in some extra vegetables, or getting creative with your cooking.Find out more about Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/495f8014ea7897bff6f42d836dacaed9e9148bb9/0_87_3744_2245/master/3744.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e97707504bced416f62f9e4a266b92ab","title":"and heres the kitchen garden cooped up britain moves the indoors outdoors","story":"As lockdown forces us to use every inch inside our homes, those lucky enough to have outside space are going al-frescoA bench and a slightly wobbly table used to be adequate for sitting and eating outside on warm days. Now the vogue is to turn your garden into a sophisticated outdoor living room, with rugs, cushions, scented candles and fire pits. “Outdoor living rooms are not a new idea, but it’s definitely a huge thing for 2020,” said Ann-Marie Powell, a garden designer. “People are desperate to utilise whatever space they have at the moment, from a big garden to a tiny urban balcony, to help them stay sane in lockdown.”For the first time since 1913, apart from during the two world wars, the show will not take place in the grounds of the Royal Hospital this year. Instead, its website will host experts and designers showing off their own gardens, offering advice and demonstrations, and answering questions from the public.Nikki Tibbles of florists Wild At Heart started working on her first garden for this year’s show more than a year ago. “Everything is ready to go, all the plants are perfect.

Our West Highland terrier, Ziggy, who had travelled the world with us, was rapidly declining.She’d beaten the odds three times following the discovery of a mass on her bladder which was finally confirmed as cancer. But in the space of a few months she’d gone from accompanying us on 10km runs to struggling to walk, unable to pee and poo easily, her quality of life rapidly declining.We’d decided we wanted to be with her when she was euthanised – the kindest thing to do, our vet told us – but by that time in March that service was in short supply.The best option we could find was for the procedure to be performed in a quiet part of a vet’s car park in Epping Forest. It felt grim to contemplate. But in the end it was painfully moving, her last moments spent curled up between us as we sat on the ground, her chin resting in my lap.It is perhaps why, last week, the television gardener Monty Don’s response to the loss of his own dog Nigel triggered a jolt of recognition. “What he had,” said Don, “was this absolute sense of purity. He exuded an unsullied innocence. We all love our dogs but I’ve had lots of dogs and he was special it’s very hard to put your finger on it.”Amid the sadness, these days there is also a feeling of guilt. A sense somehow that – real as it is – it is wrong to be feeling grief for a dog at a time when so many others are losing friends and family.The dog thing came late for me. I just about remember our childhood English bull terrier, Fanny, a stage dog my father adopted while he was working in the theatre after she was fired for biting members of the cast of Oliver!Ziggy, though, arrived in my late 40s, and became a firm fixture in our lives, accompanying us everywhere, including on a four-year stint as the  and Observer’s correspondent in Jerusalem.Now, he was gone. And suddenly we were without a dog.Scientists and psychologists are still edging towards understanding the strange and millennia-old relationship between dogs and humans. On the animals’ side of things, the picture is reasonably clear: the grey wolf, from which all breeds of domesticated dogs descended, already had a highly evolved, sophisticated and social brain. And, as dogs became domesticated, that brain appears to have acquired a sensitivity towards the human gaze and body language that allowed for training. But, beyond the developing utilitarian function of dogs, the human draw to make canines their pets has prompted competing explanations.As Marta Borgi and Francesca Cirulli of the department of behavioural neuroscience at the Istituto Superiore di Sanità in Rome suggested in a paper in Frontiers in Psychology: “Why animals constitute such an attractive stimulus for humans has not been completely clarified.“Living beings engage the attention of people more than objects do, and it has been hypothesised that the evolutionary reason behind this response is that paying attention to other living beings is significant for inidual fitness.”Other theories have been posited. One suggests that we feel a greater attraction to species that are closer to us on the genetic family tree or that are similar in behavioural or cognitive ways.Then there is the long-established notion of Kindchenschema or “baby schema”, which suggests humans are attracted specifically to animals that display “cute” or infantile features with a large head and obvious eyes, although recent MRI studies of brain activation patterns in women viewing facial images of their own child and own dog suggested different responses.And while many of those specialising in the field have sought to avoid the use of the word “friendship” in response to animal-human relationships, Borgi and Cirulli embrace it.“In our opinion ‘friendship’ appears to be the most suitable word to describe close human-pet relationships, which imply the formation of a social bond that serves analogous emotional and adaptive functions as human-human friendships,” they write.“Most of the properties that a relationship should have in order to be characterised as friendship are traceable in the human-pet association: intimacy, companionship, trust, loyalty, commitment, affection, acceptance, sympathy, concern for the other’s welfare, as well as time spent together and maintenance of the pair bond after long separations.”Perhaps, as the Pulitzer-winning poet Mary Oliver wrote in Dog Talk, the end piece essay for the collection Dog Songs, some of the attachment relates to the way in which canines occupy a middle space between the wild and the tame worlds, interpreting that other place for us.“Some things are unchangeably wild, others stolidly tame … There are wild things that have been altered, but only into a semblance of tameness, it is no real change. But the dog lives in both worlds.”But it is Don’s comment about “unsullied innocence” that resonates the most with me. After Ziggy’s death a friend suggested that what we see in our dogs are “hairy little saints”. And in a time of such uncertainty, our social bonds disrupted, it is perhaps this that people are seeking.Last week a new dog arrived in our lives. Mindful of the “hairy saint” description we’ve called him Bodhi, meaning “awakened,” although into what dog world we’ll never know. It is always an emotional contract, entered into, as Oliver puts it, in the knowledge of our dogs’ brief time on earth.“It is exceedingly short, his galloping life. Dogs die so soon … We would do anything to keep them with us, and to keep them young. The one gift we cannot give.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c811bcbecc7bcb272b0ecf0c2c7a2e17b4716008/0_0_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c40da73aad4f270c846ebf3487edeb9","title":"one of us did have a little cry what this years chelsea stars did instead","story":"The show gardens at Chelsea take a year to plan, so what do you do when the highlight of the horticultural calendar is cancelled? Five designers talk plan BsDesigned by Charlotte Harris and Hugo Bugg The Chelsea pressure starts mounting after Christmas. It was on 13 March, when the London Marathon was postponed, that we thought, OK, it probably isn’t going to happen. When we got the email, we were at the nursery, Crocus, setting out our trees. It was the right decision, but one of us did have a little cry.Our garden was a small public space, like a pocket park: a place of respite for people and wildlife. The planting was robust, suitable for the urban environment and climate change. It included sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) for structure, bursts of colour from a black gum tree (Nyssa sylvatica) and the fragrant flowers and red edible berries of the autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata). We used a lot of reclaimed materials, including a large sculpture designed by Andrew Mcmullan, made from reconditioned pipework to evoke the garden’s imagined industrial past.The plan is for the garden to make an appearance at Chelsea in 2021. It was always our commitment for it to have a permanent home after the show, and that will still happen next year, so we’ll be holding on to all the plants and trees. The garden feels even more resonant now green space is vital for the mental wellbeing of people who don’t have gardens.We are still busy: we’re working on the interior of five new glasshouses at Gothenburg Botanical Garden and gardens for a social justice charity. And because we are working from home (Charlotte in London Hugo in Devon) we do have more time to be in our own gardens. We’ve been encouraging our studio colleagues to take a couple of hours off at lunchtime, to do some gardening or go for a walk so they get a break.A Celebration of Modern-Day Nursing, designed by Robert Myers This garden would have marked the 200th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. The strapline is “nurture through nature”: highlighting Nightingale’s emphasis on the importance of daylight and cleanliness, open space, garden views and the therapeutic benefit of plants.The design is for a courtyard garden surrounded by a shady cloister, with floor-to-ceiling windows: the idea is that visitors would view the garden as if looking through a hospital window. The garden was going to be filled with the sort of medicinal plants Nightingale might have used, such as foxglove, which was used for heart problems, along with plants from the pressed flower collection she made as a young girl. The planting plan includes the straw foxglove, Digitalis lutea, and a cultivar of the common foxglove, D. purpurea ‘Dalmatian Peach’. I also included Chinese rhubarb, Rheum palmatum ‘Tanguticum’, as Nightingale always carried powdered rhubarb in her nursing bag. We hope the garden (which is sponsored by the Burdett Trust for Nursing) will appear at Chelsea next year.I work from an old barn complex in Worcestershire: there’s a little courtyard that has been sitting unplanted for the past year since we moved in some of the plants that the nursery Hortus Loci grew for the show garden have been rehomed there. My favourite is the fernleaf peony, which was among Nightingale’s pressed flower collection coincidentally, it grows wild in the mountains of Crimea and Turkey, where she nursed during the Crimean war. Designed by Peter Chmiel and Chin-Jung Chen This was to be our first Chelsea. Our garden was inspired by a study tour of Guangzhou, known as China’s flower city. We were impressed by its environmental city planning: it has provided a green lung, water gardens and social spaces for residents so they can get close to nature. We are in a climate and bioersity emergency and wanted our garden (which is sponsored by the Administration of Forestry and Gardening of Guangzhou Municipality) to highlight how cities can meet those challenges.A show garden is a different scale for us – we are used to designing larger schemes, with an eye on maturation in 10 years or longer, so to do something that had to look immaculate and mature on day one was a great experience.When the difficult, but correct, decision was made, the wind was taken out of our sails but, fingers crossed, we can get it built next year. The garden was to feature more than 3,500 herbaceous perennials, marginal and aquatic plants. We’ll try to keep some, but some will have to be regrown. We both live in Somerset working from home is challenging, but we’re managing well. We have set ourselves a few tasks, such as growing tarragon to make the ultimate chicken sandwich – anything to lift the spirits.

The industry responded quickly, first by putting archive shows online (many of them available free of charge) and then by creating specially commissioned works, online festivals, and other ingenious ways to keep audiences connected to venues.Seven weeks on, there is a blizzard of theatre being streamed online. The new work is mainly in the form of monologues, filmed by the actor in some cases. These were initially quick-response dramas, rough around the edges, but have grown far slicker. Some companies are using technology in inventive ways too, such as interactive theatre on Zoom.I have spoken to writers, actors and artistic directors who are thinking hard about ways to adapt but there is grave concern about funding and future survival, and sometimes I have felt a lump in my throat after an interview. But a lot of them have pointed out that this is an imaginative art form so will find ways to survive. I think it is true, though live theatre might look and feel different when it is back.Reviewing theatre from my sofa rather than the stalls is not the same thing. Being in the room gives you an intensity of focus and it demands continuous attention. At home I can press pause or rewind, and that changes everything.I don’t feel the nervous thrill of an overnight deadline either because I am now often watching a show in the daytime, and have far longer to write.

Closing cinemas and video stores would have meant no new films coming out, and releasing them straight to DVD would involve mail order, an unreliable and unappetising option. Reviews on that basis would have been all but impossible.But streaming technology – which took off around 2006 – has changed that. Now the industry has found that people in lockdown have a huge appetite for new films on streaming services, and critics can watch the films themselves a week or so in advance on their laptops. So although some big-ticket items like James Bond have been delayed and international film festivals this year pretty much cancelled, film critics carry doggedly on, watching films on their laptops. Actually, they were doing that with one or two films a week anyway. I’m only being semi-facetious when I say that a Thursday night clapping session should be devoted to the people who keep Britain’s wifi going.What the lockdown has meant is that the film critic’s life has become lonelier, more isolated— although also, arguably, more thoughtful. We used to see movies on the big screen, often with loads of other people. Film watching was a part of professional life and also part of a bustlingly social real life. In many ways, it’s a triumph that cinema has carried on. But the real danger is that commercial success for streamed movies will mean that studios will be less interested in cinema releases after the lockdown, and that home-streaming will become, if not the new normal, then increasingly the new more-possible. But film critics will be very glad to get out of their lockdown — and back inside the darkness of a cinema.On one level, lockdown hasn’t changed my working life too dramatically: I’ve spent 20 years working from home. But on the other, there are no gigs to review, and fewer albums: opinion seems ided as to whether it’s better to press on with releases as planned or put release dates back in the hope things will have returned to something like normality by the time the album comes out. There are no face-to-face interviews, and I hate using Zoom or FaceTime. Conversation always seems incredibly stilted on them, as if people haven’t quite learned yet how to behave naturally. Or maybe they’re just horrified by my appearance after eight weeks without a visit to the barbers, which is fair enough.And depressingly, the shortfall in interviews and reviews has been more than made up for by a surge in obituaries and posthumous appreciations.I have no idea what the future holds for the music industry, and frankly nor does anyone else: everything you hear or read on the subject is just conjecture, no matter how authoritative its tone seems. I don’t see an industry predicated on mass gatherings getting to back to normal in a hurry. There’s a theory that festivals and major tours aren’t going to restart in earnest until 2022. What happens in the interim is anyone’s guess: I’ve heard predictions of everything from financial apocalypse to an explosion of creativity unbridled by the usual rules which no longer apply. But no one knows. That’s one of the hardest things about life at the moment: the not knowing.I started self-isolating about two weeks before lockdown. It wasn’t a vast change to my normal lifestyle and it made me feel better not to have to think of myself as a potential mass murderer every time I went out. But when lockdown was announced, even though my physical state didn’t change, my emotional state took a similar knock to everyone else’s. And having the pestilence “officially” confirmed – well, no matter how happily introverted in ordinary times, no matter how much dystopian fiction you have read (or viewed), it turns out that it’s still a bit of a facer when it comes.I can work under almost any circumstances because it has always been my salvation and because I’m lucky enough to love what I do. I’ve filed columns hours after being sacked, after finding out a friend had died, and throughout a fairly hefty bout of post-natal depression. And I found I could still, just about. TV reviews were still doable, but as time has gone on they have had to be written during ever-smaller gaps, between homeschooling, meal-assembly three times a day, crying with rage after government briefings, fatigue after anxiety-dream-ridden nights, and fear for my parents. My dad, and so effectively my mother too, have been shielding from the beginning and a few weeks ago he was diagnosed with early stomach cancer as well, which is extremely thoughtless of him. I hope my writing’s quality (whatever it was to begin with) hasn’t dropped – if it has then I can only apologise and promise that I’m doing my best. It’s all, unless we’re purporting to lead the country, any of us can do.The truest piece of criticism I’ve read since lockdown was by Jay Rayner. He wrote about the joy of eating sausages from the fridge as an example of the comforts we should allow ourselves in these challenging times.I wish I could write about art like that – as something simple and reassuring in which we can all find solace. Art isn’t always like that. It can be sophisticated, controversial, difficult - the opposite of a hearty banger.But it can also touch the deepest wellsprings of fear and hope. I’m trying as a critic to draw attention to such art, in these times that remind us how mortal we are. In a forthcoming project for  Documentaries we explore the tragic art of Rembrandt and Rothko, the ecstatic sunrises of Monet and Turner, finding resources of inspiration as well as portrayals of pain.I think the best thing a critic can do now is point to art that strengthens. It’s impressive how many artists are producing such images. Tracey Emin made a video diary with her usual direct honesty. Gilbert and George shared a very different insight into their besuited lockdown. And David Hockney is doing his best work in years, depicting spring in his French garden in colours of joy. Art can be as good as a sausage after all.Back-to-back building tours, hasty previews of unfinished exhibitions, the frantic dash around the opening days of the Venice Biennale – with all of that wiped off the calendar, the pandemic has provided a useful time to pause and slow down.Visiting new buildings may be off limits for the foreseeable future, but that means we can train our sights on the unbuilt – such as the alarming proposals for Gateshead Quays, which otherwise might have slipped under the radar. The last few weeks have also allowed space to zoom out and look more deeply at some broader topics, whether that’s the murky mechanics of the housebuilding industry, or the startling career of the unsung Irish designer Eileen Gray.The pandemic has spawned its own plethora of material too, from designers coming up with Covid-fighting solutions , to the host of temporary structures popping up across the world , to wider questions about how our cities might adapt if the virus is here to stay. Ultimately, the lockdown has had a clarifying effect, exposing our stark urban inequalities and making clear the urgent need to improve housing space standards and prioritise streets for walking and cycling. As critics, we must fight to ensure that these lessons are heeded, and we don’t just go back to business as usual when it’s all over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62a693384f03e47f73dbd502361dcd9036d5c084/128_302_1664_999/master/1664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ddbf5667be582e4c666bb569fc32f29","title":"meet the youtuber who made lockdown work for her","story":"Jessica Kellgren-Fozard earns a good living online – here is her advice for aspiring vloggersLike millions of Britons, Jessica Kellgren-Fozard is at home. Unlike other workers, however, the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on her day job has been minimal. That’s because her home in Brighton with her wife and two dogs was already her office and her career is making YouTube vlogs for her 686,000 subscribers.The deaf influencer, who posts upbeat videos about disability, LGBTQ+ issues, vintage fashion and other subjects, started her channel three-and-a-half years ago after she left a job as a presenter for a local TV station. Because she suffers from nerve disorder HNPP (hereditary neuropathy with pressure palsies), which results in extreme palsy in her arms and weak limbs, as well as a rare autoimmune disease called MCTD (mixed connective tissue disease), she was often unable to meet the demands of the job, and there were days when she couldn’t leave her bed.“I really needed a more flexible way of working,” the 31-year-old says. “Trying to fit around someone else’s schedule was driving me into the ground and making me really unwell. So when I got married, my lovely wife said: ‘Why don’t you give YouTube a go? For six months I will financially support you – just have a go.’”Success wasn’t instant. Like all YouTubers, she had to apply to the site’s partner programme to make money from adverts running on her videos. To achieve partner status, your channel needs 1,000 subscribers, and for people to have watched 4,000 hours’ worth of your videos a month. Kellgren-Fozard says she earned just £200 a month at the beginning. It wasn’t until one of her videos went viral and her subscribers swelled to more than 200,000 that she saw her business take off. Now she’s earning a five-figure salary and is the main breadwinner of the family.As well as ad revenue, she makes money from partnering with brands to promote their products or services in her videos, and from members who pay a fee for access to exclusive content and privileges.If you are at home now, watching viral cat videos or PE with Joe Wicks, and think you could do better, then join the two-metre spaced queue. As the number of people working from home and self-isolating increased, so did the number of people considering vlogging for the first time.Research conducted by SEO agency Blueclaw claims that even filming mundane activities has the potential to make money. It looked at the most searched-for videos on YouTube and calculated how much the creator whose channel has been monetised stood to make.For example, a video of someone shopping online could make them £1,523 if it is watched 1,160,988 times. Needless to say, that’s a lot of viewers, and some videos on YouTube struggle to get even hundreds of views.Jennifer Quigley-Jones, founder of YouTube influencer agency Digital Voices, says it is about finding a new twist on a popular topic, for example, beauty looks inspired by specific music videos or films. Or food challenges, such as feeding a family for £5. With home schooling now widespread, explainer videos in education are also flying at the moment, she adds.But while Kellgren-Fozard says the startup costs are minimal – initial videos can be shot on a laptop or smartphone camera and edited on free apps such as Apple’s iMovie – launching a successful channel requires a big time commitment. To launch her usual two videos a week, she works 60 hours coming up with new ideas, filming, editing and managing her social media.The most important consideration, she says, is choosing the right content for your videos.“For some it is working out what niche works best, whether you really enjoy making videos that are incredibly fast-paced and funny and chunkily cut together, messy and fun, or whether you want to make the long-form, slower pieces which people will have on when maybe doing the dishes or chopping food ready for dinner,” she says.As Kellgren-Fozard found, getting enough subscribers to make your videos profitable is the real challenge. People subscribe usually once they trust your channel. If you are lucky enough to have a video go viral, that’s great, but unless you can convince people that you are more than just a one-trick pony and give them a reason to come back, you are not going to grow.The key, Quigley-Jones says, is building up a bank of videos that shows what you specialise in, what type of content you consistently create and what your channel is about. Consistency is also vital – launch the same number of videos at the same time each week. Making longer videos, naming them in intriguing ways and tapping into trending topics as much as possible can also get your channel noticed in a sea of vlogs.One of the biggest things that stops people starting their own YouTube channel is the idea that they have to be perfect, she adds.“We are all perfectionists and deeply self-critical and anxious, but YouTube is not like TV. It’s not embarrassing to make mistakes,” she says. “So try to stop your perfectionist side. A lot of people stop themselves making videos because of that fear, especially women who are quite disheartened by criticism and nervous about how they might be perceived. So try to silence your inner critic and get something out there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/605c280d236579c40ea7cac0dd3b73d93bc655a1/0_95_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=076e81ec6dff026efcf6477edf14bc03","title":"charli xcx how im feeling now review show and tell turned up to 11","story":"The ‘workaholic party animal’ has, under the glare of social media, put together the ultimate lockdown albumA level of mystique has long surrounded how musicians bottle their magic. In 2015, PJ Harvey – a fiercely private British artist – exposed the recording of her Hope Six Demolition Project to public view at London’s Somerset House, workshopping the songs behind one-way glass.Fast-forward five years, and Charli XCX – fiercely public British artist Charlotte Aitchison – has released an album written, recorded, produced and art-directed in the space of a few weeks, with unprecedented levels of real-time scrutiny via social media. The only pre-Covid song here is party4u, a previously unreleased fan favourite.Not only has How I’m Feeling Now been created at warp speed and under lockdown restrictions – handily the Hertfordshire-raised singer lives lives in Los Angeles with her two managers and her boyfriend, Huck Kwong, who is good with a camera – but the 27-year-old Aitchison has turned the notion of creative show-and-tell up to 11. She has effectively taken ownership of “the lockdown album” (see the release schedule for the next 24 months).Fan interaction is nothing new. Most stars keep fans engaged through social media, typically teasing snippets of unreleased music. Memes abound.Aitchison has gone further, establishing an email address for would-be producers to send beats to, airing lyrics-in-progress and screenshots of texts with collaborators. She’s hosted Zoom meetings with fans, posted updates from her bathroom, focus-grouped her output via her socials. On 21 April, Aitchison reported she had cried because she was putting too much pressure on her collaborators. Last Monday, a clip on her Instagram feed demonstrated how she was stitching together vocals (“comping”) for another tune, 7 Years.If the process has been dizzying to witness – how Aitchison continues to sustain her Apple Music Beats 1 show, interviews, and the personal upkeep of several social feeds alongside music-making is a mystery – the results have been highly effective.Claws – a hyper-digital earworm – came out a fortnight ago, its title chosen by fans. The playful video was shot on a home green screen (de rigueur among YouTubers). It’s a tune Aitchison might have done anyway with producer Dylan Brady (of 100 Gecs), but more DIY. Surprisingly, given that Aitchison’s posturing tunes often mirror her hard-partying lifestyle, Claws is a love song. “I love, I love, I love everything about you,” she sings.Having clocked up a number of conventional hits a few years ago, Aitchison now specialises in acrylic, outre, influencer club-pop, abetted by producer AG Cook (in Montana with “bad wifi”, but co-exec producer nonetheless). Her celebrated 2019 album, Charli, took some confident strides back towards the mainstream with blowsy tracks like White Mercedes and guests like Haim and Christine and the Queens. Before lockdown, Aitchison told an interviewer that she’d been working on music that felt “very polished, very structured”.How I’m Feeling Now is light on guests (purposely so) and polish. It returns to the gleeful disruption of her more ear-bleeding work, while piling on sing-song tunes. And if the interactivity of this record is, perhaps, limited to fans passing judgment on artwork, the overriding impression is that How I’m Feeling Now is truly a work of its time – not just the Covid era, with its own Dogme-like parameters – but the always-on feedback loop of output and comments that goes with creative culture now.Aitchison’s work is explicitly not for everyone it aggressively foregrounds its own artifice. A song like Detonate calls on arpeggiating synths, 8-bit video game sounds and the bleeping of a detonator. In this corner of club-pop, which takes cues from trap and K-pop, skull-drilling repetition is a feature, not a bug.Aitchison has never specialised in over-intellectualisation, preferring bangers that live in the giddy moment. Pink Diamond (“I just wanna go real hard”) is all icy drama. Anthems, too, boasts OTT rave stabs (and the faintest impression of Basement Jaxx). It’s a paean to partying, with added self-knowledge. In all this lairiness you find occasional admissions that Aitchison is trying to fill some void. Another song, C2.0, is an ode to how she is missing “her clique” of all these tracks, it sounds the most thrown-together.If these songs are more off the cuff than before, nothing here sounds unprofessional. Some lyrics have not exactly been sweated-over – “I love you forever, even when we’re not together,” goes Forever – but they chime with people feeling acutely separated from loved ones.The song is, of course, another heart emoji to Kwong. It’s not the last. “You love me even when I hate myself, I’m sure,” intones an Auto-Tuned Aitchison on I Finally Understand, whose excellent bouncy beat comes from producer Palmistry 7 Years is a hydraulic ballad that s Aitchsion and Kwong’s long onoff affair.In a Zane Lowe interview, Aitchison remarked that her and Kwong’s relationship had been physically and emotionally distant prior to lockdown. Quarantine had brought them closer. “How do you express that you’re in love with someone 10 different times on an album without just sounding sycophantic?” she joked. If the title flags its own diaristic intentions, How I’m Feeling Now reflects this workaholic party animal’s gratitude for love.How I’m Feeling Now is out now via AtlanticAsylum.

Next up: an album she wrote with fans while on lockdown in LANineteen years post-Pop Idol, there is not much left to demystify about the way pop music is made. Fans follow the industry’s movements as obsessively as football supporters do the Premier League songwriters and producers have their own followings. There are podcasts where artists explain a song’s path from genesis to completion. And yet, watching Charli XCX handwrite lyrics live on Instagram over the past few weeks, straight from her brain to her notebook to thousands of viewers, felt like a borderline masochistic degree of exposure – the equivalent of me livestreaming my way through every sentence of this piece. I’d rather walk down the street naked.On 6 April, XCX – 27-year-old Cambridge-born Charlotte Aitchison – announced she was making an entire album, How I’m Feeling Now, while in lockdown at home in Los Angeles. She would share every step: lyric-writing and video-shooting progress-stalling allergic reactions tearful late-night Instagram confessions that she thinks she expects too much of her collaborators (later deleted). Fans were given carte blanche to give feedback and contribute visuals. “Sometimes it’s nerve-racking,” she says, when I ask if this amount of openness makes her feel vulnerable. “Other times bad comments will sway me, but I need to roll with the punches. If people don’t like it, it’s OK. The idea is to have some kind of interesting tension, to make the music feel different, and representative of the time that we’re in.”It takes confidence to field so much input but, over a decade, Aitchison has built a career around her extreme multifacetedness. A pop auteur known for her abrasive bubblegum futurism, she has also scored mainstream hits featuring Lizzo and Rita Ora (Blame It on Your Love, Doing It), and written others for the likes of Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello (she co-wrote their monster hit Señorita). In 2018, she supported Taylor Swift on tour, commanding stadium singalongs to Boom Clap, an atypically swoony love song she wrote for the teen weepie The Fault In Our Stars.Meanwhile, on nights off, Aitchison did solo shows at sweaty gay clubs, unleashing hedonistic ragers about pills and parties as she ricocheted around the stage like Keith Flint, all electric muscularity in Lycra and tulle. At times her career has looked like performance art about pop stardom, though she would reject that as overintellectualising. But it can get confusing: during a brief stint at the Slade School of Fine Art, she flummoxed her tutors by dancing to Justin Bieber while stuffing hamburgers down her pants.As she writes How I’m Feeling Now, Aitchison is hosting open weekly Zoom conferences in which she asks famous friends (Game Of Thrones’ Maisie Williams, Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova) how they’re coping and answers fans’ questions. She finishes one just before our interview, wrapping up with a thank you from an ebullient sex performer named Sophie, and takes five minutes to fetch a jumper before reappearing in her office. This morning she worked until 3.30am, before starting the conference at 9.30am. She looks tired, rubbing her eyes and glancing at her phone: her brain is “split in two”, she apologises. She had planned on pulling an all-nighter. “I had a bit of a freakout yesterday. I’ve only mixed two songs and it comes out in two weeks. I really have to go for it.” She has six more ideas, and plans to release a 10-track album. She could extend the deadline? “It’s not even an option – my inner guilt would spiral out of control. I just have to make it on time.”Partying has been Aitchison’s biggest source of inspiration no one is better at crystallising the invincible highs or lonely lows of a night out. Now the dancefloors are dimmed, she has only the inside of her four mock-Tudor walls to play with. The entire household is hostage to the album: she lives with her two best friends from school, who are also her managers, and Huck Kwong, a video game producer and her on-off boyfriend of seven years. “It’s a cult kind of vibe,” she admits. The lounge has become a recording studio. The artwork for her single Forever was photographed in her bedroom. She exercises and directs her own photoshoots (like this one) in the space outside. Lockdown is the longest she and Kwong have spent together, she says, and it’s been good to write about it. It’s also been weird, “yelling about my relationship into a microphone while my boyfriend’s in the other room, doing a puzzle”.When it comes to collaborating with fans, Aitchison says she has been surprised by the way they have gravitated towards the deeper stuff – not the parties and fast cars. “I suppose I was always afraid to show that side of myself,” she says. But sharing everything has its downsides: one day, she posted lyrics on Twitter and fans thought they were so bad, they were a joke. “Then I posted funny, fake lyrics to troll myself and they were like, ‘This is sick!’ I thought, ‘Oh no!’” (She didn’t use them.)A few weeks before lockdown, Aitchison had started therapy to unpick the roots of her workaholism: How I’m Feeling Now is her sixth full-length album in seven years. She had been enjoying “slowing down, and being still and present at home. But the fact that I decided to do the album shows I couldn’t continue like that. I’m always forward, forward, forward,” she says, with the intensity of a general directing troops.Of course, nobody becomes a pop star to slack off these days it’s more important than ever to maintain a constant presence on Spotify playlists and social media. Still, the 1975 frontman Matt Healy – whose recordings with Aitchison have yet to see the light of day – tells me she is on another level. “She just wants to work all the time. I’m bad, but she’s worse.” Collaborating with her is like “taking psychedelics”, he says: there are “rushes of madness and excitement, but you are left feeling rewarded, thankful and reflective. Although still drained.”Aitchison thinks she inherited the guilt that comes with any downtime from her parents: her Scottish father was adopted into a working-class family her mother is a Ugandan Indian whose family was expelled by Idi Amin in the 1970s. They met at his club night: Jon was a promoter, Shameera was a nurse and later a flight attendant. “They started from nothing and worked so hard to be able to give themselves a life they loved,” says Aitchison, who is an only child. “Growing up around that has an effect on you.” Still, her restlessness bothers her. “How did I learn that taking a second to breathe is bad? I’m trying to unlearn that.”By opening up the bonnet on How I’m Feeling Now, Aitchison is acknowledging the group effort that goes into any pop package. She is working primarily with producer AG Cook (of the avant garde PC Music collective) and BJ Burton. And while fans are increasingly key to any musician’s success, this project involves them in a more genuine, reciprocal way than megastars such as Drake or Bieber, who tailor their music to TikTok in a craven attempt to engineer viral dance crazes.Yet watching her work out in the open, it’s also clear that Aitchison makes every creative decision. When she mentions her work-guilt, I suggest that nobody could say she hasn’t worked for her success. “Well, thanks,” she says glumly. “I don’t know – sometimes the story isn’t always portrayed…” She trails off. What does she mean? “There’s always a misconception about female pop artists. That’s just the unfortunate truth: ‘Did they write their own songs? Do they have their own opinions? Did they really make that decision?’” Everyone from Joni Mitchell to Björk has complained of the same scepticism.Aitchison’s DIY ethos has been there since she started playing raves at 15. Her parents would drive her from their home in Bishop’s Stortford to Hackney warehouses, where she shrieked about dinosaur sex in a peroxide wig while they waited to drive her home. “Playing in those more underground environments, and being exposed to fashion and LGBTQ+ culture – that was the first time I felt truly inspired to my core,” she says. “It was like I’d opened Pandora’s box.” She was signed by Atlantic Records off the back of those shows, and her early releases revamped a gothic pop that had lain dormant since the 1980s (think Shakespears Sister and Depeche Mode). Prior to the pandemic, she had mooted a tour of her 2013 debut album, True Romance. “It was one of the first things I really got stuck into – a lot of experimentation and figuring things out as they went along,” she explains. “Kind of a similar time to now.”That first album was a critical success but not a commercial one – unlike 2012’s I Love It, a fantastically bratty song Aitchison gave to Swedish duo Icona Pop because she knew it didn’t suit her (she couldn’t picture the music video, her litmus test for what makes an XCX track). The song became a global smash after featuring on HBO’s Girls, and Aitchison was asked incessantly whether she regretted giving it away (for the thousandth time: no). She was also asked if she could write more of the same, and she could (Fancy, her 2014 collaboration with Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, was a US No 1 for seven weeks), but she hated the production line aspect. Pop’s boundaries were more rigid then, and critics were confused by Aitchison’s evident mainstream potential but preference for more experimental material: “Is Charli XCX a pop star?” one headline asked. She often asked herself the same question.She put these frustrations into her 2014 album Sucker. But despite screaming, “Fuck you!” in the general direction of music execs on its title track, the album now sounds a bit like a boardroom’s idea of rebellion: naughty schoolgirl visuals, tame rock influences, references to the Rolling Stones. She moved on, releasing the 2016 EP Vroom Vroom and beginning to build her own mythology, namechecking herself and her collaborators in lyrics, ditching the cropped kilts for Matrix-worthy latex catsuits and sheer mesh. Hackneyed rock legends wouldn’t get a look-in now, would they? “It came with the confidence to know that people would get my references,” she says. “There’s probably, in all artists’ careers, this peak moment where you and your fanbase are so in line. I realised I didn’t need the Rolling Stones any more. I just needed me.”These days, stardom no longer depends on mass exposure and mainstream success. Social media’s most vocal fans (especially queer pop fans) have crowned a class of cult acts who might once have been dismissed as flops: musicians fluent in pop’s aesthetic while not necessarily aspiring to its scale, such as Haim, Christine and the Queens, and Carly Rae Jepsen – all of whom have collaborated with Aitchison. Her most recent album, 2019’s Charli, spawned two hits, with Troye Sivan and Lizzo, and this time, mainstream success felt more meaningful. “When I was younger, I didn’t know who I was – I wanted to fit in with the music I was making and the way I looked,” she explains. “Now I don’t feel that, and I think it speaks volumes for how the pop industry has changed.”Her teenage wall of hair has given way to a dip-dyed bob (now growing out), and the diplomacy is new, too. There was a period when Aitchison and her label seemed constantly at loggerheads she characterised them as too conservative for her quicksilver release pace. Is there still conflict? “If I say no, it makes it sound like there was in the past,” she says (though this is a matter of record). “Generally there’s less drama in my life, but I think that’s because I am more in control of my emotions and less frantic with the way I express myself. I have more confidence in the fact that I understand my own art better than anybody else. That keeps me level-headed.”I ask about Cross You Out, a song from the last album that she has said is about someone who “turned from my defender into my executioner”. Did she mean her former manager, Dave Bianchi, as fans have speculated? “That song… is definitely about change in my life,” she says, weighing her words. “Look, I don’t want to say anything bad about people I’ve worked with it’s not my style. I will say that, with any relationship, there’s a point where it feels like a breakup.”Usually, Aitchison says, she’s “not very easily impressed” by her work. But making How I’m Feeling Now has made her feel more generous towards herself. Producers she’s long admired but was too scared to ask to collaborate have been in touch. She’s also making a book to document the album’s creation, which she hopes will remind her of its communal spirit. (I’m reminded of the top comment on her video for Forever, which is pieced together from personal clips fans have sent her: “OMG my dog is in this, she passed away 5 years ago but she lives on in this video \u0026lt3.”)The weekend after the album comes out, Aitchison plans to stay in bed watching The Sopranos (she’s new to it). Maybe she’ll relax after that probably she won’t. “After a week, I’ll be spinning out,” she says with a laugh. Still, she will travel less and record more at home. How about work less? “Possibly,” she says.Our hour in Aitchison’s tight schedule is up. Later I check social media to see what she’s done with the rest of her day: she’s recorded an episode of her Beats 1 radio show, playing fans’ remixes of a new song, Claws and performed for a French magazine’s Instagram, as well as worked on the album. A few days later, she unveils the Claws video, which shows her dancing against a variety of green-screened landscapes, along with a blank version for fans to edit in the background of their choice (inevitably, she tweets, she gets superimposed on to porn).How I’m Feeling Now already has one important legacy. Aitchison says she has been surprised by how fast her label have moved to get it out, and plans to release two more albums this year.

The 24-year-old MC and King Krule affiliate’s EPs, this year and last, embody that nocturnal sound of south London, with his lambent two-step ditties and introspective rapping evoking bedroom pirate radio freestyles and lively club queue chatter.Comparisons with another slight white geezer with a preference for skippy garage beats are, perhaps, inevitable: Pinty grew up looking to Mike Skinner, as well as drum’n’bass MC Skibadee. But his main inspiration was his late brother, a garage MC and graffiti artist. City Limits, from last year’s EP of the same name, released on Peckham’s Rhythm Section label, is a tribute to how “1999-2002 was the real golden era” – his brother’s era, where soulful dance styles like UKG, broken beat and house coalesced.Last month, Pinty released the Midnight Moods EP, on the new label he co-runs – it’s a slight update of a similar 2015 release, but it sounds box-fresh, with guest production from Krule, under the alias DJ JD Sports, on opening downbeater It’s Just Life. All Nightly squeezes the nostalgia grapes with beep-beep horns similar to MJ Cole’s Sincere, while Go To Bed Pt 2’s dazed synths evoke night bus rides through an empty capital after the clubs have closed. They may still be closed for some time, but these tales of all-night escapades can bring the dancefloor to your living room any day.

In the midst of a pandemic, it becomes surrealIt is 7.53am, the last Wednesday in March, and at a courier depot in Athens, the sperm of a Bermudian mechanical engineering student arrives, carried in a nitrogen tank. For the last three days, I have followed the tank’s journey across Europe, loading and reloading the courier website as it made its way from a cryobank in Denmark through Germany to mainland Greece.The continent has been shutting down, borders closing as coronavirus spreads, and as the days have passed, the improbability of this delivery, its chances of ever reaching its destination, have seemed increasingly slim.It has one final leg, a short hop from Athens to the island of Crete. But today is Greek Independence Day, a national holiday, and so all through Wednesday and long into Thursday the sperm waits at the depot. I call the courier company. All planes being grounded, it will travel to its destination by boat, the handler says brightly. “It is very urgent,” I tell her. “It’s for a medical procedure.” She is reassuring but noncommittal. What I do not tell her is that, on Friday, I will have my eggs collected at a fertility clinic on Crete, and it is crucial that the sperm of the engineering student be there to meet them.Undergoing IVF at any time is a peculiar experience. In the midst of a pandemic, it becomes surreal. In early March, as the world shut down, I imagined my scheduled treatment would be postponed, but to my amazement the clinic said it would proceed. And so one Saturday afternoon, as the virus gathered pace and airports acquired a new and fearful mood, I took one of the last flights from London to Heraklion. I was making this trip alone my local health authority does not treat single women.With its own health system buckled by years of austerity, the Greek government had moved quickly to prevent a coronavirus outbreak of the magnitude of those in Italy or Spain. The evening I arrived, 14 March, Greece was on its way to lockdown, and Heraklion’s shops, bars and restaurants stood newly shuttered. I let myself into my rental apartment, ate the kalitsounia left by my host, and wondered what on earth I was doing.For some reason it is always taxi drivers who ask the question, though I imagine they are only voicing what others wonder: “Why don’t you have children?” I suspect many assume I didn’t want to be a mother, that I was too caught up in my career, that I left it too late. None of this is true. Having multiple miscarriages over many years, for which no medical investigation could find a cause, has been an exhausting, distressing and intensely lonely experience. And though my life has been rich and rewarding in many ways, the absence of a child is a sadness that has gnawed the edges of all other joys.When I wake, it is to the sound of wood pigeons, and piano practice, and Sunday church bells. The day is bright and warm, and for some time I wander the city’s empty, sunlit streets. The supermarket is closed, but I find a minimarket to buy a few groceries. Bread, feta, tomatoes. The owner regards me darkly across the counter, locking eyes as he sanitises his hands.So far there are only a handful of cases of the virus on the island. Soon there will be the first death: a German professor visiting the university for a conference. There is no room for tourists now. The swingers’ festival has been cancelled the beaches have closed. They will introduce a mandatory quarantine for new arrivals, close the hotels and the parks. I retreat to the apartment. That night I lie awake, listening to the wind and the cats yowling in the darkness.The clinic is a large, grey, modern building not far from the port. It takes 20 minutes to walk there in the rain, a fierce wind whipping in off the water. At the reception desk, I am told to stand behind a line as they fire a thermometer gun at my head, then permit me to ring the fertility centre doorbell. I fold the sleeve of my jumper over my thumb to press the buzzer.I will admit that I have not read up extensively on IVF. I have taken a strictly need-to-know approach, avoiding online message boards and support groups, spurning offers to bond with friends-of-friends over their own experiences. Each person is different, I have argued, each body is different. Still, as I stand waiting at the door, I realise that this means I have little idea of what to expect.A foreign clinic is disorienting when you are accustomed to another medical system: the rhythms are subtly different, the smells, the light all wrong. I notice the cigarette smoke on the senior nurse’s breath, the junior who chews gum behind her mask as she draws my blood. Even the tourniquet strapped around my arm feels flimsier than back home. “Take a breath,” the nurse says solemnly, as she inserts the needle. She leaves a small trail of blood along my skin, then dispenses the contents of the large syringe into several containers a spring-like gurgling sound that I find oddly hopeful.I walk home along the backstreets, past ageing stucco apartments and the sound of a couple arguing through an open window. When you are not familiar with a culture or a language, your senses become heightened – the colours louder, the sounds and scents more pronounced. I try to notice the details: the hover of wasps over the bowls of water left out for street cats. A snail on a bright blue wall. The firebug on an orange tree. It stops my mind from spiralling. I stop by the supermarket, where they are already limiting the number of customers, and plastic gloves are mandatory. But the shelves are full and no one is stockpiling.The following day, I return to the clinic. My blood test results have proved heartening and my consultant tells me he hopes for 15 or 16 eggs. He chatters warmly as he performs my ultrasound: about his time living in London in the days of disco, the fact that English women never cook. “I like to cook,” I tell him. “What do you cook? Sandwiches?” he asks, then reels off the measurements of my ovaries to his assistant. When I leave, the senior nurse gives me a face mask, ties it tightly so that it covers my nose, and rubs my back with a kind of tenderness. “It’s for you,” she says. “Make sure you wear it.”There is little new I can tell you about IVF medication. The basic protocol is to stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs, which are then removed, fertilised and returned a further array of drugs help make the pregnancy sustainable. And so for the weeks to come my days are measured out in injections, pills and pessaries, in the fiddliness of mixing powders and solutions, of needles and small glass vials. Soon my stomach is puffy and bruised my body feels distorted and misshapen.Meanwhile, I follow news of the pandemic on my laptop. I look at graphs and statistics. I listen to the BBC. Mostly I watch the UK with horror: its slow route to lockdown, the mad rush at the supermarkets, the people who flock to pubs and parks and jostle over toilet roll. There is none of that here. Rather, people move with a kind of quiet obedience. When my flight home is cancelled, I feel something like relief. I feel safe here.On 23 March, Greece grounds all flights to the UK and docks all boats to the islands. I can now only leave the house for an hour each day: to buy groceries, seek medical treatment or take exercise, and must first text the government for permission. A strange serenity settles over these days of confinement: I sleep well and long, read, work, take afternoon walks down to the waterfront. I do not return phone calls from well-meaning friends texts and emails go unanswered. I feel beholden to nothing besides my own body, feed it yoghurt and oranges and sesame snaps. One day I read that IVF clinics around the world are closing, that treatments are being postponed indefinitely, and am filled with a great swell of gratefulness.When I return to the clinic for my second ultrasound, my consultant is in a less jovial mood. He scowls slightly, as if I have disappointed him, tells me the ovarian stimulation has not been as successful as expected he now hopes for five eggs.I am accustomed to sitting in doctors’ offices receiving bad news. To be told repeatedly that you have lost your baby, that there is nothing they can do, that your identical twins have no heartbeat, develops a kind of composure. I have learned how to imperceptibly bite my lip, and close my eyes, and know that the grief will come later, far from here, when it will be solitary and wild and flailing.That I have done all of this alone is testament to what my friends call my terrible taste in men. I have a particular talent for choosing unsupportive partners, men who will ask you to choose between your baby and them, who will miss hospital appointments, and find commitments more pressing than helping you through a miscarriage.Last summer, I sat in my GP’s surgery and told her I wanted to pursue solo IVF. I pressed my fingernails into my palm to steady myself as I spoke. She was supportive and kind, and made a referral to the fertility department at the local hospital.I was not technically single at the time, but two weeks later I left my boyfriend of four years. Some months earlier I had learned that he had cheated on me, constantly, for the entirety of our relationship, including while I was pregnant. I had loved him more than I had loved anybody, and perhaps this was the reason I had tried to make things work, but the days had soon settled into a kind of mute despair.It was liberating to feel in charge of my own destiny again, and for the three months while I waited for my first appointment with the fertility clinic, I felt thrillingly alive. When it came, that appointment was dispiriting: the nurse explained my local health authority’s policy on treating single women. She was sympathetic, ordered a range of fertility tests, cautioned against using a donor I knew, and suggested I look at clinics abroad. “Greece,” she said. “They have some good clinics there.”There followed several months of waiting – for test results, for a round of MMR vaccinations (my GP had no record of my ever having had them). The new year turned and it was almost spring. I told the clinic in Heraklion, chosen for its impressive success rates and peaceful location, that I would come in March. I had not heard of coronavirus then, though already in China the disease was spreading. It seemed very far away. I focused instead on the small, steady world I had created, of fertility acupuncture, sobriety and sperm selection.It is easy to get lost in the process of choosing a sperm donor, to dwell upon academic qualifications, professions, favourite pastimes. The more you pay, the more you know: baby photos, adult photos, voice notes, family medical histories. Some cryobanks will supply handwriting samples and outline drawings of your donor’s face in profile this can have the strange effect of making everyone look like a criminal.Above all, I decided, let him be kind. From hundreds of donors, I whittled it down to two: the mechanical engineering student whose profile was somewhat restrained, but about whom the staff appraisal spoke glowingly and a Danish musician with wavy hair who talked about his love of nature and art. “He sounds like the kind of man I would date,” I told my friends. This was not necessarily a good thing, they pointed out. That night I lay in bed and imagined their profiles being read in the voices of my very worst boyfriends. I chose the engineer.Friday morning, the day of my egg retrieval, and the donor sperm has not arrived. The courier office can tell me only that it has left Athens. I take the coast road to the clinic, walk slowly through the uncertain morning, and try not to think about the catastrophe before me. The air is sweet and soft, the sea a searing blue. I am watching the light play on the waves when, just beyond the port, I see the daily cargo boat approaching the shore, bringing supplies from the mainland: food and medicine and a nitrogen tank of donor sperm.In the days that follow, I like to think of my eggs in the laboratory, cells iding, happily gathering into blastocysts. It makes me feel less alone. I await news from the embryologist, sleeping, eating, taking long walks. One morning, I wake to a ruffling sound beyond my bedroom curtains. It is a bird, I think, that has flown into my courtyard. But when I look I find it is rain: heavy, plump drops on the corrugated iron roof and the broad leaves of the potted plants. That day the embryologist calls: transfer will be in two days’ time.Another flight is cancelled. Getting home will now take some 42 hours, several changes of plane, and hundreds of pounds. “Do I need to come and rescue you?” an ex-boyfriend emails. I tell him he should know by now that I am not someone who takes well to rescuing. Perhaps if I did, I would not be here doing IVF alone in a foreign country in the first place.I am worried about the pigeons. The square outside the cathedral, in normal times surrounded by busy restaurants, lies quiet deprived of their usual scraps, the birds seem bewildered. They flock near the cathedral steps, as if hoping for mercy. I take to feeding them: crusts of bread and old kalitsounia that brings them flocking around my ankles, burbling and fluttering as they eat. I feed the cats, too, their thin little bodies winding against my calves.I am the only patient at the clinic on the morning of my embryo transfer. The number of treatments is dwindling as no one can travel and there is too much uncertainty. My consultant, the junior nurse, the embryologist and I gather in the operating theatre. The embryologist plays Mozart through her phone to drown out the whirr of the generator. It is a simple procedure – the embryo being transferred to the womb via a catheter. “There!” the consultant says. On the screen I watch a small dot make its way across the darkness and then settle.For the next two weeks it will become the pale white dot upon which I live. I think about my tiny speck of hope as I follow the growing bleakness of the world: nurses in London wearing bin bags and scuba masks, the want of ventilators in New York City, the death toll in Italy that rises and rises. I try not to think about how I will get home, about the potential dangers of travelling across a continent, newly pregnant, in a pandemic.In my isolation chamber I feel like a Russian doll, inside me another smaller me, confined in her own small isolation. I have been pregnant enough times that this state feels familiar: all-engulfing, electric. And yet I have miscarried enough to know that nothing is certain. I have often thought that the two-week wait between conception and pregnancy test is like being alone in a strange house: every sound, every shadow, can convince you that someone is there.For a week I feel truly pregnant. And then suddenly I do not. One day I wake to feel a tangible distance between the synthetic hormones and my own body. I do not tell anyone. Instead I walk down to the water, stay out far beyond the mandated hour. I marvel at the flicker of tiny fish moving between the boats in the harbour. I look at the bright yellow tangle of fishing nets, the deep pink of wooden shutters, the distant mountains, snow-peaked against the bluest sky.I walk on beside the sea, past young couples, hands entwined, and think of how clinical and lustless the IVF process is. Of how a week ago I sat in a room that smelled of disinfectant, wearing a thin blue gown and a surgical mask. How there was no one’s hand to hold, no love in the room. In the streets outside, spring had begun. There was the smell of orange blossom, and violet carpenter bees danced between branches. I stared up at the voluminous petals of bright red flowers, at stamen and pollen and anther and stalk, and thought that this was how reproduction ought to be: stickiness and scent, warmth and desire, all the senses colliding at once.On the day I get a negative pregnancy test, 717 people die of coronavirus in the UK. For a long while, I sit on the edge of my bed and try to balance rationality and sorrow. I look at pictures from Italian hospitals, follow the upward curves of the latest graphs. Friends have lost loved ones, I tell myself I have lost someone who barely ever existed. And yet I walk out into the cool sun of my courtyard and cry.Some years ago, the writer India Knight published a self-help book, In Your Prime, in which she discussed the way that in adulthood our lives erge into two camps: the have-children and the have-nots. For those caught up in the business of parenthood, she wrote, “there is no especial pleasure to be had in a single andor childless person banging on about the minutiae of their small, unpeopled little life”. The phrase has stuck with me. As my friends have paired off and become parents, I have seen them less, travelled more, grown quieter. I cannot hope to understand the dramatic shifts and expansions in their lives, just as they are unlikely to understand the reduction of my own.And as the weeks of lockdown rolled on, that phrase has returned to me anew I came to think how all our lives have grown small and unpeopled. How we have come to find pleasure in the minutiae: the slow drift of days, the unfurling of blossom, a street filled with clapping on a warm spring evening. And sometimes, too, when all seems lost, a small patch of blue sky above a courtyard in Greece."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/329f1114b7dbaa4ebda3e353f6efee492c1ec8d2/0_316_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=375882da49b1dcc31fdfb5ca39eb7358","title":"young people text counselling service shout lockdown","story":"Frontline workers twice as likely to mention anxiety when asking for help, Shout crisis line saysThousands of young people and frontline workers are turning to a text advice line for people in crisis during the coronavirus epidemic, as counsellors report a rise in anxiety caused by the lockdown.The helpline, which was launched a year ago with the backing of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and a £3m investment from the Royal Foundation charity, reported that frontline and key workers are twice as likely as others to mention anxiety. Conversations concerning Covid-19 peaked on days where there were significant announcements, such as those about school closures and other lockdown details.Prince William spoke to volunteer counsellors this week and said he was concerned that the service was not reaching enough NHS workers.“There is still quite a big stigma in the NHS about reaching out for support for mental health,” he said. “Because many of them believe they are the place people go to for support and they shouldn’t be asking others for support, which is wrong but that is the way they feel.”Counsellors told the duke and duchess they often received texts from frontline workers concerned about a lack of PPE and struggling with the conflict between continuing to do their job and isolating from their families.In the weeks before lockdown was announced on 23 March, volunteers typically fielded 750 conversations a day but that has grown to more than 900 as coronavirus became an increasing cause for concern.“During the Covid-19 lockdown we have seen young people are finding it useful to have a neutral person to listen confidentially to their worries over text, particularly when other support networks or services are not available or they don’t want a phone call to be overheard,” says Victoria Hornby, Shout’s chief executive.“Uncertainty and anticipation around personal and major life events has a significant impact on the mental health of young people, which settles when the picture becomes clearer. Lockdown at home can intensify difficult feelings and thoughts and our volunteers help people relieve this pressure and get to a calmer place.”Shout was launched to target young people more comfortable with texting than making phone calls or attending face-to-face counselling. The 85258 number handled 300,000 text conversations in its first year, with the most common issues raised being suicide, depression, anxiety, loneliness and self-harm.Across the whole year, people aged 18 to 24 were most likely to discuss suicide, even though people aged 45 to 49 are most likely to kill themselves in the UK. Under-13s were the age group most likely to discuss self-harm.Operators felt the need to call the emergency services for help 5,000 times in the last year over fears that texters might harm or try to kill themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c891f5a2fd5c006946447926f72205cd98ad7dd/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=73dd351b166024bd901dbc1081c5705c","title":"my dads piece of wales in canadia lakeside cottage","story":"The writer tells of tracing her father’s connection with a fellow Welshman who emigrated almost a century ago – and put down roots in OntarioA decade ago, my father, Terry Lee, found a wooden sign behind our cottage’s boathouse. He guessed it had once hung above the door, naming this Ontario lakeside property: Brynmorwydd. Dad, who grew up in Cardiff and emigrated to Canada in the 1970s, knew right away it was Welsh. But the cottage, which originally belonged to my stepmother’s family, was actually an exercise in Canadianness for my dad, who isn’t exactly handy with canoes or campfires. I don’t suppose he ever anticipated that it would draw him back to Wales, but some weeks later he spotted the name of the cottage’s first owner stamped on one of its beams: John G Bolt.He searched deeds, records, maps and censuses with the help of my uncle, and the story emerged of John Bolt, born in 1886 near Llanrhaeadr, north Wales. The son of a gamekeeper, he moved away to Cheshire at the age of eight, after his parents died. In 1927, Bolt sailed to Canada and worked on the Canadian Pacific Railway: he claimed a plot of land, built a cottage, and named it after the estate where he’d been born: Brynmorwydd.Dad and I arrived in Llanrhaeadr-yng-Nghinmeirch in summer 2013. Fog spread over the valleys, obscuring the sheep. It had been a decade since we’d holidayed together. While dad was renovating the cottage, I’d been living in England. But this trip was designed to bring us together: he wanted to track down the original Brynmorwydd I was doing a PhD in landscape history. We felt like an ideal team.Each day, we ventured out in search of clues: the estate no longer existed, and while some placenames remained, few buildings did. We had an 1875 OS map, which I compared with Google Maps, searching for the spot where Bolt was born.We stopped in the pub and chatted to the barman. “A bit of an odd request,” dad began, his Welsh lilt swimming into the corners of his now-Canadian accent. “We’ve come from Canada, where we own a cottage by the name of Brynmorwydd …” “You’ll want to talk to the gentleman in the corner,” said the barman, pointing to an elderly man eating Sunday dinner. “He grew up in the estate’s main house.”It seemed too coincidental. The man told us the land was up a narrow lane. And private. Undeterred, we drove up the winding lane to the crest of a hill. There was hardly anything there. An abandoned building, a gate, a No Trespassing sign and a wide valley view: a green quilt with hedgerow seams. Was this what John Bolt longed for? Dad pulled out a photograph of the wooden sign and posed for a picture.We open our cottage each year when the ice on our bay has melted. Among the teapots and old photographs, a folder entitled “John G Bolt” holds the papers we carried as we combed the countryside. On every visit, I open it to check the pages are in order, then look for my father. He may be fumbling to split logs or tidying the boathouse. Once in a while he’ll rest, looking over the water that stretches before our Brynmorwydd.Jessica J Lee is an author and environmental historian.

An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.It raises questions about the extent to which restrictions can be safely eased in coming weeks. In his address on Sunday, Boris Johnson said: “We have the R below 1, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below 1.”The slight increase and narrowing in range is not linked to lockdown relaxations this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago.A likely explanation is that while overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R. Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes.The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing.It comes as data showed that while London was a hotspot of infection at the start of the epidemic, attention is now shifting to the north of England, where transmission rates of Covid-19 appear to be falling far less steeply.Some epidemiological models suggest transmission rates in the capital are now half those seen in the north-east and Yorkshire, raising the question of whether all areas will be safe to emerge from lockdown at the same time.There is growing unease among civic leaders in the north of England at plans to ease lockdown rules, with one council leader branding it as “frankly, madness”.The leader of Gateshead council, Martin Gannon, said on Friday that the advice to the public to “stay at home” would continue. Gannon, whose views on lockdown were echoed by his counterparts in Newcastle and Sunderland, said there was evidence that the R rate was greater than 1 in his borough.How do models calculate the R value?The R value tells you how many infections each infected person passes the virus on to, on average. For an R above 1, the epidemic increases exponentially below 1 it will eventually fizzle out. In the absence of direct measures of this elusive number, modellers have to rely on what firm data we have and extrapolate from there.Some models, such as one by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University, rely on the numbers of reported deaths, and the steep, steady decline in deaths in London translates into an estimate that community transmission must have also rapidly dropped off.Deaths are reliable figures, less subject to biases than some other measures, but they reflect the infection rates that were occurring about three weeks previously and so do not give a dynamic reflection of where things are.Policy changes around working and socialising introduced in the past week may have influenced R, but a model based on deaths will not give any insights into this. The PHE model projected that there might be as few as 24 new cases in the capital per day on 10 May. This reflects the strong downward trend London has been on, but the model is not designed to give razor-sharp predictions of day-by-day infection statistics. On Thursday, 49 people with new infections were admitted to hospitals in London.Some models rely on measures such as symptoms reported to phone apps, which have a shorter lag time. However, these data are more “noisy” and so give a less robust measure of R overall, although they can give better insight into short-range changes.The data from hospital admissions and deaths also suggest that R has come down far more steeply in London than in other regions. The PHE and Cambridge model suggests that R in London is 0.4, compared with 0.8 in the north-east and Yorkshire and 0.75 for the country as a whole.This is one of a handful of models feeding into advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to government, and all are showing broadly similar patterns across the regions. However, the extent of the differences varies, meaning that an optimistic estimate for London cannot be relied on too heavily.Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, described the PHECambridge estimate for London as “extremely low”. His own team’s predictions put the London R value closer to 0.6.“This still predicts a faster decline in London than the rest of the country, but not as dramatic … The difference between 0.4 and 0.6 might sound like scientists arguing over small details, but these translate to very substantial differences in the rate of decline of cases, or the time for the epidemic to halve,” he said.Initially, London was a few weeks ahead of other regions of the country because far more infections were seeded there at the start of the epidemic. However, it has also seen a steeper decline and, in fact, may have always had a slightly lower community transmission rate than some other geographical regions.There are likely to be a wide range of factors behind this. London may now have a higher level of population immunity, which could be playing a role in bringing down transmission, since a higher proportion of people have been infected.“If it turns out that there’s loads of immunity in the community, then that’s brilliant, but I don’t think we should plan for that scenario,” said Thomas House, reader in mathematical statistics at the University of Manchester. “We don’t really know yet.”There are also likely to be substantially different contributions from hospitals and care homes, where transmission rates have not been effectively brought under control. In some regions, the spread of infection in these settings, where lockdown does not have the same impact, could be making a major contribution to keeping R close to 1.Differences in living arrangements – for instance, larger family groups living together outside London – could play a role. Models may also not fully capture the role of underlying health issues and deprivation in raising the risk of severe cases.There isn’t strong evidence for this. The lockdown has brought down transmission rates in the community across the country, and a forthcoming study from scientists at Imperial College London does not seem to suggest that London has been an outlier in terms of compliance.“The uniformity with which the UK responded to the lockdown is remarkable,” said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics. “I thought maybe people in London who were close to a large epidemic would be much more compliant than elsewhere. But the behaviour change was very well synchronised across the UK.”This is an emerging view among scientists. “Based on just the epidemiology, it makes a tremendous amount of sense,” said House. “There’s no point locking down if there’s no cases to prevent.” However, he and others acknowledge that the political decision will be weighted by factors beyond simply modelling the trajectory of case numbers.“It’s much more difficult to message the relaxation than it is to message the lockdown,” said Riley. “I suspect the most difficult aspect on possible regional differences is how you would message it. That uncertainty would be much greater than any mechanistic modelling uncertainty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28f61ad99df0e5d2261ea8deec8cd1e6abaa1dae/0_81_3245_1948/master/3245.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dd3ee3f20636e73c63a0d88ae59db65","title":"taiwan must accept chinese status to attend who assembly says beijing","story":"Former European leaders say world needs Taiwan’s expertise in tackling coronavirus Beijing has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan’s call to be represented at next week’s assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China.The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday, and Taiwan’s attendance – as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic – are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west.Chinese diplomats have been contacting governments across Europe to limit the diplomatic support for Taiwan’s attendance, targeting northern and eastern European states. Maintaining collective EU unity on China is proving difficult.But in a letter to the , the former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former president of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski and the former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt argue that Taiwan should be permitted to attend because of its pioneering response to the pandemic, which has drawn on the lessons of the 2003 Sars outbreak.“It is regretful that geopolitics has prevented Taiwan from fully accessing the forums and services of the World Health Organization – not least as the WHO could have benefited from its expertise,” the authors argue.Taiwan had observer status at the WHO for seven years until 2016, when it was blocked by China, as it has been every year since. Beijing believes Taiwan is deploying the WHO issue as a route to recognition internationally.Donald Trump – locked into a multifaceted dispute with China – is already withholding US funds from the WHO, which he describes as “China-centric.”He has led the calls for Taiwan to be admitted to the UN body, and support is also coming from Australia, the UK, Japan, Canada, Germany and New Zealand. China is also concerned it may be losing the support of India on the issue.Rasmussen argues next week’s assembly could prove a turning point in the fight against coronavirus, saying the pandemic has underlined the importance of robust multilateral coordination.In the letter, Rasmussen claims Taiwan’s success in controlling the virus shows the country has lessons to teach the rest of the world, adding its attendance “will have no wider implications than to ensure that 23 million people with something to offer are not excluded from exchanging best practices”.Taiwan’s health minister, Chen Shih-chung, said on Friday his country could not accept China’s conditions for its participation.“We have no way to accept something that does not exist,” Chen replied, referring to China’s demand that Taipei agree to its “one China” policy to attend the assembly.WHO officials say the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cannot invite Taiwan since there are ergent views on the issue within.The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has called for an independent inquiry into the crisis, writing: “To strengthen our defences against future pandemics, we also need a thorough, independent scientific inquiry into the origins of the crisis.” China has been resistant, and the terms of any inquiry, as well as its timing, will be contested.Last month, Tedros himself accused Taiwan of racist “attacks” over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, an allegation that Taiwan denied as “unprovoked and untrue”.Tedros’s claim came after Taiwan said in March that the organization had ignored its December warnings that human-to-human transmission of coronavirus was possible.A WHO tweet on 14 January said: “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.”But documents show that the international body warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has dismissed claims of Chinese dominance at the WHO as rumour and smear-mongering."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/682e49e795dd5cb1823c4a93266d6ca27d0505ae/0_135_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6b19d02a7815ea019ca0d46ec4d906e","title":"us coronavirus message god poll results","story":"The coronavirus has prompted almost two-thirds of American believers to feel that God is telling humanity to change how it lives, a new poll has found.In the US, the virus has killed more than 80,000 Americans and caused economic hardship for millions, but the findings of the poll by the University of Chicago Divinity School and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research indicate that people may also be searching for deeper meaning in the devastating outbreak.Even some who don’t affiliate with organized religion, such as Lance Dejesus of Dallastown, Pennsylvania, saw a possible bigger message in the virus.“It could be a sign, like ‘hey, get your act together’ – I don’t know,” said Dejesus, 52, who said he believes in God but doesn’t consider himself religious. “It just seems like everything was going in an OK direction and all of a sudden you get this coronavirus thing that happens, pops out of nowhere.”Kathryn Lofton, a professor of religious studies at Yale University, interpreted the high number of Americans perceiving the virus as a message from God about change as an expression of “fear that if we don’t change, this misery will continue”.“When people get asked about God, they often interpret it immediately as power,” said Lofton. “And they answer the question saying, ‘Here’s where the power is to change the thing I experience.’”Fifty-five per cent of American believers say they feel at least somewhat that God will protect them from being infected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 2","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Russia reported 9,200 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Saturday, with 119 deaths over the last 24 hours.

Rarer still for them to be turned away.But that is exactly what happened on Saturday when the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was turned away from a popular cafe in Wellington which was full due to coronavirus distancing measures.“Omg Jacinda Ardern just tried to come into Olive and was rejected cause it’s full,” a Twitter user named Joey wrote at about midday.His tweet was accompanied by a ghoulish emoji, suggesting he was horrified that space was not made for the Labour leader, despite restaurants being limited to a maximum of 100 people and at least 1 metre between seated groups. A quarter of an hour later, he added: “Never mind they sorted her out.”Arden’s partner, Clarke Gayford, responded to his tweet a few hours later, taking the blame for the brief hiccup to their day.“I have to take responsibility for this, I didn’t get organised and book anywhere,” he wrote. “Was very nice of them to chase us down st when a spot freed up. A+ service.”While leaders in other countries may send staff ahead to make arrangements, a spokesperson for Ardern’s office said waiting at a cafe was something anyone could experience during New Zealand’s virus restrictions: “The PM says she just waits like everyone else.”Without providing his name, the restaurant’s owner told the New Zealand Herald that he was pleased to be talking about “something light-hearted and fun” following “the drama and stress” of the previous two months.He confirmed no exceptions were made for Ardern and that she and Gayford were initially turned away by the restaurant manager. However, the manager then ran down the street minutes later, after a table became free, which he stressed is a courtesy extended to other customers.Fewer than 1,500 people have been infected with Covid-19 in New Zealand, and 21 people have died, after the government pursued a vigorous elimination strategy, shutting its borders on 15 March and entering a country-wide lockdown 10 days later.As the country edges back to normal, the incident shows that while New Zealand’s prime minister has reached near record-breaking approval levels, the country is remaining vigilant. “We’re following every one of the rules,” Olive’s owner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44496b880652dfe454ac910d2107eb7c6b8f2be7/0_100_5677_3407/master/5677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e497a296b0f0f65068fdd83260218014","title":"uk coronavirus live stop squabbling over school closures says childrens commissioner","story":"Latest updates, news and information on the Covid-19 pandemic in the UKAll residents and members of staff in care homes in Wales will be able to get a coronavirus test, the Welsh government has said.The health minister, Vaughan Gething, said the change follows the latest scientific advice and brings Wales into line with England.Opposition politicians said the original decision not to test everyone in care homes should be the subject of a future inquiry. From now, every care home in Wales will have access to testing and will be able to order online testing kits for their residents and staff.Previously only residents and staff in care homes with confirmed cases of coronavirus were tested, as were homes with more than 50 beds, anyone being discharged from hospital into a care home, or anyone moving into a care home from the community.Today is a step change in how we will be testing in care homes, adapting our policy so that every resident and member of staff can be tested for coronavirus. I hope this brings further reassurance to those living and working in care homes and their families.Testing in Wales had been more restrictive than in England, where all care home residents and staff have been eligible for testing regardless of symptoms since the end of April.The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said at the time there was not a “clinical value” in testing everyone where no one was displaying symptoms.This is a long-awaited recognition of what we have consistently argued for.The tragic cases of Covid-19 in care homes and its prevalence within them should have been a wake-up call for the Welsh government that testing everyone was a necessary life-saving step.The refusal to do so up to now should be the subject of examination in the future inquiry.While it is a welcome change of approach, ministers must now publish the advice which informed the previous policy of not testing in every care home and how it has now changed.A further 468 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died, taking the total across all settings in the UK to 34,466, the DHSC said.A new “home-school” competition for children and young people has been launched to explore black British history and multicultural Britain.The competition, sponsored by the National Education Union (NEU), is part of the 100 Great Black Britons campaign created by Patrick Vernon to celebrate thecontinued legacy and achievements of black people in Britain.The current crisis has highlighted the centrality of black people in Britain, to the NHS and care work, transport systems, food supplies, utilities, research, education and so much more. Arike Oke, managing director of Black Cultural Archives, said:Black history in Britain goes as far back as it’s possible to go.

BTP has confirmed Ch Supt Eddie Wylie returned to Yorkshire from his rented flat in Glasgow on two occasions between 21 March and 13 May, but claimed he did not breach Covid-19 regulations – after the UK went into lockdown on 23 March.It said that on both occasions he travelled home alone and by car to minimise any possible exposure to others. British Transport Police is a national police force with its headquarters in London, and as such our officers are required to regularly travel across England, Scotland and Wales for essential meetings or as operationally required. In these instances, Ch Supt Wylie will stay at whichever address is the most convenient.Our officers can be posted anywhere in the UK, at any time. This means it is not unusual for them to have their family home in one part of the country and rent other accommodation nearer to where they are currently stationed. Crucially, the restrictions state that people should only leave the place they are living if they have a reasonable excuse. This includes travelling for the purposes of work where it is not reasonably possible for that person to work from the place they are living. It would not be reasonably possible for Chief Superintendent Wylie to perform his role solely from either the Glasgow address, or his home in Yorkshire.British Transport Police officers are currently playing a crucial role as s of the lockdown. Alongside the Scottish Government and Police Scotland, the BTP’s message to the people of Scotland has rightly been to stay at home, and avoid any unnecessary travel.People across Scotland and the whole UK have made huge sacrifices during this time, including missing family funerals and spending precious time away from their loved ones. But it seems as if the BTP’s top officer in Scotland has failed to learn the lessons of the Catherine Calderwood debacle, and believes there is one rule for him, and one rule for the rest of us. This could have serious consequences for the BTP’s ability to police the lockdown, which could in turn endanger public safety in Scotland. Eddie Wylie has serious questions to answer.NHS England has announced 181 more deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths in hospitals in England to 24,527.Of the 181 new deaths announced today:- 39 occurred on 15 May - 89 occurred on 14 May - 22 occurred on 13 May The figures also show 23 of the new deaths took place between 3-12 May. The remaining eight deaths occurred in April, the earliest being on 4 April.NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago.

At the moment there are no clear answers and I think we are probably on the right track. We have been taking a tough line here and we’ll have to see how that goes. I didn’t notice that he’s received a lot of criticism.Asked about his son’s own bout of coronavirus, which included a stay in intensive care, he said he “felt as any father must feel when his son is at death’s door”. Before strict lockdown measures were introduced, he said he would ignore his son’s advice to avoid pubs.“Of course I’ll go to a pub if I need to go to a pub,” he said.The Department of Health has said mass high-quality testing is an integral part of dealing with coronavirus after the chair of the Royal College of GPs said doctors were concerned about the government’s strategy.We do not believe that there is sufficient clarity on a joined-up comprehensive testing strategy to prevent a second wave of infections and to secure the overall health of the population. As we ease lockdown over the coming weeks and months, it is essential that the profession and patients have full confidence in the approach to test, track and trace.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: High-quality testing on a mass scale is an integral part of our strategy to stop the spread of the virus and save lives. Thanks to the significant increases in capacity which we have built at pace, tens of millions of people are now eligible for tests and we have been able to prioritise our frontline health and care staff, essential workers and the most vulnerable, including in our care homes.Thousands of young people and frontline workers are turning to a text advice line for people in crisis during the coronavirus epidemic, as counsellors report a rise in anxiety caused by the lockdown.The helpline, which was launched a year ago with the backing of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and a £3m investment from the Royal Foundation charity, reported that frontline and key workers are twice as likely as others to mention anxiety. Conversations concerning Covid-19 peaked on days where there were significant announcements, such as those about school closures and other lockdown details.Around three dozen people have gathered in Hyde Park to protest against the coronavirus lockdown and the principle of mandatory vaccinations, with at least two people led away in handcuffs so far.Standing close together near Speaker’s Corner, several held placards and banners including slogans like “freedom over fear” as police, including some on horseback, looked on, PA reports.David Samson, 50, who said he works in finance, said he was attending the protest because “I never thought I’d see in my generation the suppressing of civil rights” over what he falsely described as a “fake virus”.

Illustration: Michael Viney Early to my desk, I found the hillside seriously somnolent: the ewes still pillowed, their lambs close and dozing. The ocean gleamed with zig-zags of calm and the strand was as bare as the whole bank holiday Monday.But then, at the far ditch, a bird rose sharply into the air. Dark and floppy-winged, it flung itself aloft, climbing and circling house-high above the pasture, abruptly tumbling and plunging, then rising again – and again.Even without its distant, creaky cries, the flashes of white beneath the wings declared a cock lapwing in territorial display, new and exciting to me as I watched across the hedge. Wheatears and pipits in that rough meadow, yes, but breeding lapwings were new. Soon, however, in an odd lurch of hops from one fencepost to the next, the bird vanished and did not reappear. His solitary display, bereft of any female lapwing, had left him to wander on.Ireland’s lapwing, like the curlew and other ground-nesting waders, seem doomed to a dismal decline. Their breeding range in Ireland has halved and at the Shannon callows, once a stronghold, numbers are down by more than 80 per cent.BirdWatch Ireland, with Government support, is seeking help from citizen scientists in a national survey of breeding pairs: follow Project Lapwing on Twitter or at Bioersity Ireland.Meanwhile, my lonely lapwing set me thinking of all the birds in springtime that never find a mate. “Floaters” as ornithologists call them, have a largely unknown life. But now, from eagles to sparrows, their role in conserving bird populations is under growing study.‘Limit to multiplication’Floaters themselves are scarcely new – Darwin was aware of non-breeding birds. And one of Ireland’s finest field naturalists, Charles Moffat, was the first to hint at their significance. In a paper in the Irish Naturalist in 1903, on the spring rivalry of birds, Moffat offered “some views on the limit to multiplication”. They challenged the widespread idea that, for bird population to remain stable, up to 90 per cent of new young birds must die.Spring rivalry for territory, he argued, “results in such a parcelling out of land as must limit the number of breeding pairs to a fairly constant figure and prevent indefinite increase. . . at the same time condemning the less powerful iniduals to unproductiveness rather than death.”In what’s sometimes known as “Moffat’s Equilibrium”, non-breeders are available to fill nesting vacancies, a buffer that can protect populations from decline or extinction.Some floaters may hang around on the fringe of breeding territories, living secretive, unstudied lives or perhaps sneaking the odd “extra-pair copulation” as they wait for a vacant territory.In birds such as crows, swans and waders, non-breeders occur separately in flocks, sometimes of nearly half the population. Some may also act as “helpers” to active families. In Greenland, with ornithologist David Cabot, I watched as pairs of barnacle geese, marshalling their chicks against marauding Arctic foxes, were joined by non-breeding geese in a fierce, deterrent beating of wings.With May so much the month of the cuckoo, I inquired of Google Scholar as to the occurrence of male floaters: how many of them go on carolling in vain? But any such research eluded me. Spare females, I learned, do exist and may be hunted out of the territories of breeding cuckoo pairs.Notorious lifestyleTo describe them as pairs seems ill-fitting, given the notorious lifestyle in which the female lays her eggs in the nests of unwitting songbirds (in Ireland, mainly the meadow pipit).Indeed, the female is rarely seen, keeping well under cover between her swift and parasitic sorties, but also hunting the hairy caterpillars that most other birds reject. Her sex life can be arduous, given the frequent, pressing attention of the male, which can sometimes yield up to 25 eggs in a season. Females have been seen with two or more pursuers.Such sexual harassment has even been linked to the colour of their plumage. Most cuckoos of both sexes resemble some sort of hawk, with greyish back, barred underparts, long tail and direct, dashing flight. But some females are quite rufously brown, like their young.Experiments with decoy females have found that males “attempted to copulate more frequently and excessively with the grey morph”, suggesting evolution of the brownies as a female-only force for selection.As I write, early in May, no cuckoo has arrived on this side of the hill. The Burren and Connemara usually have the greatest density of pairs, but the species is rapidly declining in both islands.In the UK, the British Trust for Ornithology tracks the migration of five satellite-tagged cuckoos on their spring return from the forests of the Congo. It has a webpage that maps their routes, and on last inspection four of the birds had arrived in England in April.In Ireland, records in the whole island are collected by Dr Damien McFerran at the Ulster Museum (habitas.org.ukrecordssubmit-cuckoo-record).

Dental practices must also source and pay for their own PPE. Video: John Cassidy\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris met the dental association on Friday morning. Dentists will be able to reopen for routine services if they can adhere to newly published infection control guidance, the Department of Health has confirmed.The department said dental practices would be able to provide regular treatments again next week after being closed – except for emergency treatments during the lockdown – if they can follow the guidance published on Friday by the State’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre.The exact timing of the opening of dental practices for routine dentistry had not been clear with the Irish Dental Council previously saying practices would be able to reopen on Monday with the first wave of restriction relaxations or shortly afterwards. Dentists had been awaiting further advice from the council, the regulator of the profession, or the Department of Health’s National Public Health Emergency Team.The Irish Dental Council said it would consider the revised guidance when it meets shortly. It was unable to say when this meeting would take place.The State’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) published a 14-page revised guidance document for dentists on Friday afternoon on how to manage dental practices to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Speaking at a Government press conference approving the first wave of lockdown relaxations from Monday, Mr Harris said the expert guidance on reopening to routine services would “enable dentistry to recommence in a safe manner”.The new guidance for dentists includes a recommendation on the use of a Perspex screen at dental surgery receptions.Health officials have also removed a previous recommendation not to use aerosol-generating procedures and advice to wear a mask and eye protection when using them.GuidanceThe Irish Dental Association said the guidance would help dentists reopen and “allows the possibility of more treatments being provided subject to the dentists following this guidance”. Fintan Hourihan, chief executive of the association, said there may be some dentists who “would not be as ready as they like to reopen from Monday because they are only just seeing the official guidance,” but he expects most to be able to restart routine services next week once officially approved.Mr Hourihan, who represents 2,000 dentists, said that there would be “a backlog” for patients waiting to be seen and they were “not all going to be accommodated on Monday”.“Inevitably there is going to be a backlog and that dentists will have to prioritise,” he said.Mr Harris met the dental association on Friday morning along with senior HSE official Professor Martin Cormican, who is the lead adviser on the revised guidance. The dental sector has raised concerns about the availability of personal protective equipment and FFP2 face masks - a higher medical grade of mask than normally used - and funding supports for dentists who are struggling due to practice closures or reduced services. There is concern that the general shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the coronavirus pandemic may prevent some dental surgeries from recommencing regular services.Mr Hourihan said the Minister had suggested dentists may be able to avail of the Department of Business Covid-19 “restart” grant.But he told the Minister nearly a third of practices that applied for the Government’s Covid-19 temporary subsidy scheme had been unsuccessful, and 71 per cent of practices that applied for other financial support packages had been unsuccessful.Mr Hourihan told the minister the Covid-19 pandemic has had “a horrendous effect” on the profession as incomes had fallen dramatically in the lockdown. The HSE is still assessing PPE required by dentists. A spokeswoman for the health service said it had received a request for PPE from the dental profession and that it would complete a review of the demand for both public and private dentists in the coming days.“This exercise, and the associated approvals process, will allow us to determine the extent to which we can meet the demand,” she said.“Notwithstanding the challenging procurement environment in which we are operating, we are intent on supporting this request to the very best of our ability.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the North rises to 4,357With restrictions to ease Monday,experts say to socialise outdoors, limited to small groups face coverings advised on public transportDublin Fire Brigade says smoke from fire can be seen across the city promoting many callsHardware store is set to reopen on Monday after being closed for the last seven weeksIreland Performs allows Irish artists to present their work online and be paid \u0026euro1000Cork County mayor says July 12th event in Buttevant poses too great a risk to public healthGuidance on infection control was published on Friday by State\u0026rsquos Health Protection Surveillance CentreIHCA says 800,000 people on a waiting list -

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe People should continue to avoid visiting friends’ homes and only socialise in outdoor, public locations, the director of the national virus reference laboratory Dr Cillian de Gascun has said.From Monday, the State will enter the first stage of lifting the Covid-19 restrictions which have brought commercial and social life to a halt since March. Under this first phase of re-opening the country, groups of four people may meet outdoors once they observe social distancing, according to Government guidelines. However, Dr de Gascun urged people not to become complacent about social distancing when meeting with friends and warned that gathering in people’s gardens could lead to visitors using bathroom and kitchen facilities. He also cautioned against using people’s glasses or cutlery when visiting friends. “It’s just adding additional risk,” Dr De Gascún told RTÉ’s Saturday with Cormac Ó hEadra programme. “If you’re handing me a beer that’s fine, it can go straight into the bin or you can leave it on the wall… but if you’re giving me utensils or delph from your house, I’m seeding the virus on it.”People should avoid interactions over 15 minutes and not meet multiple groups of people in one day, he said. He also advised that people restrict their social interactions to a small circle of friends and family in the coming weeks. Dr de Gascun said it was “likely” there would be an increase in cases following the lifting of restrictions due to people’s movement but that the full impact would not become clear for at least five days. “It’s going to be week two by the time we see what effect lifting restrictions has had. That’s why we wanted a three week period so we can analyse the first two weeks.”“The only way we can prevent people dying is by quenching virus activity in the community. So the community really is where everything starts and that’s where we want people to stay at home and minimize their interactions because any increase in cases in the community will have a knock on effect to hospitalisation.”Prof Gerry Killeen from UCC’s school of biological earth and environmental sciences, who has worked on malaria transmission control and methods to combat the Zika virus, said it was “absolutely” too soon to be lifting restrictions and that they should remain in place until the end of the summer or early autumn. International data indicates the death rate in Italy and New York is “still the tip of the iceberg of what would happen if we just let this epidemic rip”, he said. Prof Killeen cautioned that while testing and treatment was a vital part of the response to the virus, it would not hold back the spread of the pandemic. Public transport The National Transport Authority (NTA) has said it will continue to operate a revised timetable for bus, train and tram transport services from next Monday with extra capacity to be added across public transport as required.All passengers are advised to wear face coverings when using public transport from next week following Government advice that people use facemasks in crowded indoor locations and when on public transportation as restrictions are lifted. Asked why the wearing of masks on public transport had not been made compulsory, Dr de Gascun said certain people may have problems wearing face coverings because of breathing difficulties or allergies while others may need to see people’s mouths for lip reading. Dr Holohan warned on Friday that “we cannot regard face coverings as some sort of magic shield . . . It’s a supplement to the other measures we are recommending.”“This is an additional hygiene measure, it’s not a magic bullet for this disease, and that has to be understood.”NTA chief executive Anne Graham urged people to only use public transport if their “journey is essential” and to otherwise considering cycling or walking to their destination where feasible.“If public transport is their only option, they should follow public health guidance when travelling,” Ms Graham said. The NTA said any anticipated increase in passenger numbers would be “closely monitored” and that “enhanced daily cleaning” would continue to take place including the daily sanitising of frequently touched surfaces on board all vehicles and at depots and terminal points across the country. Almost all buses, trains and trams are now receiving at least one additional cycle of cleaning during the day, a statement from the transport authority said. The NTA said it would publish proposals “shortly” around the provision of enhanced public transport services in line with the Government’s roadmap for reopening society and that any decisions would be guided by the National Public Health Emergency Team and advice from the chief medical officers. The deaths of a further 16 people from Covid-19 were confirmed by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Friday night as well as an additional 129 cases.There has been anxiety in Government that people will “descend on hardware stores and garden centres in large numbers” once the rules are relaxed on Monday, resulting in a rise in rates of infection.At a press conference in Government Buildings on Friday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar – flanked by Minister for Health Simon Harris, Minister for Business Heather Humphreys and chief medical officer Tony Holohan – said it was a “calculated evidence-based risk to ease the lockdown”.The first phase of the reopening of the country will see construction and other outdoor work permitted, some retail outlets such as hardware – but not homeware – shops allowed to open their doors. Retailers expressed disappointment at the late exclusion of homeware stores but Mr Harris said “now is not the time to decide I’m going to dicky up the house”.Dublin City Council has confirmed that from Monday, allotments, car parks associated with outdoor amenities, tennis courts and golf courses at Silloge and Tolka valley will re-open. The causeway road to the Bull Island Nature Reserve will re-open to vehicles along with a new dedicate cycleway while the number of outdoor staff at work across all service areas will increase. Arrangements are also being made for people returning to work in construction, said the council.

It wants protections of environmental standards and labour rights to be part of the deal, to avoid British industry undercutting EU competitors.Mr Frost said such commitments would bind Britain to EU laws and standards in a way that is unprecedented in other free trade agreements.“It is hard to understand why the EU insists on an ideological approach which makes it more difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. We very much need a change in EU approach for the next round beginning on June 1st. In order to facilitate those discussions, we intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EU’s member states and interested observers can see our approach in detail,” he said.Both sides agreed that there had been slight movement on the issue of fisheries, where each had begun with polar opposite positions, the EU advocating for a continuance of the status quo and Britain insisting it would reclaim exclusive rights for its fishing industry alone in its territorial waters.\u0026nbspTalks on finding a compromise will resume in the next round of negotiations, which begin on June 1st.Britain will next week publish the draft legal texts it has shared with EU negotiators but not with member-state governments. It will also publish a document outlining how it plans to implement the Northern Ireland protocol.‘A bit tetchy’A senior British official close to the negotiations said this week’s talks were “a bit tetchy at times”, adding that Mr Barnier was doing a good job but was burdened with a negotiating mandate that was not negotiable with Britain.“The problem continues to be that the EU think that they can get a halfway house between what we’re willing to see on so-called level playing field and what they’re willing to see, what we’re willing to live with on fisheries and what they’re wanting to see. We tried to make clear from the start that there isn’t a halfway house. You can’t split the difference between areas where we control our own laws and that’s a fundamental difficulty that the EU has not yet accepted,” the official said.After weeks of stalemate and a tight negotiating timetable that was curtailed further by the coronavirus pandemic, calls have grown for Britain to request an extension to the transition period to give the talks more time, which survey data indicates has majority public support.\u0026nbspThe British Irish chamber of commerce appealed to the government of prime minister Boris Johnson to buy time so that businesses were not burdened with tariffs and regulations while at their “most vulnerable”.The British government has insisted it will not ask for an extension, and last week cabinet minister Michael Gove said that tariffs were a “price” London was willing to pay.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Or might the onset of summer and the warmer, brighter weather, be helping to suppress the virus?Here is what we know about the effect of climate, weather, sunshine and Vitamin D on coronavirus:Latest research suggests that coronavirus is following a very specific path around the globe, leaving some countries unscathed, while having a disproportionately devastating impact elsewhere. The University of Maryland found that most cases fall along a narrow east-west corridor of 30 and 50 degrees of latitude, which includes northern Italy, the Pacific Northwest, Japan, Iran, South Korea, France, Spain and Germany. All share similar climatic conditions. In contrast, areas which were expected to be hardest hit, because of geographical proximity and travel connections to the Chinese outbreak - such as Southeast Asia - have had low infections and deaths compared to those in the ‘coronavirus belt’.Weather records in the hardest hit countries had similar average temperatures of between 5°C and 11°C and humidity of 47 to 79 per cent, which is close to laboratory conditions in which coronavirus thrives.None of the temperatures in badly affected cities dipped below 0°C during the height of the epidemic, which may suggest a threshold beyond which the virus cannot survive.The University of Oxford also recently conducted a review into whether climate conditions were playing a role in the transmission of coronavirus, and found that cold and dry conditions appear to boost spread. They found that while the global death rate was 0.2 per cent, in the northern hemisphere it was 0.3 per cent and even discovered a gradient relationship in Italy, with the south being less impacted than the north.Analysis of the previous Sars outbreak in Hong Kong has shown that the number of daily cases was higher on days where the weather was cooler and research has shown that viruses are able to live far longer on surfaces when it is cold.Warmer weather also leads to less people huddled together indoors, so the virus has less chance to jump from person to person.There is growing evidence that Vitamin D is protective against coronavirus and that people with chronically low levels may be at greater risk.Researchers from the Anglia Ruskin University compared the numbers of coronavirus cases to the average levels of vitamin D for 20 European countries and found a significant correlation.Italy and Spain have both experienced high mortality rates, and scientists found both countries have lower than average vitamin D levels.This is partly because people in southern Europe, particularly the elderly, avoid strong sun, while their darker skin pigmentation also reduces the body\u0027s ability to produce natural vitamin D.In contrast, the highest average levels of vitamin D are found in northern Europe, due to high consumption of cod liver oil and vitamin D supplements, and possibly less sun avoidance.Scandinavian nations are among the countries with the lowest number of Covid-19 cases and mortality rates per head of population in Europe.Dr Lee Smith, Reader in Physical Activity and Public Health at Anglia Ruskin University, said: “Vitamin D has been shown to protect against acute respiratory infections, and older adults, the group most deficient in vitamin D, are also the ones most seriously affected by Covid-19. “A previous study found that 75 per cent of people in institutions, such as hospitals and care homes, were severely deficient in vitamin D.”Vitamin D modulates the response of white blood cells, preventing them from releasing too many inflammatory cells which may stop the body overreacting to the virus. A study by Trinity College Dublin and University of Liverpool published this week also shows that vitamin D appears to help reduce serious complications in coronavirus patients.It has also been pointed out by experts that black and minority ethnic (BAME) iniduals living in northerly latitudes are often deficient in vitamin D which may partly explain the higher death rates in these groups. During the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, doctors noticed that patients who were nursed outdoors appeared to fare better. Sunlight is known to be germicidal and there is growing evidence that it can kill viruses as well. Viruses tend to survive better in cold weather because they have a fatty protective coating which degrades when it is warm. While the melting of the coating allows the virus to invade the warmth of the body, it dies if the casing disintegrates outside.One study by Harvard University showed at 6°C in dry weather, flu on a surface survived for more than 23 hours, but at a temperature of 32°C it was dying within an hour. And bright sunlight can quickly heat up surfaces beyond 32°C even if the outside air temperature is lower. Britain experienced the sunniest April on record which has coincided with a substantial fall in new cases. The UK had an average of 224.5 hours of sunshine last month, compared with 211.9 hours in April 2015, the previous highest.Prof Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor in the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University of Nottingham, said: “Sunlight includes ultraviolet radiation. This damages DNA and RNA.  “I have not seen any work on how quickly this affects Covid-19 but viruses left on surfaces outside will dry out and be damaged by UV light in sunlight.”Researcher Dr Richard Hobday, author of the Healing Sun and The Light Revolution, said that during the First World War, military surgeons routinely used sunlight to heal infected wounds.“Public health advice in the 1918 pandemic was sleep with your bedroom windows open and get out in the fresh air and sunshine. “Hospital patients who were nursed outdoors in tents and put in the sun seem to have recovered far better than those indoors.”Earlier this week, Giving evidence at the science and technology select committee, Professor Alan Penn, the chief scientific adviser at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said being outdoors will help prevent people from contracting the virus.“The science suggests that being outside in sunlight, with good ventilation, are both highly protective against transmission of the virus.”Open-air therapy was once a popular treatment for deadly respiratory conditions such as tuberculosis, and patients were regularly put outside to breathe the fresh air until antibiotics became standard in the 1950s.As early as the 1960s, the Ministry of Defence had shown that outdoor air is a natural disinfectant, able to kill the flu virus and other harmful germs.Hospital wards were once ‘cross-ventilated’ with large windows to allow fresh air to move freely, but modern hospitals mostly have closed systems and depend on air conditioning for their air supply.In March, scientists from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore found that coronavirus could spread around buildings via air conditioning systems or even on a draught, after discovering traces of the virus in a hospital air duct.Prof Neal said that fresh air quickly dispersed any droplets of coronavirus that are in the atmosphere.“Talking and coughing can produce droplets and aerosols. Droplets, which are larger than aerosols, carry more virus but fall rapidly to the ground under gravity. “Aerosols are smaller and can drift further but also dry out quickly because they lose water content as they have a high surface area to volume unlike droplets. They are also rapidly dispersed with air movements and we rarely have no air movements outside.“I intend to avail myself of the new recommendations and go fishing and play golf.  The risk is miniscule and I think I am more likely to be killed by lightning.”Dr Hobday added: “It\u0027s far easier to catch a respiratory infection indoors than outside - especially if ventilation rates are low. “And forcing people to stay indoors has prevented them getting out in the sun and building up their vitamin D levels after a long winter.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"first english national visit japan became honorary samurai formally","story":"An Englishman who became shipwrecked in Japan in 1600 and later rose the ranks to become a Samurai: the tale of William Adams\u0027 life sounds like the plot of an adventure story.  Now, the remains of Adams - the first English person to set foot in Japan - can be formally identified today, the 400th anniversary of his death in 1620, after forensic tests and painstaking research in Japan and Britain.Born in Gillingham in 1564, Adams fought against the Spanish Armada in 1588 before signing up a decade later to serve as a navigator on a Dutch ship sailing with four others to the Far East. The storm-battered ship limped into Usuki, in southern Japan, in April 1600.He survived threats of execution to become a respected figure in Japan, although he had to consent to never see his family back home again after rising through the ranks.The path to identifying his remains began in July 2017 on a site on Sakigata Hill, overlooking the town of Hirado in Nagasaki Prefecture, after a small funerary urn was discovered by excavators.The urn contained bones that had been discovered during a dig carried out in 1931 of a Western-style grave that was rumoured to be the site chosen by Adams for his last resting place.Nearly 90 years later, and despite just five per cent of the complete skeleton surviving, advances in genetic sequencing have confirmed that the bones are of a northern European who was aged between 40 and 59 when he died.The DNA testing, conducted by experts at the University of Tokyo, also shows that the man died sometime between 1590 and 1620, which also tallies neatly with Adams’ death.At least eight other Englishmen were known to have died in Hirado around the same time, although an investigation by the Tokyo-based William Adams Club has ruled out the remains as those of another Englishman.Foreigners were buried in their own cemetery in the port town, while Adams had asked to be interred on the top of a hill with a view of the ocean. Japanese records show that he obtained - either by purchasing or as a gift - a small plot of land at the top of Sakigata Hill sometime around 1613.“Throughout the modern era, and probably before then, this site has been associated with Miura Anjin,” said Robin Maynard, president and founder of The William Adams Club, referring to Adams by his Japanese name. “Miura” is taken from the peninsula south of Tokyo where he had his estate and “anjin” translates as the pilot of a ship.“The skeletal remains rediscovered in 2017 are completely consistent with the known characteristics of Adams himself, in terms of sex, country of ancestral origin, age at death, and year of death,” Professor Richard Irving, a member of the club, told The Daily .“The possibility that the bones belong to another person of north-west European origin is refuted, on the grounds that almost all English and Dutch traders, or mariners from visiting trading ships, known to have died in Hirado were buried with their compatriots in small ‘national’ cemeteries,” said Mr Maynard, who donated £23,000 of his own money to fund the excavation work.Mr Maynard said The William Adams Club hopes to make Adams as well known in Britain as he is in Japan, where his story is still taught in schools.Initially threatened with execution, Adams and the rest of his crew were imprisoned at Osaka Castle in the orders of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the future shogun. Adams reportedly met Tokugawa Ieyasu three times in the summer of 1600 and impressed him with his knowledge of international maritime issues and the technology of ships of the day that the two men became friends.Tokugawa Ieyasu was so pleased with the first ship that Adams oversaw, a western-style vessel of more than 70 tonnes that was used to carry large blocks of stone for the building of Edo castle, that he ordered him to construct a larger version.The sailor became a regular visitor to the palace and in 1609 he was commissioned to conduct negotiations with the rulers of New Spain, in present-day central America.The shogun clearly respected Adams’ diplomatic skills and engineering knowledge and officially appointed him as a personal adviser on trade and international relations. He even supplanted a Jesuit priest as the shogun’s official interpreter.As an expression of his gratitude, the shogun built Adams a house in the Nihonbashi district of what is today Tokyo and later granted him an estate near Yokosuka, south-west of Tokyo, and elevated him to samurai status.Significantly, he was also the joint negotiator, along with Captain John Saris of the East India Company, of the first Anglo-Japanese diplomatic and trade agreement in 1613.The downside of the arrangement was that Adams was forbidden to leave Japan, despite having a wife and children in England. Adams was prevented from returning to England as early as 1602, by which time he had a child in Japan and was obliged to marry the mother.Events marking the 400th anniversary of Adams’ death are planned for later in 2020, including the unveiling of a memorial sculpture at the British Embassy in Tokyo.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"moral case blanket lockdown fading fast","story":"The argument for a lockdown was overwhelming. When Boris Johnson addressed the nation eight weeks ago, it appeared as if a killer virus was about to engulf the population at astonishing speed. You had to be mad or bad, it seemed, not to back the Prime Minister as he urged us all to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. The moral justification for collective action was crystal clear. “Squashing the sombrero,” as Johnson colourfully put it, was needed to buy time for the NHS to fight this thing. And we did it. Britain achieved that aim.Critical care capacity was rapidly ramped up thanks to the heroic efforts of those who built the new Nightingale hospitals, as well as the decision to cancel treatments for non-Covid cases. At the same time, the numbers being struck down by the disease began to fall – perhaps due to social distancing, or maybe just because pandemics have a habit of dissipating almost as fast as they appear. Whatever the reasons, we avoided the nightmare scenario of not being able to treat thousands of critically ill people, as happened in parts of Italy.Eight weeks on, it is also clear that some of the initial restrictions were unnecessary. The moral imperative to act overwhelmed common sense. Almost as soon as the Prime Minister announced the lockdown, my local council in west London decided to shut all the parks. Someone went to great lengths to cover every bench on Wimbledon Common in red tape. Tennis and golf, two of the most socially distanced sports imaginable, were forbidden. For a few weeks, it seemed that one was only allowed outdoors if one kept moving and was careful not to give the impression of having any kind of fun.If some of the lockdown measures were neither proportionate nor, it turns out, supported by any science, it’s worth asking if those still in place are. Much of the moral justification for keeping people locked up in their homes has started to fray.Today it is estimated that in London, a city of some 8 million people, only a couple of dozen will be infected with Covid-19. Of this small number of new infections, many won’t even fall ill. Of those who do, a few might become critically ill, and an even smaller number might die. Is it right to continue to insist that blanket lockdown measures introduced in an emergency must stay in place when Covid today is now infecting only a handful of people each day?“But,” you insist, “it’s thanks to the lockdown that the rate of infection has fallen. If we ease up on the restrictions, we run the risk of more.” Really? That’s not the experience elsewhere. There is surprisingly little evidence, when you look at how different European countries have fared, to show that the severity of the lockdown has had much of an impact on the rate of infection at all.Two months ago, exponential change was happening in one direction – up – with the numbers being infected in London doubling every three or four days. Today, suggests Cambridge University’s MRC Biostatistics Unit, exponential change is working the other way, with the number getting the virus halving at almost the same rate. This is how pandemics have often progressed in the past, and it’s not always clear that official policy towards them has quite the effect that we afterwards imagine.“So what if the rate of infection is falling in London,” you might think. “This pandemic – or rather the first wave of it – may have passed in the capital, but it’s not like that everywhere. It continues to infect significant numbers in Scotland and the Midlands.” Indeed. Which is precisely why we need a different approach to dealing with the disease in different regions. It makes little sense to keep Londoners housebound to prevent infections from a virus that has run its course in the capital.One thing that the lockdown brought us which may turn out to be even more precious than all that (mercifully unused) critical care capacity, was knowledge about the disease. Far from being an indiscriminate killer, expanding exponentially across the population, we now know it seems to run in clusters. Certain cities – Madrid, London, New York – have been especially badly hit, as have certain social networks, such as those in and around care homes.Such insights, which we simply did not have two months ago, mean that we can now target our response to the disease, focusing our efforts on particular parts of the country, and specific settings. While London can be liberalised, we should do more to tackle the spread of the virus where it actually is.Until now, it’s been remarkably difficult for policy makers to keep track of cases. But the arrival now of a mass-produced, reliable antibody test means we will soon have a much better idea of where the virus is – and critically, where it has been.Once that happens, the moral case for blanket measures disappears. Those in certain key “hot spots” would need to abide by strict social distancing.

But we should be prepared, if we do see start cases going back up, to close them again. “I think people should be prepared that we may see a number of these things changing over the coming weeks. We are at the very early stages of this relaxation.”He added: “I have two children in Year One and one in Year Five, so it is particularly relevant to me. “As an epidemiologist, if all I was interested in was minimising risk to health then we would never advise that any lockdown should be lifted because any relaxation of lockdown will clearly contribute to an increased risk. That is the bottom line. “But there are other factors in play. We can’t stay in full lockdown until we have a vaccine so there needs to be some measured relaxation and we can see that risk to school children is very low. As a parent thinking of inidual risk to a child, I would say a staggered return is safe.”On Friday, a meeting between the NASUWT teachers\u0027 union and the Government’s chief scientific advisers resulted in further fallout over the plan to slowly start opening classrooms again. Its general secretary, Patrick Roach, heads said the talks raised more questions than answers and claimed No. 10 provided no information to change the widely held view that the evidence base for opening schools from 1 June is weak.He said the union “remains clear that no school should reopen until it can demonstrate that it is safe to do so”.No clear information was provided on what modelling has been undertaken in relation to potential transmission rates when schools open more widely. Nothing in the meeting provided reassurance for the deeply worried and anxious school workforce.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second wave coronavirus europe winter uk","story":"European countries should brace themselves for a deadly second wave of coronavirus infections because the pandemic is not over, the World Health Organisation’s top official in Europe has said. In an exclusive interview with The , Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, delivered a stark warning to countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions, saying that now is the time for preparation, not celebration.Dr Kluge stressed that, as the number of cases of Covid-19 in countries such as the UK, France and Italy was beginning to fall, it did not mean the pandemic was coming to an end. The epicentre of the European outbreak is now in the east, with the number of cases rising in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, he warned. Countries should use this time wisely and start to strengthen public health systems as well as building capacity in hospitals, primary care and intensive care units, he said. Singapore and Japan understood early on that this is not a time for celebration, it\u0027s a time for preparation. That\u0027s what Scandinavian countries are doing – they don\u0027t exclude a second wave, but they hope it will be localised and they can jump on it quickly,” said Dr Kluge.He also warned that a second wave could coincide with an outbreak of other infectious diseases.“I’m very concerned about a double wave – in the fall, we could have a second wave of Covid and another one of seasonal flu or measles. Two years ago we had 500,000 children who didn\u0027t have their first shot of the measles vaccine, he said. Many experts, including England\u0027s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, have warned that a second wave of the pandemic could be even deadlier than the first, pointing to the 1918-20 Spanish flu pandemic as evidence. When the Spanish flu first emerged in March 1918, it had the hallmarks of the typical seasonal illness – but it then came back in an even more virulent and deadly form in the autumn, eventually killing an estimated 50 million people.Troop movements at the end of the First World War are thought to have accelerated the spread of the disease, which also had a third and fourth wave although these were not as devastating.We know from history that in pandemics the countries that have not been hit early on can be hit in a second wave, said Dr Kluge. What are we going to see in Africa and Eastern Europe? They\u0027re behind the curve – some countries are saying: \u0027We\u0027re not like Italy\u0027 and then, two weeks later, boom! They can unfortunately get hit by a second wave, so we have to be very very careful.In the last couple of weeks, many European countries have started unlocking their shuttered economies and allowing some resumption of normal life.Earlier this month, the Spanish population was allowed to exercise outside for the first time in seven weeks, and restaurants in some areas of Germany have reopened. In France, people will no longer need travel permits to explain why they have left home.But in the absence of an effective treatment for the virus, or a vaccine, Dr Kluge said any lockdown had to be accompanied by rigorous public health measures including comprehensive contact tracing and testing. A pilot NHS contact tracing app was launched on the Isle of Wight last week, with the Government saying it would be rolled out to the rest of the country by the end of the month if it proves successful.The number of tests being carried out has been growing slowly but is still not at the 100,000-a day-level promised by Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary. Analysis by the  shows that around 80,000 tests a day are being carried out. Dr Kluge said the lack of a treatment or vaccine meant any easing of lockdown restrictions had to be done gradually and carefully, adding: People think lockdown is finished. Nothing has changed. The full disease control package has to be in place. That\u0027s the key message. He said that he hoped the pandemic had shown that health should now be at the top of the political agenda.We always thought that health was the driver of economic prosperity, but it\u0027s worse – where there\u0027s no health, there’s no economy, he added. This is a lesson that cannot be forgotten. Public health deserves its place at the top of the agenda. And sometimes when a leader has suffered personally, it helps, he added.  Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/07/15/blackhurst-canary-wharf-london.jpg","title":"coronavirus global economy impact gdp covid 19","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Containing spread of virus key to limiting economic damage, says Asian Development BankCoronavirus could cut global economic output by as much as $8.8 trillion (£7.3 trillion), with the outlook having worsened significantly in the past month, the Asian Development Bank has said.The bank warned on Friday that Covid-19 would result in $5.8 trillion to $8.8 trillion of lost gross domestic product ⁠– or 6.4 per cent to 9.7 per cent of the world’s output. That’s more than twice as bad as the ADB forecast in April.However, government measures to mitigate the economic impact could reduce that figure by as much as 40 per cent, ADB’s chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs some countries, including the UK, lay out plans to ease lockdowns and get more people back to work, Mr Sawada cautioned that containing the pandemic is key to reducing the economic cost. Testing, tracing, isolation, effective social distancing, and securing protective and medical equipment are all “essential elements” of containing Covid-19, he said. Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?He also pointed to the importance of government support for struggling families and businesses to lessen the adverse effects of the pandemic and to avoid long-term consequences for growth and development.“Rapid and effective containment will allow for a faster recovery,” he said. “Then, it is critical to identify industries and occupations in terms of essentiality and economic importance, and their ability to operate safely with adequate social distancing.“Finally, governments should reopen the economy sequentially, balancing health risks and economic considerations, and being ready to tighten if outbreaks reoccur. For all of this, having adequate data and information is key.”His words came as the UK government faced criticism from scientists over its easing of lockdown restrictions this week.The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned on Tuesday that the UK faces “inevitable” future lockdowns if the government implements its “potentially dangerous” coronavirus strategy.Ministers laid out plans this week to get sectors including construction and manufacturing back to work, and to restart the housing market.However, the government was accused of confusing people with it’s new message to “stay alert”, replacing a previous instruction to “stay at home”.The number of deaths in the UK has fallen in recent days but the Independent Sage, an alternative to the government’s official scientific advisory panel, said numbers of infections were still too high to implement an effective policy of tracking, tracing and isolating cases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More than 40 per cent of those surveyed said sale prices could drop by more than 4 per cent this year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPredictions on house prices vary wildly thanks to huge uncertainty about the economic impact of the virus. A forecast by the Centre for Economics and Business Research was more gloomy, pointing to an estimated 13 per cent drop in average house prices.It came as the government announced plans this week to reopen the housing market, which has ground to a halt during the pandemic thanks to a ban on almost all home moves. That meant around £82bn of sales had stalled, according to property website Zoopla.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Other measures aimed at helping homeowners attracted criticism on Thursday as it emerged that taking a payment holiday on mortgages or other forms of debt could affect someone’s ability to borrow money in future.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) told lenders to help people struggling financially during the pandemic by temporarily halting payments on credit cards, personal loans and mortgages for up to three months.Borrowers had been told this would not affect their credit score, but MoneySavingExpert highlighted on Thursday that some lenders take other factors into account when deciding whether to grant borrowing.Interest still builds up during a payment holiday, leaving borrowers with a larger bill to pay afterwards.The number of mortgages in arrears increased slightly in the first three months of the year, figures from trade body UK Finance showed.Some 72,380 homeowner mortgages were behind by more than 2.5 per cent of the outstanding balance, compared to 70,880 in the fourth quarter of 2019, figures from UK Finance show.That number is expected to rise in the second quarter as households begin to feel the impact of Covid-19 on their finances.The FCA announced on Thursday that insurance customers will be able to request payment holidays from next week.

He also spits a furball into Ray Winstone’s face.But it\u0027s Corden’s ad-libbing during the song “Bustopher Jones” that the musical’s original composer Andrew Lloyd Webber appears to have a problem with.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn a new commentary on the 1998 version of the musical, as “Bustopher Jones” begins to play, Webber says: “Do not be beguiled by other versions – other versions with unfunny interpolations which I begged to be cut out.”He continues: “This song is about wit not coarse jokes. It’s also about taking the song at the right speed.”The Thick of It cast and creators reflect on the sitcom as it turns 15The best fake movies in film and television, rankedJudi Dench says she looked ‘battered’ and ‘mangy’ Cats filmIn the scene, Jones can be seen bouncing around the set on a giant seesaw.

That’s more than twice as bad as the ADB forecast in April.However, government measures to mitigate the economic impact could reduce that figure by as much as 40 per cent, ADB’s chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs some countries, including the UK, lay out plans to ease lockdowns and get more people back to work, Mr Sawada cautioned that containing the pandemic is key to reducing the economic cost. Testing, tracing, isolation, effective social distancing, and securing protective and medical equipment are all “essential elements” of containing Covid-19, he said. Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?He also pointed to the importance of government support for struggling families and businesses to lessen the adverse effects of the pandemic and to avoid long-term consequences for growth and development.“Rapid and effective containment will allow for a faster recovery,” he said. “Then, it is critical to identify industries and occupations in terms of essentiality and economic importance, and their ability to operate safely with adequate social distancing.“Finally, governments should reopen the economy sequentially, balancing health risks and economic considerations, and being ready to tighten if outbreaks reoccur. For all of this, having adequate data and information is key.”His words came as the UK government faced criticism from scientists over its easing of lockdown restrictions this week.The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned on Tuesday that the UK faces “inevitable” future lockdowns if the government implements its “potentially dangerous” coronavirus strategy.Ministers laid out plans this week to get sectors including construction and manufacturing back to work, and to restart the housing market.However, the government was accused of confusing people with it’s new message to “stay alert”, replacing a previous instruction to “stay at home”.The number of deaths in the UK has fallen in recent days but the Independent Sage, an alternative to the government’s official scientific advisory panel, said numbers of infections were still too high to implement an effective policy of tracking, tracing and isolating cases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More than 40 per cent of those surveyed said sale prices could drop by more than 4 per cent this year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPredictions on house prices vary wildly thanks to huge uncertainty about the economic impact of the virus. A forecast by the Centre for Economics and Business Research was more gloomy, pointing to an estimated 13 per cent drop in average house prices.It came as the government announced plans this week to reopen the housing market, which has ground to a halt during the pandemic thanks to a ban on almost all home moves. That meant around £82bn of sales had stalled, according to property website Zoopla.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Other measures aimed at helping homeowners attracted criticism on Thursday as it emerged that taking a payment holiday on mortgages or other forms of debt could affect someone’s ability to borrow money in future.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) told lenders to help people struggling financially during the pandemic by temporarily halting payments on credit cards, personal loans and mortgages for up to three months.Borrowers had been told this would not affect their credit score, but MoneySavingExpert highlighted on Thursday that some lenders take other factors into account when deciding whether to grant borrowing.Interest still builds up during a payment holiday, leaving borrowers with a larger bill to pay afterwards.The number of mortgages in arrears increased slightly in the first three months of the year, figures from trade body UK Finance showed.Some 72,380 homeowner mortgages were behind by more than 2.5 per cent of the outstanding balance, compared to 70,880 in the fourth quarter of 2019, figures from UK Finance show.That number is expected to rise in the second quarter as households begin to feel the impact of Covid-19 on their finances.The FCA announced on Thursday that insurance customers will be able to request payment holidays from next week. Some may also be able to move onto a cheaper deal or get a partial refund of the cost of their policy.The measures will come into force on Monday 18 May and be reviewed in the next three months.

The comments came after a CNBC report that said multiple anonymous AI researchers said they saw Musk’s views on the technology as inappropriate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAn AI executive speaking to CNBC, who asked to remain anonymous because their company may work for one of Musk’s businesses, said that “A large proportion of the community think he’s a negative distraction.”He is sensationalist, he veers wildly between openly worrying about the downside risk of the technology and then hyping the AGI (artificial general intelligence) agenda. Whilst his very real accomplishments are acknowledged, his loose remarks lead to the general public having an unrealistic understanding of the state of AI maturity.”It’s time to draw the curtain on celebrity businessmen like Musk“AGI” stands for “artificial general intelligence,” which is the hypothetical benchmark whereby a machine can learn anything that a human being could. This is distinct from \u0027standard\u0027 artificial intelligence, which is when a machine is capable of carrying out a task like a human could, such as voice recognition in Siri or Alexa.Another specialised focused on speech recognition said that Musk is “not always looked upon favourably,” while an AI researcher at a UK university said that they “instinctively fall on dislike, because he makes up such nonsense.”“But then he delivers such extraordinary things. It always leaves me wondering, does he know what he’s doing? Is all the visionary stuff just a trick to get an innovative thing to market?” they continued.On Twitter, Pesenti said that many people in the AI community would be happy to criticise Musk publicly, stating that Musk “has no idea what he is talking about when he talks about AI. There is no such thing as AGI and we are nowhere near matching human intelligence.”While Facebook team declined to give an official comment, Pesenti said that it was his “personal opinion” but that others at the company – including Yann LeCun, a professor at New York University and a Chief AI Scientist at Facebook and Edward Grefenstette, a Facebook AI Research Scientist – agreed.LeCun quote-tweeted Musk’s disparaging comment, saying that Tesla’s engineers still needed access to Facebook’s PyTorch to develop their products. PyTorch is a free, open source machine learning library primarily developed by Facebok’s AI Research lab.The researchers, Tesla, and SpaceX were contacted by The Independent for comment.

Puppet on a String - Sandie Shaw (Winner in Vienna, 1967) 366.5ptsOur first Eurovision victory. Sandie notoriously hated this song “from the very first oompah to the final bang on the big bass drum… I was instinctively repelled by its sexist drivel and cuckoo-clock tune” she recalls in her autobiography.510 6. Where Are You? - Imaani (Runner-up in Birmingham, 1998) 366.7ptsIf there’s one UK entry that deserves more recognition than it gets, it’s this. Imaani was the UK’s fifteenth and most recent runner-up. She narrowly missed out on a hometurf victory as “Where Are You?” failed to win any points when the final jury dished out their scores.610 5. Boom Bang-a-Bang - Lulu (Winner in Madrid, 1969) 367.4ptsLulu won the 14th contest in a four-way tie with France, Spain and the Netherlands – a situation which prompted Finland, Norway, Portugal and Sweden to withdraw from the following year’s contest out of protest. Such drama! Salvador Dalí designed the promotional materials for the contest as well as the stage, which explains the slightly weird metal sculpture that Lulu performed in front of.710 4. Love Shine a Light - Katrina and the Waves (Winner in Dublin, 1997) 381.1ptsIt’s been 22 long years since Katrina Leskanich brought home our last Eurovision victory, and we suspect it’ll be at least 23 years until the next.810 3. Storm - SuRie (24th in Lisbon, 2018) 381.4ptsEurovision performances can stand out for all sorts of reasons. SuRie’s time on stage is memorable not because her microphone was snatched by a stage invader, but by the way she reacted to the situation. Few other artists on this list would have handled it so deftly.910 2. Save Your Kisses for Me - Brotherhood of Man (Winner in The Hague, 1976) 381.9ptsWith a last-second plot twist to rival those in Game of Thrones, “Save Your Kisses For Me” is the highest ranking winner on our chart.1010 1. Never Give Up on You - Lucie Jones (15th in Kiev, 2017) 398.4ptsUh oh. We fully realise that some fans will race to the bottom of this list, see “Lucie Jones” at number one, slam their Union Jack mug down, open a new tab and furiously tap out a tweet about the ludicrousness of it all. 110 10.

Where Are You? - Imaani (Runner-up in Birmingham, 1998) 366.7ptsIf there’s one UK entry that deserves more recognition than it gets, it’s this. Imaani was the UK’s fifteenth and most recent runner-up. She narrowly missed out on a hometurf victory as “Where Are You?” failed to win any points when the final jury dished out their scores.610 5. Boom Bang-a-Bang - Lulu (Winner in Madrid, 1969) 367.4ptsLulu won the 14th contest in a four-way tie with France, Spain and the Netherlands – a situation which prompted Finland, Norway, Portugal and Sweden to withdraw from the following year’s contest out of protest. Such drama! Salvador Dalí designed the promotional materials for the contest as well as the stage, which explains the slightly weird metal sculpture that Lulu performed in front of.710 4. Love Shine a Light - Katrina and the Waves (Winner in Dublin, 1997) 381.1ptsIt’s been 22 long years since Katrina Leskanich brought home our last Eurovision victory, and we suspect it’ll be at least 23 years until the next.810 3. Storm - SuRie (24th in Lisbon, 2018) 381.4ptsEurovision performances can stand out for all sorts of reasons. SuRie’s time on stage is memorable not because her microphone was snatched by a stage invader, but by the way she reacted to the situation. Few other artists on this list would have handled it so deftly.910 2. Save Your Kisses for Me - Brotherhood of Man (Winner in The Hague, 1976) 381.9ptsWith a last-second plot twist to rival those in Game of Thrones, “Save Your Kisses For Me” is the highest ranking winner on our chart.1010 1. Never Give Up on You - Lucie Jones (15th in Kiev, 2017) 398.4ptsUh oh. We fully realise that some fans will race to the bottom of this list, see “Lucie Jones” at number one, slam their Union Jack mug down, open a new tab and furiously tap out a tweet about the ludicrousness of it all. When is Eurovision: Come Together on TV and what should I expect?Graham Norton is hosting Eurovision: Come Together, a one-off TV special that gives the UK a chance to vote for their favourite Eurovision performances.The choices will come from a short list of artists who will all give virtual performances on the night.

The accords are named in keeping with the Artemis programme, which is the plan to send the first woman and next man to the moon by 2024.They would include a commitment to be transparent in their work, to only explore space for “peaceful purposes”, and to guarantee they would work together to save any astronauts that came into danger during a mission.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNasa was explicit that the agreements would be made in keeping with the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which currently sets the legal framework for space exploration. That requires a set of commitments from countries which are intended to ensure that space missions are as safe and transparent as possible.But the new Artemis Accords go further than those commitments, requiring more detailed principles from the countries prepared to work with the US to head to the moon and beyond.Nasa reveals Tesla car that will drive astronauts to new launch“While Nasa is leading the Artemis programme, international partnerships will play a key role in achieving a sustainable and robust presence on the moon while preparing to conduct a historic human mission to Mars,” the agency said on its website.“With numerous countries and private sector players conducting missions and operations in cislunar space, it’s critical to establish a common set of principles to govern the civil exploration and use of outer space.”In full, the principles are that any mission should be conducted with peaceful purposes should be transparent and use technology that is interoperable and conforms to open, international standards that everyone can use. International partners also have to agree to provide emergency assistance to astronauts in trouble publicly register any space objects release the scientific data they gather protect the heritage of historic space artefacts gather resources according to international agreements not harmfully interfere with other missions and dispose of any debris or spacecraft responsibly.When drafts of the accords were leaked earlier this month, they attracted ire from Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos. He suggested on Twitter that the US was planning to invade the moon like it had Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the accords would be a way of building a coalition of other countries that would allow for it to take over the lunar surface.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Representatives also indicated that they hope for Russia to sign a version of the accords.As well as drawing criticism from Russia, the accords appear to be something of a rebuke to the Chinese space programme, which has traditionally been less transparent than the US. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine explicitly referenced the problems around its recent rocket launch as an example of where the accords could help.“The empty core stage of the Long March 5B, weighing nearly 20 tons, was in an uncontrolled free fall along a path that carried it over Los Angeles and other densely populated areas,” Mr Bridenstine told Ars Technica.“I can think of no better example of why we need the Artemis Accords. It’s vital for the US to lead and establish norms of behaviour against such irresponsible activities. Space exploration should inspire hope and wonder, not fear and danger.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s just horrible to think of it in this day and age. I’ve had help from some brilliant volunteers too. I’ve got three young girls at home and I hope they’re learning something about giving back to the community from all this.“I think The Felix Project is doing fantastic work right now. Stopping food going to waste is such a brilliant thing.”Tim Young decided last month to start volunteering with Bread n Butter: a social enterprise in Barnet getting up to 600 cooked meals and food parcels out each day, thanks to around 80 crates of produce supplied weekly by The Felix Project.The 55-year-old – who is still recovering from a heart operation he had earlier this year – has been cooking up to 150 meals a week from his own kitchen.“I’m relatively lucky, I’ve got quite a big kitchen and lots of pots and pans – so I wanted to do what I could. It’s hard to see how much people are struggling at the moment, because the level of need seems to be going up and up. But it’s a pretty good feeling being able to help others out.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The social enterprise adapted to the crisis by delivering free meals to vulnerable people’s doors and NHS hospitals.“I thought they were doing such important work, so I was delighted to lend a hand and do some of the cooking,” said Mr Young. “The Felix Project is doing amazing work too and all the food they’re supplying is fantastic. I’m so glad it isn’t going to waste.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIts warning comes as campaigners report women are being put on sick pay, annual leave, or not receiving any money whatsoever during lockdown because they are pregnant.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) called for employment safeguards for expectant mothers and new mothers to be “urgently strengthened” more broadly but also specifically in the government’s return to work guidance which is being supplied to employers. It demanded an increase of three months in the time limit for putting forward employment tribunal claims for discrimination and harassment – arguing it needs to be lengthened to half a year.

The pressures of the coronavirus crisis add to the risk of discrimination. The government has already outlined its intention to increase protection from redundancy for pregnant women and returning mothers by an additional six months – we welcome this commitment and ask that this essential protection is now implemented. As the current situation makes it much harder to make discrimination claims, the time limit should be increased as part of emergency legislation. We know employers have to make tough decisions in these circumstances, but they must be fair to those on maternity leave or who have recently given birth. If we don’t act now the hard-earned rights of women at work will be set back.”The EHRC urged the government to bolster the job retention scheme and incorporate the right for disadvantaged groups, such as disabled people, those with long-term health conditions or caring duties, to ask to be furloughed.This comes after the government’s Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme for employees was extended until the end of October by the chancellor earlier in the week. Rishi Sunak announced the furlough scheme, which sees the government foot the bill for 80 per cent of furloughed employee’s wages with a cap of £2,500 a month, would remain unchanged until the end of July.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Pregnant in a pandemic: How parents-to-be are coping with coronavirusShe added: “Last month, our free legal advice line received five times as many calls as it normally does. We’ve opened a second helpline to cope with the demand. Every day we are hearing from women placed on sick pay, annual leave, or going unpaid simply because they are pregnant. We’ve also heard of workplaces that are only furloughing pregnant women and mothers. This crisis has seen a blatant erosion of the employment rights of pregnant women and mothers.“We are preparing for a surge in employment tribunal claims when people return to work. However, it’s completely unreasonable to expect employees to bring a claim within the three-month time limit, given the circumstances. Many of these women are either coming to terms with new motherhood, trying to balance work with no childcare or simply trying to survive financially. “They don’t have the capacity to then take on legal action too. We have long campaigned for this time limit to be extended to six months, and The Law Commission has recently recommended this too. Delaying the implementation of this further will give unscrupulous employers a free pass.”The NHS states pregnant women are deemed to be a vulnerable group and need to be especially strict with social distancing.Rosalind Bragg, director of Maternity Action, a national pregnancy charity, noted the government committed to making redundancy protections for new mothers stronger back in 2017 but women are still waiting for action to be taken. Pregnant women not at greater risk of severe Covid-19, UK study finds“It is not acceptable that pregnant women will be left without the promised legal protections as businesses downsize during the pandemic,” she added. “Discrimination against pregnant women and new mothers was widespread before the pandemic, and we are very concerned that the situation will worsen as economic conditions deteriorate.”Ms Bragg continued: “On our advice lines, we are hearing from women at risk of redundancy who would benefit from the promised legal protections. There is nothing to stop the government taking swift action now to make the promised changes to the law.“We have asked the government for guidance on health and safety for pregnant women at work, and are disappointed that this is still not forthcoming. This has left many pregnant workers facing a choice between unsafe working conditions or taking badly paid sick leave, employers are unaware of their legal obligations. Pregnant women who cannot be offered safe working conditions, should be suspended on full pay or offered furlough.”A London School of Economics study, which came out earlier in the week, shows women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the upcoming recession because a greater proportion work in sectors which are predicted to be hardest hit.Women are overrepresented in hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts – industries where thousands of workers have been furloughed or laid off due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The government equalities office has been contacted for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There was an 81 per cent increase in emergency food parcels given out during the last two weeks of March compared to the same period in 2019.Warning that the enormous level of need was likely to continue, she said: “If would be false of me to say we can continue to meet indefinitely an unspecified level of increased demand.”How to support our campaignThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is seeking to raise £10m for the food surplus charity The Felix Project so it can provide food for NHS staff, the poor and elderly who are unable to afford supplies or remain stuck at home for health reasons.The Trussell Trust chief said food aid charities had done “incredible work” since the beginning of the outbreak, and said more than 50 per cent of food banks had adapted to the lockdown by doing home deliveries.However, Ms Revie argued that unless the government strengthened the financial safety net, the UK would continue to see “the kind of destitution that drives people to food banks”.She added: “The problem is people falling into financial hardship. The answer to financial hardship is not food. We are treating one symptom of an underlying problem … The issue we must be focusing on reducing the flow of people into foodbanks.”Advocating a “cash-first approach”, Ms Revie said: “If we’re identifying families in financial hardship ⁠– the most straightforward and dignified response is to provide them with the cash.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was really scary. I was an alien for a while, I could barely speak. I wasn’t sure if I would make it.”Ms Khan rang 111, who told her to wait it out at home and see if she got worse. But within days, she said she couldn’t even walk. “I felt weak and dizzy. I couldn’t move at all, I was just on the sofa, trying to remember to breathe. I thought I might be having a heart attack or a stroke. My left side felt numb.”A friend called 999 on her behalf and medics came to her home. Ms Khan said: “They checked my vitals and they were happy enough with me. My oxygen levels were OK\u0026nbspand they said it might be that I was fatigued.“They said sometimes people get another blow when they are almost over the virus and that is what probably happened to me. It felt like an exorcism.” At the peak of her illness, Ms Khan went online to seek help.

We couldn’t be prouder to donate and help them to get food to people in the most difficult situations.”Another supplier to go the extra mile is Reach Food Service, a provider of premium ingredients to London’s gourmet restaurants, which has donated £10,000.In addition it has pledged £1 for every home delivery during 2020 of its newly launched Reach My Kitchen initiative – dispensing meat, seafood and poultry ingredients normally reserved for London’s top chefs directly to households – and which it estimates will raise its total donation to £50,000.Other food-linked organisations that have already supported our appeal include The Daylesford Foundation, which donated £100,000, and Hello Fresh with £25,000.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Same with Müller – their contribution has quadrupled.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in The Independent, said: “Our Food for London Now campaign has raised £4m in just seven weeks. With more than 1,500 reader donations, and the support of London companies, we have reached heights few expected.“We have told the stories of the people who are suffering during this pandemic. The homeless, the unemployed, the isolated. And we have saluted the innovative people who have applied their skills to helping them in this crisis.“The capital has heard our call, but the hunger crisis has not peaked – just look at the grim economic news from this week.

Canines’ acute sense of smell is already used to detect certain cancers and other diseases, and it is hoped that the animals can turn their noses to helping with the ongoing pandemic. Some diseases have a distinctive odor that it not detectable to most humans but which dogs – with their strongly developed sense of smell – find obvious.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCurrent medical detection dogs working with other diseases can screen as many as 250 people per hour and can be trained to detect the odor of a disease at the equivalent dilution to one teaspoon of sugar in two Olympic-sized swimming pools of water.Professor James Logan, lead researcher for the work and Head of the Department of Disease Control at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, said he was “hopeful” that the government-backed project could bear fruit.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“Our previous work has shown that malaria has a distinctive odour, and with Medical Detection Dogs, we successfully trained dogs to accurately detect malaria. This, combined with the knowledge that respiratory disease can change body odour, makes us hopeful that the dogs can also detect Covid-19,” he said. “I would like to thank the UK government for their support of this pioneering research through this funding. We’re excited to do this trial, and confirm whether these bio detection dogs can be used to screen for COVID-19.“If successful, this approach could revolutionise how we detect the virus, with the potential to screen high numbers of people.” Covid-19 is not thought to be a health threat to dogs, though they can test positive for it.

They seem to react much better to Caravaggio than Monet. And these are Peruvian penguins, so we were speaking a bit in Spanish, and they really appreciated art history.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

across Belgium. A platform carries families to their relatives\u0027 windows. A daughter or grandson waves, and worries vanish from faces creased by age.Eve Putseys did not quite know what to expect as she was lifted up to see her 88-year-old aunt, Suzanne, at the La Cambre care home on the outskirts of Brussels.“It\u0027s been seven long weeks since I haven\u0027t been able to see her,” she said. “It\u0027s all quite emotional.”Afterward, Ms Putseys was all smiles.“I got to see her - and that was great,” she said. And on top of that “she looked very happy to see me”.The anxiety of families with relatives in nursing homes is well placed of the 8,843 confirmed and suspected cases who had died of the virus in Belgium as of Tuesday, 4,538 were in such facilities. Their families are left feeling helpless, fearing they will not see each other again.Women ‘bearing burden of childcare and homeschooling in lockdown’What the public think is socially acceptable during lockdownFears grow over impact of pandemic on young people’s mental healthLittle wonder Mr Van den Bosch had little trouble filling his platforms for this special kind of joyride.The La Cambre home prepared the facility, the families and the elderly to make sure everything went smoothly.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s just the way these people operate.”Tiger King has kept us glued to our television sets during lockdown as we marvel at the self-proclaimed “gay, gun-carrying red neck” Joe Exotic and his Oklahoma zoo.While his tiger breeding scene might seem a million miles away from our shores, there are scores of big cat owners right here in the UK.A Freedom of Information request by the Born Free charity shows that , wild animal licences have been handed out by local authorities in Britain - and the success of Tiger King is likely to encourage even more applications.Thomas lives with his girlfriend Celine Timmerman, , in rural Staffordshire and holds a licence that allows him to keep  unusual pets including foxes and snakes.He comes from a long line of animal trainers and performed in a travelling circus until  when the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsrefused to renew his licence, sparking a high profile court battle that he lost.Given that he was one of only a few big cat trainers working in a UK circus, he was dubbed ‘Britain’s Last Lion Tamer’ ahead of a nationwide ban on the acts this year.Today his male tiger Altai, aged nine, and two male African lions called Tsavo and Assegai, both , live in a  sq ft enclosure beside his house where he feeds them discarded meat from the local abattoir.“I have to work harder to keep them stimulated and provide extra enrichment now they are not performing in the circus, he says.“I put dferent toys in their enclosures, I spray perfume around and put in leafy branches and scent boxes.“I’m very attached to the animals and they are receptive to that.“I can kiss one of the lions and put my arm around him because he trusts me.The trainer has been dogged by outrage over his shows in the past, with protesters taking to the streets supported by the RSPCA and Peta.During a  tour of Wales, he was forced to deny claims the lions and tigers, which were bred in captivity, are mistreated and kept in cages which are too small.“I think they’re happy, he says today. They are in open air and have plenty of room to run around in.“I don’t see any problem with having any animals in the circus as long as their welfare needs are met.Thomas fears more clashes with protestershis untitled documentary – which is already being dubbed ‘Lion King’ on a video posted on Facebook – is snapped up by a major television station.He has already been warned by a security consultant that he might have acid thrown in his face.“I did wince a bit when I watched Tiger King and worry that it might reflect badly on people like me, but I think a lot of people have sympathy for Joe, Thomas says.“He has become a bit of a cult hero despite his shortcomings as a man.“If he ever came out of prison there would be a lot of people supporting him as well as condemning him.”Thomas says some of his earliest memories are of his animal trainer dad Tommy, now , and his animal trainer mum Marilyn Chipperfield, being targeted by welfare groups.The threats continued right up until his mother died from a respiratory disease that he fears might have been coronavirus in December last year aged .“I’ve been having issues with animal rights protesters my whole le, Thomas says.“I remember watching it happening to my parents when I was a little kid with people shouting things like, I hope you die of cancer.“Seven years ago someone rang my mum and threatened to kidnap her and you have to take these threats seriously and get the police involved.“I’ve had nasty things shouted at me and I have lost count of how many times people have broken into the grounds here at night with malicious intentions. I always chase them off.“I’ve never had anything physical with the protesters but I know people who have come to blows with men clad in balaclavas. I know one person who was slashed with a Stanley kne.“I’ve had five death threats I can think of, most of them over social media. People have threatened to shoot me, behead me and burn me alive.It is believed there are at least  wild cats being kept in private residences in the UK including servals, lynx, lions, leopards, pumas and cheetahs.Monkeys, poisonous snakes, black widow spiders, exotic lizards, wolves, alligators, bears, an elephant and a giraffe are also registered as living in houses here, according to a search of the wild animal licenses handed out.But experts fear there could be thousands more unregistered creatures hidden in British homes.In  exotic pet owner Dan Brandon was killed by the African rock python called Tiny he kept at his home in Hampshire.The -year-old died of asphyxia after the ft long creature coiled around his chest and squeezed in what the coroner believed was an act of affection.Last year another Brit called Andy Johnson, , revealed just how close he came to being seriously injured by Cuddles, one of the  pet crocodiles he keeps in a converted shed in Cambridgeshire.“Cuddles isn’t that cuddly,” he said. “She took my fingers a few weeks ago.“Her tooth went straight through my thumb nail and she took a chunk out of this finger. If she’d bitten my wrist, she’d have had my hand clean off.”Born Free is calling for a review of the legislation covering the keeping of wild animals as pets, including the Dangerous Wild Animals Act .Dr Chris Draper, head of animal welfare and captivity at the charity, says: “The keeping of wild animals as pets is a growing concern.“The widespread use of the internet has made it easier than ever to ‘order’ or purchase a wild animal without clarication as to where it has come from or how it should be cared for.”Former human resources executive Christine Courtney is another British big cat enthusiast.Three years ago she quit her high-flying City job to fulfil her dream of breeding wild animals in her hometown of Salcombe in Devon.Christine currently owns  exotic cats including ious generations of savannah and two servals called Orley and Ozzy.She can sell ‘higher generation’ kittens for up to £, a time through her Amare Cats company.Servals can leap ft in the air and reach speeds of mph.Christine keeps hers in a  square metre enclosure and feeds them dead prey and raw meat bought from her local supermarket.She warns people not to make snap purchases after viewing cute pictures of the felines on social media sites like Instagram.The mum-of-one, , tells Sun Online: “It’s time-consuming looking after my cats because they need a lot of attention, but it is also hugely rewarding.“Servals are elegant creatures and are about the size of a medium dog, so they are more manageable than bigger cats like a Lynx or a tiger.“But they are also high energy and can be destructiveyou try to keep them inside the house.“They are not going to spend all day sitting in your windowsill like a domestic cat and while you can walk them with a harness, you definitely cannot let them off the lead outside of their enclosure.“Servals need lots of attention, socialising and care or they will revert to what they are like in the wild.“I have heard of exotic cat owners who cannot even step foot in their enclosures because the animals are too unpredictable.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government cannot afford to repeat such a shambles.“Stay home, save lives” was a simple and effective message. The next steps are far more nuanced.They did not need another vague Churchillian rallying call. That merely sowed confusion, even among the PM’s deputy Dominic Raab and the staunchest Tories, and exposed Boris to a tsunami of snark on TV and social media.It needed instead the level of detail we eventually saw in the Government’s guidance released yesterday afternoon — and then in Boris’s Commons QA.Supporters claimed the PM’s new “stay alert” message was merely common sense any fool could grasp. That misses the point. We are being asked to live in highly unusual and restrictive ways. One person’s common sense is another’s idea of dangerous risk.Our circumstances are all dferent and specics are important — especially when police are to hand out increased fines for transgressions.But while the Government’s recent messaging has been poor, we at least now have our first welcome, albeit ­tentative, steps out of this nightmare:Outside exercise without limit, including the freedom to drive for a day out. The first chance in weeks to see a friend. All assuming social distancing.More solid guidance on masks. Precious little relief on schools, but the glimmer of some sport. Some, many Sun readers included, are being told toto work, though they may justiably fear it is unsafe.Their jobs also make them some of those most likely to die from Covid-.Their firms, factories and sites must bust a gut to ensure their safety, take every precaution and heed reasonable concerns. The grim reality, though, is that our economy must get moving again.It is typical of the infantile Left to complain that profits are being put before people. The Government is not a bottomless well of money. That’s why Rishi Sunak is limbering up to cut the sums paid to furloughed staff. He has to.Only a healthy economy and the taxes it generates can keep public services afloat, the NHS especially.Bankrupt Britain with an endless lockdown and you wreck those too. And far more lives are then lost.DONALD Trump is now harbouring an international fugitive.His case for refusing Britain’s request to extradite Harry Dunn’s alleged killer Anne Sacoolas is blown apart.The Interpol Red Notice, ordering her arrest outside the US, shows the “diplomatic immunity” under which she left the UK after the death crash was bogus.Even the US public want her to face the music.

All you need is a TV and the inclination.But while many will have used this virtual house arrest to shake off some unhealthy old habits , the reaction to Adele’s weight loss suggests that, for some, her transformation is a betrayal of everything fat activists hold dear.Of the , largely positive comments about the star losing an incredible seven stone, some sniped that she looked “unhealthy”and questioned how she lost it — the inference being that she had succumbed to having a gastric band.But as Pete Geracimo, her former personal trainer, points out: “It was never about getting super-skinny. It was about getting her healthy.”Not least, one suspects, for the benefit of her seven-year-old son Angelo. He adds: “She embraced better eating habits and committed to her fitness and ‘is sweating!’ I could not be prouder or happier for her.”Hear hear. Yet alarmingly, research out earlier this year found that millions of women hid their efforts to slim for fear of being mocked or labelled “anti-feminist”.Saints preserve us. The truth, of course, is thatsomeone is deeply insecure about their own weight, they either pooh-pooh or, worse, lash out at the efforts of those who manage to transform their lestyle via willpower and hard slog.Far easier to do that than take a look at our own bad habits and attempt to change them. True, there are plenty of people who look overweight but are physically fit.And there are plenty of skinny malinkies who can’t run for a bus without needing oxygen. At the end of the day, being happy within yourself is not about how you look, but how you feel.Andyou feel that you are unfit thanks to lousy eating habits and lack of exercise, then you should be able to do something about it without being taken to task by those who don’t have the same self-discipline.Particularly as last week’s research from the University of Liverpool found that obesity increased the risk of dying from coronavirus by  per cent. You can’t argue with that.BOREDOM at Moore Towers has reached such a crisis point that, on Sunday, I linked my iPhone to our portable speaker, put the songs on Shuffle and said we had to endure enjoy whatever track came up.At first there were plenty of goodies from Floyd, Bowie, Prefab Sprout and Talk Talk, but then Twinkle Twinkle Little Star popped up, followed by You Spin Me Round by . . . Alvin And The Chipmunks.For the record, our youngest is now . It seems it’s not just the kitchen cupboards that need a clear-out.BRINGING million people out of lockdown was never going to be easy.But Boris’s much-trumpeted grand statement was a damp squib that’s left us as confused as Adam and Eve on Mother’s Day.In a nutshell, four-year-olds will be able go to school with lots of kids they’re not related to but not see other kids in their family, we can go to work with colleagues but not have a chat with them in their garden, we can do unlimited exercise which we could have done anyway,we go abroad we have to self-isolate for a fortnight . . . unless it’s France, and you can drive to other destinations but not too far, whatever that means.As for “stay alert”, is that the same as Police  presenter Shaw Taylor’s old mantra of: “Keep ’em peeled ”Except we could actually see someone coming at us with a crowbar.A virus that can fit squillion times on to the head of a pin might prove harder to spot.GIVEN that the use of face masks is being actively encouraged but not the professional ones needed by key workers, a number of DIY versions are being suggested.Some involve an element of seamstress skills, but for those who want a quick and effective mask they can drum up with the minimum effort, this is my favourite.Loop a child’s hair tieover each end until it resembles a boiled sweet, then fold over the ends to meet in the middle .Then simply place the wrong side against your face, loop the hair ties around your ears, and voila.You’re welcome.FASHION designer Freya Edmondson – daughter of Ab Fab star Jenner Saunders and actor Ade Edmondson – has posted this photo of herself doing a “sumptuous, heart-opening backbend”, while writing on a notepad.Freya, who teaches free online yoga courses, is just  and, therefore, wonderfully flexible.As a former enthusiastic gymnast, it reminds me of my youth, when I would watch TV while doing the box splits – with my legs stretched out at right angles to my body.With my th birthday looming this Sunday,I attempted it now it would take four paramedics and a system of pulleys to get me on my feet again.ACADEMICS may lord it over the rest of us when it comes to quadratic equations, subatomic phenomena or the three components of the epidemiological triangle, but when it comes to common sense they are often found lacking.Quite how “Professor Lockdown” Neil Ferguson thought he could preach to the rest of us about social distancing while inviting his mistress to his house is anyone’s guess, but he did, and now he’s rightly had to resign for hypocrisynothing .He says: “I accept I made an error . . . I thought I was immune.”From Covid- . . . or criticism THE latest series of Killing Eve may have had a lukewarm reception from critics, but central character Villanelle’s fashion choices have been attracting a lot of attention.One frock cost £,, another £,, and her red leather catsuit would set you back an eye-watering £,.I know these are desperate times for all businesses, but since when have fashionistas been clamouring to get their clothes on the back of a psychotic murderer It gives a whole new meaning to “dressed to kill”.HAIRDRESSERS are to stay closed until July  at the earliest.Up to now I have been making do with the occasional fringe cut using a pair of nail scissors.But given that my “style”is supposed to be choppy bob, and I now resemble Richard lll, it seems I will have to tackle the rest of it too.Worse, The Bloke will have to do the back and, God forbid, baldlygo where no man has gone before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I’ll admit, I didn’t correct the ­lawyer .But there’s a darker side to it. A generation of young city dwellers who know nothing about Britain were always bound to underestimate our four great nations.And so they did in the  referendum.The overlap between London and the Remain campaign has been well documented —  per cent of the capital voted in favour of remaining in the EU.Among London’s student population, the depth of ­support for the EU was overwhelming.And with some ultra-liberal friends, there were moments when it would have seemed easier to come out as a ­paedophile than a Brexiteer.Of course, ardent young Remainers convinced themselves that their love of the European Union was borne out of a sophisticated appreciation of all things global.But it seems more likely to me that they saw the EU as the ­saviour to a backwards, grisly country they imagined in their ignorance to be Britain.This summer, that ignorance could finally be shattered.Thanks to Covid-, the nation’s young people won’t have the option of scurrying to ­Heathrow the second their uni exams are over.Instead —they want holidays at all — they’ll be minibreaking in Manchester or camping in the English countryside.Yes, they might turn their noses up at rolling hills, stunning architecture and incredible free museums.But I have a sneaking suspicion they’ll be surprised and impressed with what they find beyond the confines of the M.And, reconnected to their roots at last, they might just begin to feel the first stirrings of patriotism running through their British veins.When the Government published its new guidelines for lockdown in England, I – like the rest of Twitter – found myself getting very worked up about whether or not I’m allowed to play tennis with someone outside of my household.The problem, as my mum gently reminded me, is that in my case it’s a bit of a moot point: I’ve never played tennis before and I’m not entirely sure how to hold a racket.I doubt either my housemate or my friends will be begging for a game any time soon.IT’S not often I find myself welling up at the radio. But LBC caller Liz, from Witham, Essex, got me in the gut this week.Through uncontrollable tears, she explained thatcoronavirus didn’t kill her, being forbidden from touching her grand-children surely would.She’s not alone. After nearly two gruelling months of lockdown, millions of us are experiencing real, gut-wrenching loneliness.They don’t like to complain – they know their suffering is dwarfed by that of frontline health and care staffers. But starved of the company of those they love, they are withering like plants out of sunshine.You’d expect a Conservative government instinctively to get this. For generations, Tory MPs have told us that family is crucially important to the ing of the UK.They’ve thrown their weight behind policies designed to strengthen families and made many moving speeches about how a family unit is more than the sum of its parts.But it seems all that was just for show. For in their admirable haste to propel Brits back to work, this Government seems to have forgotten about families altogether.Boris Johnson’s Sunday night speech – stuffed full of specic advice for workers – didn’t have a single word of hope for single adult relatives craving each other’s company.And the millions of young adults longing to know when they can next hug Mum will have been bitterly disappointed.Of course, the PM is right to say we need to get the economy going again.Forecasts from the Treasury on the upcoming recession could hardly be more alarming – and despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, millions of businesses will go bustthey can’t get up and running again soon.Butwe’re expected to get up close with colleagues for the sake of the economy, surely we should get to see those we love best for the sake of our mental health The people of Britain are humans, not cash cows. Andthey are to get through this long, draining war in one piece, they need the support of the people they love.LISTENING to BBC News anchor Fiona Bruce casually describe carers as “low-skilled workers” really set my teeth on edge.To the shame of this nation, care home staff are indeed low paid.But low skilled  I reckon plenty of them would be more than capable of reading the news from an autocue for £, a year.And I’d like to see cofed Fiona feed, clean and comfort a newly widowed dementia sufferer without losing her cool.FOR the best part of the past decade, bespectacled “experts” gravely predicted that online dating would kill romance.Apps – they told us – would transform the dating scene into an endless virtual marketplace where singles could shop for each other , or  would turn dating into a minimal-effort pursuit of on-demand hook ups .How wrong they were.Rather than bonking their way round new digital acquaintances, millennial Brits in the st Century spend their downtime uploading photos and biographies to their smartphones and earnestly looking for love.And my, do they succeed.Last year a whopping  per cent of newly married couples met online, and Hinge – the dating app geared towards lelong relationships – is gaining users faster than any of its competitors.Granted, these apps aren’t perfect.We all like a good romance story, and Dad messaging Mum with a winky face because he liked her bikini selfie is hardly the stuff of Hollywood.But now that flirting in the pub is a thing of the past, let’s thank our lucky stars that the country’s poor singles have a shot at love at all.Rather than sitting on the sofa twiddling their thumbs, furloughed folk have been busy sculpting, chiselling and painting – and selling the fruits of their labours online.These plucky, small-time entrepreneurs are the very best of Britain.And with them around, I have no doubt this country will be back on its feet in no time.I’M absolutely loving Normal People on BBC.The chemistry between Marianneand Connellis really quite something.And as an ode to young love, the whole thing is pitch-perfect.In fact, my only quibble is why on earth are all the characters so darn sophisticated They’re , for goodness sake.Let’s see fewer candle-lit, red wine-soaked dinner parties and more tins of warm Foster’s. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It seems to spare children in almost every case.The guidance says that shielded kids who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable with multiple at risk health conditions should continue to learn from home.It said: We do not expect these children to be attending school or college, and they should continue to be supported at home as much as possible.If parents have a shielded or very vulnerable person in the home they should only go inthey can stay m apart from other staff and children.The Department for Education also stressed that kids should be encouraged to minimise contact with other iniduals as much as possible.Children should be told to wash their hands more often and make sure they know the catch it, kill it, bin it phases well.After school the classrooms should be deep cleaned using detergents and bleach.The rules suggest that schools should be ided into small bubbles with a maximum of  in each class.Anyone who develops coronavirus symptoms should order a test immediately, and the remainder of the bubble should isolate for a weekthe result is positive.When schools go back, any staff member or pupil will be eligible for a testthey need one.But the guidance doesnt say that PPE or masks will be necessary in schools.And it says the UK is is in line with other countries across Europe, who have begun to bring pre-school and school-age children back in a phased way and are focusing on primary schools and younger children.Kids in Denmark, France and other countries around the world have gone back into their classrooms in the past few weeks.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fears are mounting that Boris Johnson - who wants primary schools to begin opening their gates from June  - has moved too quickly with measures this week to ease the coronavirus lockdown in England. A meeting on Friday between teaching unions and Government scientic advisers intended to reassure staff that it was safe to go back to the classroom - but it ended inconclusively. Union representatives said they had been left with more questions than answers, with one union leader describing the scientic evidence as flimsy at best. They were backed by the British Medical Association which said schools should not reopen until the numbers of coronavirus cases were much lower. But Anne Longfield, the childrenaposs commissioner for England, said many children were struggling away from the classroom and the lack of education would impact on future le chances. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here She insisted the decision by ministers to start bringing back primary pupils was sensible and said there should be an aspiration to get all children back in school before the summer. She pointed to data suggesting NHS nurseries that have remained open during the lockdown had not suffered coronavirus outbreaks as evidence it could be done safely. All sides need to show a greater will to work together in the interests of children, she said. We cannot afford to wait for a vaccine, which may never arrive, before children are back in school. Itaposs time to stop squabbling and agree a staggered, safethat is accompanied by rigorous testing of teachers, children and families.  With another weekend of fine weather expected, there are concerns in some rural communities that the relaxation of restrictions on movement would see an influx of visitors bringing the risk of new infection. Concerns about Mr Johnsonaposs decision to begin easing the lockdown in England were heightened by the disclosure that the R number - measuring the transmission rate of the virus - has edged up. The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciessaid the latest data suggested R in England was between . and . - compared to a previous estimate of . to ..  Speaking at the daily No  press conference, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was a lag in the figures and that they were confident it remained below one. Officials have said thatit goes above one, there is a danger the outbreak will take off again with an exponential rise in the number of new cases. The latest rise in R is thought to be driven by the virus spreading in care homes and hospitals rather than the wider community.  However, some civic leaders in northern England, including Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, have voiced concerns it is still spreading more quickly in their areas and it was too soon for any easing. In Liverpool, the city council confirmed that it would continue to allow only the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils to attend school from June . The deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, insisted the risks were low with just two or three out of , of the population currently thought to be infected.

Fielding questions from the  committee of backbench Tories yesterday, the Prime Minister rejected the idea of a pay freeze for NHS workers, the Dailyreports. When he was askedhe would consider the measure, he is said to have replied: Absolutely not. Anyone who suggests that can sit on it. Addressing the influential group of around  MPs, the PM is also understood to have committed to bankrolling new transport projects in the north of England. Speaking on a conference call, he said the Government is gearing up to spend vast sums on infrastructure as the UK emerges from lockdown measures, the paper adds. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog hereSaying his approach was unlike any other Conservative government, he told colleagues: We are going to make sure we level up right across the country and keep faith with the people who voted for us. Treasury assessments put the cost of dealing with the coronavirus crisis at more than £ billion. Best case scenario forecasts suggest that the countryaposs budget deficit this year could hit £ billion, more than six times the £ billion predicted in the March budget. Leaked documents have previously suggested that increases to income tax, an end to the triple lock on state pensions and a public sector pay freeze may need to be considered to make up for the shortfall. Mr Johnson also reportedly spoke to the committee about his strategy for avoiding a second wave of coronavirus cases, saying: We mustnapost let the mugger get back off the floor, and weaposre going to play Whack-a-Mole across the country wherever coronavirus flares up.

Teaching unions warned the government’s evidence that reopening schools was safe from June  was “flimsy at best”. Liverpool ordered its schools not to open. And Gateshead Council leader Martin Gannon fumed: The national advice telling us the lockdown is over is frankly madness. Opening schools was meant to happen as part of the second phase of easing the lockdown, at the same pace across the UK. But Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all broken ranks and refused to reopen schools as soon as June . Meanwhile, the government has shown signs that dferent regions of England could end up taking dferent approaches. So what will open where and why is there such a big row  Hereaposs the issue explained. When will schools reopen in England  The plan is for primary schools to start reopening in a phased way as early as June . They would begin with years R,  and  ing in the first week of June, followed by years , ,  and  before the beginning of July. Schools are being told to halve class sizes to , prevent those mini-classes mixing with any other classes, and implement one-way corridors, staggered break and start times and extra cleaning. Secondary schools are largely not expected back before the summer break. The exception is Years  and , who would get some face-to-face time to help transition to the next year. Exams are cancelled. Ministers have said there are no plans to keep schools open during the summer holidays. Will that apply to the whole of England  Thataposs what the plan says, but we donapost know. Thereaposs a massive row brewingabout whether it will be safe to allow pupils back to school. Liverpoolaposs leaders ordered schools to defy the government and refuse to open from June . We donapost know what will happen to those who stage an outright rebellion. The Mirror asked Health Secretary Matt Hancock what will happen to rebel heads, but he didnapost give a clear answer. All we do know is inidual children wonapost be forced to go to school and there will be no fines for absence. However, the government could also decide itself to ease the lockdown at dferent speeds in dferent parts of England. Ministers had hoped the whole of the UK might move at the same speed. But modelling suggests R - the rate of transmission - ies massively across England. It was as high as . in the north east and Yorkshire - compared to . in London. Scotland and Wales also already have dferent approaches . And No now says lockdown may be eased in some areas slower than others. Itaposs not known yetthataposll include schools. When will schools reopen in Wales   First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed schools wonapost reopen on June . He said we would like to bring back some children, particularly Year , before the summer holidays. However, unlike in England thereaposs no date. Walesapos apostraffic lightapos plan to ease lockdown would see only priority groupsto school, in a phased way, at the Amber stage. Only at the Green stage would all children be able to access education and all children able to access childcare. Neither of these phases has a date yet. When will schools reopen in Scotland   Scotlandaposs First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says anyfor schools before the summer break will be very limited. She added: There will be no cavalier approach to any aspect of this on the part of the Scottish Government. There is no confirmed date, but Ms Sturgeon said yesterday that the Scottish government is trying to forge a consensus on the way forward. When will schools reopen in Northern Ireland  First Minister Arlene Foster previously said schools would likely remain closed into the summer. Last week ministers said there is still no planned date for them to reopen. Why are teachers and unions so worried  The government insists it will not send any child back to school without being sure it is safe. But worried parents, staff and unions warn it can never be completely safe when other groups in society are being told to stay at home. To prove this, the government accepts there are some trade-offs somewhere down the line. The governmentaposs own guidance accepts children in a class of  will not all be able to keep two metres apart, especiallytheyaposre young. Instead, those -strong groups will effectively act as a bubble whereone child gets Covid-, the rest must go into self-isolation. Then thereaposs the issue of protective equipment . People are being advised to wear a face covering in enclosed, non-socially distanced spaces like public transport. Yet teachers are not. Teachers will only need to wear PPE when caring for a child suspected to have coronavirus. Meanwhile, ministers are open about having to balance the risk to children from being at school, and the risk to them from not being at school. With so many children in unstable or damaging households, they could be dealt lelong damage for every month they slip behind their peers. Can children pass on coronavirus  For the moment, we have to assume they do. Some studies suggest younger children may transmit the virus less than adults. But this evidence is mixed and provides a low degree of confidence at best”, the government says. Can children get infected and sick  Yes. Government scientists believe younger children - aged up to  or  - might be less susceptible to getting infected with coronavirus. But they warn the “degree of confidence is low” - meaning they can’t be sure one way or the other. It is, however, pretty established thatthey get coronavirus, young children are far less at risk of falling very ill or having to go to hospital.

Leaders in Hartlepool have joined those in Liverpool by rejecting the plans which unions have slammed as putting teachers and children at risk. Union chiefs have accused ministers of going too fast and want more local control over theof schoolchildren.In a statement, Hartlepool Council said: Given that coronavirus cases locally continue to rise, Hartlepool Council has been working with schools and we have agreed they will not reopen on Monday  June.Whilst we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this.  We continue to work with schools to put in place appropriate measures to help keep children and staff safe when a phased reopening is possible. Patrick Roach, general secretary of union NASUWT, yesterday said it would take legal action against head teachersschools re-opened without proper protections for staff. But in an extraordinary turn, former Education Secretary David Blunkett has accused the unions of working against the interests of children. And Sir Anthony Seldon, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Buckingham and ex-head of Wellington College, said: Teachers want to and need to be back in schools.  As long as the scientists say they can, it is utterly wrong for unions to try to block and discourage teachers. While current Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has urged the unions to do their duty and halt any opposition to getting children back behind their desks despite the pandemic. Writing for the Daily Mail, he said ing kids to school is in the interests of their welfare and education. In Liverpool, city leaders said it was more likely school would notuntil mid-June- and children of key workers wouldfirst.  In a letter to parents, Liverpool councilaposs director for children and young peopleaposs services Steve Reddy warned: “There is no doubt in my mind that we simply cannot reopen schools in line with the suggested timetable outlined by the government. The layout of every school is dferent and they all have dferent challenges to overcome in terms of maintaining social distancing and hygiene. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson warned earlier this week that he would resist sending kids back at the beginning of next month, saying he had concerns about whether schools would be able to operate safely. He told BBC Newsnight: “I’m not going to take risks with children’s lives or with staff and teaching professionalsapos lives.”  The city councilaposs decision comes after Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, also split from the governmentaposs schools timeline. England is the only part of the UK asking schools to begin phased reopenings from the start of next month. Schools in Wales will not open on June , First Minister Mark Drakeford earlier confirmed.Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  set out plans to encourage the UK get back to normal after the coronavirus lockdown.One of the measures was to partially bring children back into primary schools, from Reception, Year  and Year .  The Department for Education said that kids would be kept apart in small groups, regular hand washing would be encouraged, and those with coronavirus symptoms would be asked not to go into school. But teaching unions have rejected the plans, saying teachers and children would be at risk of catching the disease and accelerating its spread back out in the community. In the North-east the aposRapos transmission rate is the highest in the country at around . - in London, the initial epicentre of the outbreak, itaposs .. On Friday, education unions were invited to a meeting with Government ministers and scientists about their plan. But union leader Dr Roach said the meeting has raised more questions than answers. He said the evidence to reopen on June  was weak and no new evidence had been provided. No confirmation was provided that teachers are at low risk of catching the virus following the wider opening of schools, he said. No clear information was provided on what modelling has been undertaken in relation to potential transmission rates when schools open more widely. Nothing in the meeting provided reassurance for the deeply worried and anxious school workforce. We are continuing to press for answers to these questions and also for clear guidance from Government to schools to ensure that they take appropriate and reasonable steps to assess and mitigate the health and safety risks posed by Covid-. Other Teesside councils have yet to make announcements about their plans. Jacob Young, Tory MP for Redcar, said he and fellow Conservative MP Simon Clarke had spoken to headteachers across Redcar and Cleveland on Friday. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household.

It is said that the salaries of standard flight attendants will be cut to £, a year and senior crew would have to downgrade to the level of basic crew, leaving staff appalled. The claims emerged just days after Britainaposs flag carrier confirmed , job cuts at the airline would still go ahead despite the Government extending its furlough scheme until the end of October. Unite, the union which represents cabin crew, said the cuts in pay are between  and  per cent for thousands of crew in a move that it potentially unlawful and a complete abuse of the furlough scheme.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening. Under the proposed terms and conditions of the new contract, cabin crew will receive commission from in-flight sales, performance incentives and a five per cent flex allowance. They will have access to a company pension scheme with company contributions of up to  per cent. Optional benefits include a private health care cash plan, private dental insurance, critical illness cover, le assurance and a cycle to work scheme, a source told . The source added: This is a flex arrangement that you pay for and not a benefit in kind. BA is planning to slash supervisory roles from , to  and cutting main crew numbers from , to ,. It is part of a move to a single crew team - from three separate fleets - to work across the airlineaposs fleet of Boeing and Airbus planes. Lower paid mixed fleet crew currently earn, on average, a reward package of between £, and £, per year, which includes a starting salary of £,. Customer service managers earn a package of £, on average, comprising a starting salary of £, and an hourly payment when they are flying. Some crew leaders, known as customer service directors, are said to earn up to £, a year. A BA worker told the Sun: “Crews face a  per cent pay cut depending on the number of flights they operate on. They are appalled.”  Under the new contract, senior crew members would downgrade to the level of basic crew and some short-haul flights would not have any managers on board, according to the travel website Head for Points, which was the first to report the signicant pay cut. The £, figure - for entry-level junior team members - is said to include an allowance to pay for food in hotels while travelling. Senior crew will be paid more and BA insists what it is offering is market rate. Each crew member  days of annual leave, including public holidays, the report added. It is said that no aposzero hoursapos contracts are being offered.  Some short-haul crew will now be required to work on long-haul flights, the report added. Rob Burgess, editor of Head for Points, the UKaposs biggest frequent flyer website, predicted that many senior crew members will refuse the contract and resign. He wrote: In general, this is what we expected to see – and, for legacy Heathrow crew, it isn’t pretty.  I would expect the majority of Eurofleet and Worldwide crew, who by definition have at least  years of British Airways service, to refuse to accept the new contracts.  Most will find it financially or logistically impossible to continue.  Staff have reportedly discussed strike action as Unite, the union which represents cabin crew and ground workers, takes legal action over BAaposs proposed job cuts. A BA spokesperson told : We can’t comment further while we consult with our unions. Unite assistant general secretary Howard Beckett said: “British Airways are cynically and opportunistically using the coronavirus pandemic to make swathes of workers redundant while simultaneously slashing the terms and conditions of the staff who remain. The cuts in pay are between  and  per cent for thousands of crew. We believe that this is not only potentially unlawful, but a complete abuse of the government Job Retention Scheme which was put in place to protect employees. “This is a complete betrayal of workers who have dedicated their lives to making the company the success it is today, who have helped build the huge cash reserves that enable BA to weather the current aviation crisis caused by Covid-.” Willie Walsh, chief executive of BAaposs owner, International Airlines Group, on Thursday confirmed that , job cuts at the airline will still go ahead despite the Government extending its furlough scheme until the end of October. He said the redundancy consultation will continue after he was asked to put it on hold. Mr Walsh wrote in a letter to MPs: We must act now to secure the maximum number of jobs possible, consistent with the reality of a structurally changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy. I want to confirm therefore that we will not pause our consultations or put our plans on hold. Industry figures believe it could take airlines at least three years toto pre-coronavirus levels, meaning they would not be able to financially support staff while flights remain unfilled.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email Natalie Poole arrived on the remote island of Kyun Pila in Myanmar on March  and planned to spend the next month working as a volunteer to help protect a coral reef - but then coronavirus hit.The -year-old, from Ashburton in Devon, is now trapped in a real le castaway drama after her only boat off the island was cancelled as Myanmar and nearby Thailand both went into lockdown. For the last two months, Natalie and four other volunteers have been forced to survive almost without any aid in one of the worldaposs most remote locations. Natalie and her fellow volunteers were due to be rescued on May  but were left devastated again when their boat was cancelled after Thailand extended its lockdown. The scuba er instructor, who should be back in Devon by now and working as a summer school teacher, is hopeful another boat will arrive to collect them later this month. However, her visa has expired and no new ones are being issued while the coronavirus pandemic holds the world in its grip. Natalie said: The hardest thing for me has been not knowing how long weaposre going to be here. Itaposs kind of up and down, weaposre a very small group of people and weaposre living in a very confined, close situation. In the back of our minds is obviously families back home and stuff, which adds to the tension a little bit. Weaposre just trying to take things day by day. But for now, the tiny group have had to do what they can to survive, using washed up bits of plastic to make their rainforest camp. They share the island with scorpions, snakes, mouse-deer, wild boar, monitor lizards, and slow lorises, and have to forage for most of their food, including yams, jackfruit and other vegetation. There have been sporadic deliveries by boat of food staples, including rice and pasta. But the group are conscious they have to make sure these last as they donapost know when the next one will arrive - and there have been plenty of days where they have gone hungry. Natalie said: We have to be very aware of how much we consume, we are eating very basic food and really having to make it last. Despite the desperate situation the group, which is made up of two women and three men from England, Hungary, Canada, Malaysia and France, find themselves in - they are not totally alone. There is one resort on Kyun Pila, Awei Pila, which is a  minute dinghy sail away and where they can access water, showers and accomodation on portable cabins, as well as a patchy wi signal. This has proved a leline for Natalie, who is concerned for her -year-old father, who lives in Poole in the UK. But the group, who are volunteers with environmental group Ocean Quest Global, have had to adapt quickly to spending so much extra time on the island. Their jungle camp has been constructed from washed up plastic, with each person living in a hut made from bamboo, rice sacks and bottles. They have even managed to erect furniture in their new Robinson Crusoe-inspired le, have dug a well, a fire pit and place to wash.The volunteers have also started planting their own vegetables. There are other challenges for the small group, existing in such extreme circumstances. Natalie explained: Usually in a programme like this there is a regular change of volunteers, which keeps things fresh and interesting, but the other three volunteers have been with each other a long time now and relationships are strained at times. Communal living is always a challenge because you get so little personal space and have to compromise a great deal. One person’s negative attitude or bad mood will affect everyone. The group has been forced to adapt to their change in circumstances, with people learning to hack jungle trails, drive a dingy and build with bamboo. Natalie has earned herself the nickname Trash Squirrel by spending her days combing the beach for washed up waste that can then be put to use to build the structures theyaposre calling home and to be turned into useful tools for surivival. But as spring slowly turns into summer Natalie and her fellow volunteers are facing a new challenge - the tropical rainy season. Already the clouds are coming in faster and the first few drops of rain have started to fall. They are working to do all they can to ensure they are as ready as possible for when the downpours do come.  However, Natalie is still hopeful that a rescue boat will come for them before the rainy season begins in earnest. She says it has also been a useful time for getting to know herself better.

The snap of the mindless act just outside Bolsover, Derbyshire, emerged after the ClearWaste app revealed cases have soared an average % – with some London boroughs hit by % increases. The alarming surge was driven by closures of tips and fewer bin collections under the Covid- lockdown, plus more waste being generated as self-isolating people did clear-outs, DIY and gardening. Other shocking images show a dozen bin bags full of household waste and broken electrical goods dumped in an idyllic woodland area in Aylesbury Vale, Buckinghamshire. And in Dartford, Kent, two lorry loads of tyres were just left by a roadside. Last weekend, fly-tippers dumped a ft pile of tyres, roof felt and insulation  near a mining memorial in the village of Halmerend, just outside Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. It honours more than  men and boys killed in England’s worst wartime mining disaster – an underground e­xplosion at the Minnie Pit in . Dozens of bin bags were also dumped at Soar cemetery in Llanelli, South Wales, this week, while  bags filled with broken mirrors, old clothes and household waste were left on the side of the ­mountains in Ebbw Vale. Earlier this week, people queued for hours to get rid of weeks of accumulated waste as many recycling centres and tips reopened. Councils urged only those with waste posing a health or safety risk to visit and shared links to webcams to help residents avoid queues. Martin Montague, who set up the ClearWaste fly-tipping reporting website and app, said: “We’ve seen a huge increase since lockdown.  It is disgraceful and adds to the burden on police and council workers, not to mention the cost and inconvenience to farmers working hard to keep the nation supplied with milk, meat and vegetables. “At the moment, householders must store things they’d normally take to a tip. “Don’t hand unwanted stuff to just any person with a van who offers to remove it for a bit of cash.

Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday.

Drinkers at the The Betsey Wynne in Swanbourne, Buckinghamshire, will enter and leave through a one-way system and be seated at tables two metres apart that are separated by Perspex screens. Customers will be urged to keep their hands clean with gel dispensers visually displayed throughout the premises and they will use disposable menus to place their order using a phone app. The pub would have a limit of  customers but the premises is spacious and also has a big beer garden. Peter Borg-Neal, CEO of Oakman Inns which owns the pub said is being used as a prototype to demonstrate how the scheme could offer pubs a leline. He told The Sun: “The country is desperate for a proper pint in the pub and we are asking the Government to treat us like grown-ups and let us open. “We strongly believe in this idea and are presenting it to the Cabinet Office via our trade body, UK Hospitality. A government adviser is reportedly supportive of the measures and brewery chiefs say it can be in place three weeks after getting the green light. The innovative plan comes hospitality bosses have warned that around , pubs may have to close their doors permanentlythey are among the last businesses to be allowed to reopen by the government.

Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the BBPA, said despite looking for a glimmer of hope, the industry now faced further weeks of uncertainty.

He added: “I can get on a Tube train with a load of strangers but I can’t go and have a pint in the pub with a mate. Where is the logic ” Government adviser Professor Robert Dingwall said: “If it is a sunny weekend and the pub has a garden and the landlords are prepared to accept responsibility for not overcrowding it, I see no particular reason why it should not reopen.” Mr Borg-Neal added: “We’d need three weeks’ notice to get in deliveries so evenwe got the all-clear on Monday we wouldn’t open until next month.

The home may look teeny from the outside but step inside the front door and this unassuming home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, hides an incredible secret. The cottage was the home of artist Antony Dracup, who spent years transforming it from a traditional terrace into something far more interesting. It boasts two bedrooms, a living room and a galley kitchen, perfect for family cooking. But walk further into the home and youaposll come to a massive sandstone cave, which comes complete with vaulted celings, ornate pillars and tile mosaics. And Antony didnapost stop there, he also created stunning landscaped gardens, a roof terrace, an attic room and a bathroom. Not only that but the determined artist completed many of his cave excavations by hand. His son, Dennis, explained: Every house that he took up residence in received the Dracup treatment – arches, pillars, balustrades, moulding, marbling, graining, nishing, stained-glass all designed and crafted from start to finish by his hand. In true Colditz style – a little every day, but persistently – he chiselled away. His persistence was rewarded with noticeably stronger chest muscles and extra living space.Antony died in  when he was  but he used the sandstone caves that are common in the area he lived in in Shropshire for his inspiration for the incredible adjustments to his home. The caves had previously been used as a place for young people to socialise but now form part of this unusual home. After moving into the home in the s, Antony worked tirelessly to transform it. The huge cave structure now makes up half the size of the property and he also levelled parts of the home to create ever bigger living spaces.But his first job was to sound-proof his house using an extra layer of bricks before he set about chiseling away at the cave that was originally in part of the garden. His son says on a website dedicated to his fatheraposs work: By way of a ladder it was possible to access the four levels of terracing, oddly and asymmetrically designed so as to fully involve the climber in the experience -you darenapost put a foot wrong here. Cast concrete, decorative features and moulding shared the daylight with lettuce, tomatoes an apple tree and much other edible produce. A vertical kitchen-garden which, to my fatheraposs delight, was once mistaken for a Roman Ruin in a local aerial survey.  Following Antonyaposs death all the subsequent owners have stayed true to his vision, keeping his stunning cave and all the intricate touches he had added. And when the property was last put on the market in  it had an asking price of just under £,.

Mike Cannizzaro, , who owns and operates a family entertainment center on the Jersey Shore called aposKnockerball  Moreapos, was devastated when he had to close up shop to help fight the spread of covid-. New Jersey has been hit hard by coronavirus with over , deaths being reported so far and all non essential businesses closed. Prior to lock down Mikeaposs center offered a range of fun activities from aposBubble Soccerapos to aposHuman Foosballapos and even a game called aposHungry Hungry Humansapos and had even been featured on The Today Show. But he wasnapost done with entertaining the public just just yet, thanks to the help of the centeraposs beloved prickly mascot - Pepper. Pepper, a two-year-old African Pygmy Hedgehog, who Mike describes as like his child, is a popular fixture at the centre where children love to watch her curl up in a ball as she sits in her own special chair by his desk. When asked about how heaposd found such an usual companion, Mike said: I live in a condo where they don’t allow traditional pets like cats and dogs, but I’m a huge animal lover. I looked online and I came across a post for a hedgehog needing a new home because the owner was in college and didnapost feel like she gave it enough attention.  I owned one when I was a little lad and I thought it would also make a great mascot for my business since the kids would love to see her, and they rolled into little balls like a aposmini Knockerballapos. I got in touch with the girl and the rest is history. But with more free time, and an energetic hedgehog on his hands every evening, Mike decided to do something special for his bundle of spikes, a giant obstacle course.  Mike said: While I was home self isolating and bored with nothing to do, I noticed Pepper was getting a little lazy because she was not socialising with the kids and getting out of her cage like she usually did. Every time I let her roam on the sofa she would always try to get down to the ground where she loves to run freely. I thought about it a little and gathered some items around the house and set them up on the sofas in my living room. He used everyday objects from pool noodles to Pringles cans to create an incredible climbing wall, and even finished the course with a slide and ball pit. In addition to the course, Mike also decided to get a little theatrical filming a commentated version, which has since amassed over  million views after being shared on a popular Instagram account.The one constant in the comments was people looking for another course so around the second week of April I made a second course and I got the same reactionnot better still asking for more. I figured I’d see how long this could go so I made a rd course the next week and this one really took off. It got played on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, People Magazine did a feature and NBC Sports picked it up as well. With all this attention I did a th and then a th Course and Pepper’s little fan basekeeps growing and they can’t seem to get enough. Mike has received dozens of comments from around the globe, including one that said Pepper was helping aposthem get through these dficult timesapos. The proud owner said he couldnapost help but apossmileapos as he read the comments and saw all the joy she was bringing.

More than , Italians have died of Covid- since the outbreak came to light on February , the third-highest death toll in the world after that of the United States and Britain. In a bid to contain the contagion, Italy was the first European country to impose nationwide restrictions in March, only sanctioning an initial relaxation of the rules on May , when it allowed factories and parks to reopen.  Shops are due to open on May  and the government decided that all movement within inidual regions should be allowed that same day, meaning people will be able to visit friends. The inter-regional and foreign travel ban will remain in place until after Italyaposs June  Republic Day holiday, preventing any mass travel over that long-holiday weekend. But all travel curb will be lted from June  - a major milestone on Italyaposs road to recovery, with the government hoping to salvage the forthcoming holiday season, when Italians traditionally escape the cities for their annual summer breaks. The regions can reactivate all sectors of the economy that might still be shuttered, so long as safety protocols are followed. National health authorities will monitor the situation to make sure infections are kept in check, the decree said.

It says some patients who survive Covid- will go on to require treatment for lung and heart damage, while others may suffer movement problems from muscle loss or psychological disorders. Most those who fall ill with coronavirus only suffer mild symptoms and should recover with minimal long-term health problems. However, patients who suffer severe cases of Covid- can suffer complications and organ damage such as heart arrhythmia or angina, and in many cases will require aftercare, according to the doctors. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Official figures suggest that more than , coronavirus patients have been now been discharged from hospital in China. The deadly bug is believed to have first jumped from animals to humans in the city of Wuhan at the end of last year, before spreading across China and becoming a global health emergency. The new advice from Chinaaposs National Health Commission warns that patients could go on to suffer depression, insomnia, eating disorders and ious mental and neurological issues. Doctors are also advised to look out for muscle wastage, and even the complete loss of limb .

My plan was to work as hard as I could to be part of the team.“If they wanted things done a certain way then I was going to do that to the best of my ability thenit doesn’t work out, I’ve done all I can.“There were big changes to training but going away for three weeks in pre-season to Italy was a big one. Usually you’d only be away for a week but this was a long time.“They did lay everything that was to happen out in front of you, though. However, there was a strict menu on offer –you didn’t like it, you’d go hungry.”Training too was completely dferent as Dundee adopted a football strategy that had served the Bonetti brothers in their homeland.As a future coach and boss, Smith says he learned a lot during their time in the City of Discovery, evensome elements of their approach were dficult to get to grips with.“The way they structured training was completely dferent as well but dferent managers all have dferent views,” he added.“Training would change time but we’d train every day and there were a few double sessions.“They relied on doing the same thing rigidly over and over so you knew what you were getting and there was very little change.“I have to say I learned a lot about working on shape and positional play. Previous managers had done shape but not to the extent the Bonettis worked on it.“Training could be a bit off-the-cuff sometimes. They were obviously new to coaching themselves and learning as they went.”There were high-profile disagreements as foreign signings kept Scottish players out of the starting XI.The Bonetti brothers’ volatile nature also led to fall outs behind the scenes, but Smith focused on working hard in training and reaping the rewards.“I always treat people as they treat me and the Bonettis treated me very well,” he said.“I’m not saying they did that with every player – there were definitely a few not treated as well as they should have been.“I played with players I never expected to line up alongside at Dundee. Georgi Nemsadze was wonderful, Claudio Caniggia was a top talent, but they also needed the Scottish guys like myself, Gav Rae, Steven Tweed and Willie Falconer to make the core of the team.“I don’t think the foreign guys really understood Scottish football or knew what to expect.“We all just got our heads down and knuckled down to work. I think the Bonettis appreciated that.“They were good times and I’m sure the fans wouldn’t change seeing those players in dark blue even with what happened afterwards in administration.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53769228-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53769228-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53769228-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53769228-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united johnny russell transfer news","story":"Ex-Dundee United star Johnny Russell is open to ato Tannadice.Russell is back in training with MLS side Sporting Kansas City, with whom he has established himself as a fan-favourite.But while he is loving le in the States, Russell is not against the idea of finishing his playing career back where it started.“I had a great relationship with the fans – hopefully at some point I will maybe get the chance to get myself there,” Russell said of United to the BBC.“I wouldn’t say I have got a desire to come back – I love it where I am – but I would never turn my nose up to come back and play in Scotland.”Russell spent five successful years with Derby County after leaving United in .His subsequent move to the US, aged just , came as a shock.But his red hot MLS form has led to continued Scotland recognition – and paved the way for former United man Gary Mackay-Steven and ex-Celtic kid Lewis Morgan to join him in the States.For Russell, success in America has vindicated his leap of faith.“I said at the time that I felt it was the right decision.

If you had to have them it would be in a final, but the draw was kind to us with Raith.“They’d been doing well under John McGlynn but it gave us an opportunity to go to Hampden.“One of the things that sticks in my mind is we had the Sunday game but on Saturday, Ross County were playing Celtic.“We were going to the Westerwood Hotel in Cumbernauld to stay overnight.“We’d trained at Tannadice and headed down. I was off to Falkirk to watch them play St Mirren but Gary Kirk and Paul Hegarty went with the team on the bus.“I was listening to the radio all the way and about half-way down Ross County went one-up.“By the time I’m in the car park at Falkirk, Ross County score again with minutes to go to make it - and it really hit me then.“That was the first time I thought to myself, ‘There’s only three teams left and we’re now the favourites for the cup’.“I felt a bit of pressure going into the Raith Rovers game that we had to go out and do our business.“We were nervous but, thankfully, I had a group of players behind me who were magnicent and we beat Raith comfortably after a slow -minute start.”Although they were indeed favourites at that stage to go on and lt the cup, Houston insists that wasn’t always the case.The -year-old believes the Tangerines still had to do it the hard way in beating Partick, St Johnstone and champions Rangers after a replay to get their shot at Hampden glory.He continues: “A lot of people say Dundee United had it easy because we played Ross County in the final but they forget about the journey.“The fact is we had an away game at Partick Thistle then we were away to Premier League St Johnstone in the next round. That’s never an easy fixture.“We went down there and I remember Gary’s father had died during that week.“The players decided they wanted to wear black armbands and dedicated the win to Bobby Kirk, who was an ex-Hearts league and cup winner way back.“It was a nice gesture for the players, that’s the type of boys they were.“We went to Ibrox after that to play a strong Rangers side, who were the champions.“That was three in a row away from home in the Scottish Cup so we didn’t have an easy draw.“We were - down after Rangers got a couple of penalties, the usual at Ibrox, but to our credit we scored goals.“To see Andis Shala and Mihael Kovacevic on the scoresheet was something unusual. We got a wee break as well with wee Morgaro Gomis’ volley being deflected in.“They thought the game was won at -. They had downed tools a bit and the crowd was away to miss the traffic.“That set us up for our only home tie, the replay at Tannadice. That was a memorable game for the supporters.“The treble-buster, as he calls himself, David Robertson scored with his backside in the last minute.“That was the best thing for us because there wasn’t much time for Rangers to go and put up a comeback.“We were the better team and deserved to win.”United would see off Ross County in the final thanks to a second-half strike from David Goodwillie and a Craig Conway double.Nearly , Arabs rejoiced in watching on as Houston  Co climbed the steps to lt the Scottish Cup for the first time since .He continues: “It hits you when you’re walking out prior to kick-off and it’s just a sea of tangerine.“There were , Arabs there and that was a sight to behold. It’s so colourful.“A lot of people thought it wouldn’t be a good atmosphere because it was Dundee United and a smaller club like Ross County but to be fair to them I think Dingwall emptied for that day.“It was a busy final and the pressure was on us that we should win this cup.“There’s an added pressure there because you’re desperately keen to not mess it up for the fans.“The Saturday night and Sunday celebrations at Tannadice and City Square were amazing.“It’s something you can’t take away from that group of players and it will never leave my memory.”The celebrations would go on for days after but it is only now Houston looks back at their win as greatness achieved not bestowed.He credits predecessor Craig Levein for laying the foundations and admits there is a special sense of pride at achieving Scottish Cup glory, something the man who started it all, Jim McLean, couldn’t do.“As you get older you start asking yourself, ‘Where did those  years go to ’” he says.“It brought joy to a lot of United fans who’d only seen them win it once prior with Ivan Golac.“It felt surreal that Jim, who was the best manager of them all, hadn’t been able to get it over line with the amount of times he took United to Scottish Cup Finals.“It was great for me, personally, being the manager of United then and doing that.“The big thing for me was we had a brilliant group of players.“Craig and I had went in a few years before and he deserves credit as well. Him and I worked really hard building a new squad.“We were bottom of the league when we went in back in . Wee Eddie Thompson’s only words to Craig and I were, ‘Just keep my team in the top ision’.“We managed to finish ninth that season then fth for the next couple of years.“I was delighted that when I took over and Craig went away to be the Scotland manager we finished third, won the cup and went into Europe three years in a row.“It had been a long time for the club since it had been on that stage and they haven’t been since.“A lot of people forget that, yes we won the Scottish Cup, but we finished third behind a very strong Rangers and Celtic, and nine points ahead of Hibs.“It was a magnicent achievement and turned out a wonderful season.”Dundee United#s Scottish Cup-winning boss Peter Houston hopes Robbie Neilson can lead Terrors to Hampden triumph\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-peter-houston-robbie-neilson embed # secretIXeWqxySKj\" data-secret\"IXeWqxySKj\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/ginkin/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2020/05/Gin-and-Valencian-Orange-Tonic-Chocolate-Tart-612x360.jpg ","title":"revealed dario bonetti kicked rugby park","story":"The Bonetti era at Dundee didn’t throw up many dull moments – and Kilmarnock fans will certainly remember the night assistant Dario entertained them in the stands at Rugby Park.A combination of a car accident, a paperwork error and Bonetti missing a Killie goal saw Ayrshire fans that night experience both sides of the charismatic and, at times, volatile Italian.With no place on the bench for Dark Blues assistant manager, Dario watched the game from the press box behind the home supporters in the main stand.The Evening ’s former senior football writer, Tom Duthie, had a front-row seat to the spectacle.He said: “Most of the squad had travelled the night before the game, but Dario Bonetti was heading west on the Saturday.“Unfortunately an accident blocked the main road between Glasgow and Kilmarnock and along with most fans, and press, Dario did not arrive at Rugby Park in time for kick off.“When he got there he found his name had not been included on the official list of those in the Dundee technical area and, for once, the assistant manager had to head for the stand to observe the action.“Along with full-back Marcello Marrocco, who was injured, he decided to join us in the press box at the back of the main stand.“Given that the stand is for home fans, it crossed my mind this could lead to problems because I knew there was no way the passionate Italian would stay quiet. He didn#t.“But as well as kicking every ball for his team, big Dario also engaged with the punters sitting nearby and gave them what must have been one of their most entertaining match experiences ever.“Unfortunately for Dario his late arrival meant he missed an opening goal for Killie and although Dundee equalised before the break he was still unaware of it as he headed for the dressing-room at half-time.“There were some confused players in there as he blasted them and told them they were lucky to be ahead.“When he repeated that opinion on retaking his seat for the second-half I can remember a couple of awkward minutes as Marrocco, Dundee#s press officer Niall Scott and I discussed who should be the one to tell him the correct score.“I escaped that dangerous task by pointing out I was not a club employee and they were.“If memory serves me, it was Marrocco who broke the news, to be met with an eruption from his assistant gaffer.“I should add that outside of game time, Dario was as charming as his brother.“In their first season together the pair steered Dundee to a top six finish and produced a team capable of playing football that was as pleasing on the eye as anything theof the country.“As their second season progressed, however, Ivano was making increasingly frequent trips back to Italy and it was clear all was not well behind the scenes.“It came as no surprise when he was replaced by Jim Duffy in the summer of  and in just over another year the extent of the club#s spending during the Bonetti experiment became clear as it plunged into administration and was on the brink of extinction.“For all that, Dundee fans understandably remember those two years with great fondness, as do press men like myself who experienced a time the like of which is highly unlikely to be seen again.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

disabilities and le-limiting conditions, is appealing for people to get behind its Charlie House Support Our Servicesinitiative.The charity hopes the initiative will help raise further funding for their services during the coronavirus pandemic as it relies on donations to keep them going.Anyone can take part by texting CHARLIESOS to , which will automatically donate £.Susan Crighton, director of fundraising for Charlie House, said: “For families in the UK, we have had to adapt to a very dferent way of le over the last couple of months.“We have had to adjust to le without access to mainstream schooling, activity clubs, friends and grandparents, all of which help give us an opportunity to rest and recharge.“While many will say there have been wonderful moments that they will cherish, most will also say that it has been really challenging having their support network removed.“For Charlie House supported families, dficulties in accessing specialist care for a child with complex disabilities means that only families often meet % of their child’s care requirements with little or no opportunity for respite.“The risk of complications from what we regard as everyday infections can result in long periods of isolation for children with complex disabilities and their families. That is why what we do is so important.”The charity is currently carrying out its services by facilitating regular video calls for therapeutic and emotional support, liaising with medical teams and providing pre and post-bereavement support, as well as creating and delivering isolation packs.Online activity sessions are also being used as a means to continue aiding those struggling.Susan added: “It has always been our mission to provide support to babies, children and young people that have le-limiting conditions and their families by helping provide access to the right care, information, activities and, ultimately, a purpose-built respite care facility in the north-east.“The need now is greater than ever for this. These donations will help to ensure that we can do that because we can’t continue without them.”For more information, visit charliehouse.org.ukFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/05/Bowie-3_35396139-560x564.jpg ","title":"david bowie at the music hall as youve never seen him before in colour","story":"It was one of the most iconic and historic gigs to take place in the Music Hall – May  in , David Bowie on his Ziggy Stardust tour.Many people are familiar with the old black and white image of Bowie, lunging forward as he belts out a number to a packed audience of adoring fans.But today we can reveal never-before-seen colour photographs of that memorable concert, taken by a teenager in the audience who managed to dodge security to snap away at the front of the stage.They show Bowie, dressed in a red jumpsuit, as he was morphing into Aladdin Sane, the unmissable frescos of the Music Hall behind him. vw, px\"  Other pictures show Spiders From Mars guitarist Mick Ronson, in full throttle at the height of the gig – the Music Hall’s organ visible in the background.These snapshots of a moment in time were taken by a then -year-old Doug Anderson.Doug, now , takes up the tale of how he captured these remarkable shots.“I had to avoid the security folk to get up to the front to take the pictures,” said Doug, an aviation agent at Aberdeen International Airport.“But at the end, the band shouted all the folk to come up the front and I got a couple more. It was one of those old-fashioned Kodak cameras, with the revolving flashbulb.”Doug remembers the exhilarating atmosphere of the concert.“It was packed to the roof, just mobbed.“Bowie was just his usual flamboyant self. There were a few costume changes he went through. He had that red jumpsuit, then he came on in what was almost like hotpants, but it was a zip-up suit.” vw, px\"  Doug remembers that Bowie actually played two shows at the Music Hall that day – one at .pm the other at pm # and he went to both.“It was exactly the same show the second time around as well. I thought he might have mixed it up.“I saw it advertised in the paper that there were two on the same night and I thought ‘I’m going to have to have some of that’. I remember paying very, very little for the tickets.”“I had a few of his records and I quite liked the Ziggy Stardust album. That was the final tour of Ziggy Stardust. I didn’t know that at the time. He only announced that at Hammersmith. The band didn’t even know, apparently. So I was quite lucky to catch it.”Doug said that at that point in time, he had little inkling Bowie would become the global icon he did.“You didn’t know what he was going to do next. You never did.” vw, px\"  It sparked a lelong passion for concerts in the Granite City that has never left Doug. But he doesn’t actually rate the Bowie gig as the best he’s ever seen.“Bowie was really good but the best one I remember – apart from Queen at the Capitol – was Black Sabbath with Van Halen in support.#That would have been in  in the Music Hall and that was mental. Van Halen just blew them off the stage – and it was the original Sabbath as well. Sabbath was who I had wanted to see,  I had never heard of this other lot until that night. They were incredible.”Doug wasn’t the only Bowie fan to go the extra mile on May  .Graeme Thain also pulled out all the stops to get to the gig as a -year-old pupil at Robert Gordon’s College.“At one stage my parents weren’t going to let me go”, said Graeme, former proprietor of Thain’s Bakery.“They didn’t think he was a good influence on a young mind because of his controversial lestyle. I just rebelled and went anyway. But they certainly weren’t keen for me to embark on a le of going to gigs like that.”Not only did he and his friends attend the gig – in school unorm #  they also found themselves enshrined in history. If you look at that unforgettable image of Bowie on stage, Graeme and his mates can be seen at the front of the balcony. They are the ones with the David Bowie scarf draped over the balustrade. vw, px\"  Graeme, now , said they got prime seats – bought from the legendary Telemech on Marischal Street, “the” record shop in Aberdeen at the time # for one simple reason.“He sold out his first concert so fast, he did a matinee performance for us kids, so we were able to pick up A seats.#The gig was mindblowing. It was exciting, it was enthusiastic. A lot of the audience were that sort of age and it was just brand new for us.“Bowie’s performance was electric, theatrical – that’s an understatement. Mick Ronson was amazing on the guitar.But just being at the gig wasn’t the end of Graeme’s entanglement with Bowie. He actually met the man and got his autograph – in one of his Robert Gordon’s jotters.“My friend Ronald and I went stalking him, because we heard he was staying at the Imperial Hotel,” said Graeme. “We stood outside and both of us, with our school jotters managed to get his autograph by waiting for him. He was a friendly chap.”And how would he sum up the gig itself “It was one of the most amazing experiences in a young boy’s le.”Also at the Bowie concert was one Barney Crockett, these days better known as the Lord Provost of Aberdeen.Back then, though, he was a steward for the gig as a favour to a friend, and got some unforgettable memories as part of the bargain.“It was a stunning performance. By modern standards it would be not dramatic, but at that time to have sudden changes of costume. David Bowie’s clothes split in half to reveal another persona underneath. That was not usual at the time,” said Barney.He added that another thing which might suprise modern gig-goers is the young age of the audience.“For years, people just didn’t believe me that it was mainly schoolgirls that went to concerts at that time. But the picture fromshows that. It was very cheap to get in to concerts then. The LP would cost many more times than the entry to a concert. It was really a promotion. You went on tour to promote your records and get on TV.”Barney said the gig was put on by the aforementioned Telemech record shop and recalls the stewarding would have been regarded as amateurish by today’s standards – which might account for Doug getting his precious snaps.“The person who organised it was just in his mid-s… and he knew me through the working in the fish and it’s amazing really that was how I became a steward,” said Barney.“The atmosphere was frenzied, but mainly very young women, schoolgirl age. The concert was very transgressive for the time. Bowie and the band’s looks were trying to be sexually ambiguous and that was quite advanced and very wild.“They wouldn’t be allowed today to get the crowd’s mood to the degree it was. We were trying to get people to not stand on the seats.”Barney said the Ziggy Stardust tour was breakthrough moment that transformed Bowie into a superstar.“This was one of the standout gigs Aberdeen has seen. It was historic.”No doubt there are many other people in Aberdeen who have memories to relive of that glory day… and now they can dream of it in technicolour, thanks to Doug’s remarkable photos.David Bowie’s groundbreaking music inspired generations during a career spanning six decades. He died aged  on January   after suffering cancer for  months.The singer passed away surrounded by his loved ones, a statement on his Facebook page said today.The star made a habit of confounding the critics – killing off his most famous creation, Ziggy Stardust, at the height of his fame – and reinventing himself in roles including glam rocker, soul singer and hippie songwriter.Bowie, born David Jones in post-war Brixton, south London, kicked off his music career in the RB boom of the early sixties.In  he made his first appearance in the charts with Space Oddity. A string of albums followed, before ’s The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars made him an international star.The s saw him combine his pop career with appearances in films including Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence and Absolute Beginners.Bowie made a surprise comeback in  when he suddenly released a new single on his th birthday with an album out just weeks later, his first for  years.He released his final album, Blackstar, just three days before his death was announced.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/05/5ebf965c179628.86028618-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"new figures reveal one third of north east workforce are key workers","story":"New statistics have revealed that around a third of those employed in each of the north-east areas are classed as key workers.Data released by the Office for National Statisticshas given an indication of the number of people employed in  in key worker occupations, based on an interpretation of UK Government guidance.The figures, released yesterday, cover the whole of the UK and are broken down into regions.The status of workers has become particularly prominent in recent months due to the coronavirus pandemic.In Aberdeen, just over a quarter of the population has been identied as a key worker, with an estimation of .% given.Statistics broken down for the Aberdeen city region, a slightly wider scope, revealed that .% of the population were employed in the education and childcare sector, .% in the food and necessary goods industries and .% in health and social care.The figure for key public services was given as .%, while an estimated .% of residents worked in transport and public safety as well as national security.The report stated that .% of the population were employed in the utilities and communication sectors.Meanwhile, just over a third of those in Aberdeenshire and Moray qualied as key workers.

He was quiet, but had a way about, a really good character and integrated with the boys.“Him and Eoin Jess during my time in Aberdeen were at a dferent level from everybody  in terms of what they could do.“Arild was dferent in that he was just a natural goalscorer, but I don’t even think he liked football.“He actually said at one point ‘I don’t enjoy playing football, I just do it for the money’ and I was blown away.“He said ‘I think I want to write my own book or go into coaching. I think I’d prefer to do that.’McNaughton went on to explain, although Stavrum#s workrate wasn#t the highest, he was the type of talent who would #do nothing for  minutes and score two goals#.Injury and a less warm relationship with Paterson during Pele#s year-and-a-half at Pittodrie saw #Super Kev# making fewer Aberdeen starts, before his final two seasons under Calderwood, where he was once again a mainstay of the team.McNaughton revealed he thinks Calderwood#s tendency to chop and change his team and the lack of a domestic cup run were his downfall, despite top-six finishes and # after McNaughton#s departure # a fantastic run in the UEFA Cup which included meetings with Atletico Madrid, Lokomotiv Moscow, Copenhagen and Bayern Munich.In the episode of Northern Goal, which is available on your favourite podcast app, McNaughton also reveals the real story of his Dons departure, his reflections on owner Vincent Tan, FA Cup and League Cup losses in his time at Cardf City, as well as counting the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Craig Bellamy and Robbie Fowler as team-mates.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 11 coronavirus and the masters","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of other things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre.This week we discuss the effect of the Corona virus  on the tours, Steevie#s discovery of old golf clubs which he hopes might make him his fortune, Rangefinders and other golf tech and we take a quick visit to the old course in St. AndrewsAn entertaining listen which you can download for freePlay or download the episode in the link below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll rallyers in inverness action","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe opening round of the  KNC Groundworks Scottish Rally Championships took place in and around Inverness last weekend with a good entry of  cars.The event, on Saturday March , was three weeks later than usual to try and avoid the worst of the weather. There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings. They had a good day and brought the car home in th overall and eighth in a competitive Class . They plan to do the full season, so watch this space for updates on their progress.The closely contested event was finally won by Michael Binnie and Clare Mole in a Mitsubishi Evo, with the ever present Jock Armstrong and Cameron Fair taking second place in the TEG Sport Impreza, after leading the rally for much of the day. Freddie Milne and Patrick Walsh in the Fiesta R were third overall.Next up is the Speyside Rally in Elgin on April ."},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre has its finger on the pulse","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Soccer Centre volunteers have received vital first aid training.Sports clubs are required to ensure a number of their volunteers have a valid first aid certicate and when Lochgilphead Soccer Centre looked to secure the services of an accredited firm to provide the required two-day course, outdoor and first aid coach Andy Craven was happy to help.Covering theory and practice of all fundamental aspects of first aid, the volunteers were grateful to Andy for his informative and interactive approach to learning important skills and knowledge to safeguard the welfare of players and spectators.Soccer Centre chairman Stuart Green  said: #It is not just about having the relevant certicate, but ensuring a good number of our volunteers have the knowledge, skills and equipment to look after our youngsters and their friends and families.#Knocks and sprains are common in football and we deal with them every week, however, even as volunteers, we have an obligation to be prepared with any eventuality and Andy was first class in guiding our volunteers through a range of scenarios.#Andy said: #Whilst first aid is a serious business, the folks at Lochgilphed Soccer Centre were a great bunch. They were keen to learn and kept me on my toes with a range of questions.#I am a qualied outdoor and first aid instructor and have been working with community and sports groups throughout Argyll and Bute and their enthusiasm and desire to develop skills to look after members of their community in the event of something going wrong never ceases to impress me.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

This year the figure fell to less than  per cent.The council also refuses to allow children whose parents opt to keep them home and fund the nursery place themselves to remain in school nurseries.Parents who decide to pay for an additional year of nursery themselves to keep their children out for a year face bills of up to pound, and a hunt for alternative child care places.Another mum who was refused funding said she had initially been supported in her view that her child was too immature to start school by her nursery.But they withdrew that support after pressure from the councilrsquos education department, she said.ldquoThey were told that they couldnrsquot support us because we didnrsquot meet the council policy criteria and withdrew their support, she explained.ldquoOur views meant nothing and the impact on our child meant nothing.And other parents expressed fears that their children were being robbed of nursery experience because they have been in lockdown for some of the vital months they would have had and would have no transition into school.One mum said: Children who start school at -years-old already receive a year less nursery time than those who are older, that has been reduced further by the closure of nurseries.ldquoHow can we ask these young children to go from months at home with their family to suddenly starting primary one with no transition A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoconfirmed they have now agreed to approve all deferral requests for the year ahead.They said: ldquoAs a result of the ongoing closure of schools and nurseries, we have been reviewing applications for deferred entry to P, ahead of session  . Due to the current situation, applications for deferred entry and a further funded year have now been approved. Following the full, national implementation of the expansion of early learning and childcare, we will carry out a review of our wider policy on deferred entry.Thank you for reading this story.

reopening, Mr Eustice said: ldquoI think our view is that probably a McDonaldrsquos drive-thru is made for the social distancing situation we are in, in that people do not leave their car, they place their order and someone passes a bag of food to them at the end through a kiosk.Unlike many other businesses, fast-food outlets were not mandated to close during the lockdown.Some chains have begun to

restaurants opening for deliveries from next week.Askedoutlets could have stayed open during the crisis, Mr Eustice said: ldquoWhile clearly restaurants and pubs had to close, we were quite keen to keep that capacity to be able to do takeaway food for people.He suggested reduced footfall in town centres, staff anxiety and a sense of what was ldquosocially acceptable given the stay-at-home message had led to places such as McDonaldrsquos and KFC closing.Mr Eustice added: ldquoI think it is quite possible for these venues to reopen and reopen safely, we never mandated that they should close.ldquoI think some of those food-to-go businesses will probably be seeking to learn lessons from what supermarkets have done as they consider tentatively reopening.New safety measures have been

have been tested and could be opened immediately to host tourists, Friedrich Joussen, TUI Group CEO said.Several other European holiday spots could also be among the list of destinations, including Greece, Cyprus, Croatia and Bulgaria, all of which Joussen described as ldquowell prepared for summer tourism.Austria and Denmark were named as possible destinations as well, being among a number of EU countries that are starting to reopen their borders.However, the roll out of flights to Europe will have to be done gradually, and in line with both government guidance on travel and the lting of EU borders.Holidays to Europe are also likely to be hindered by the  day quarantine period being enforced by many countries, with tourists faced with spending two weeks in quarantine in Spain before being able to start their holiday.In contrast, visits to France and Ireland will be unhindered by such rules.How will TUI make its hotels safe The package holiday specialist has outlined a ten-point plan, detailing how hotels will operate after lockdown is lted.Plans include restrictions on its popular self-service buffets, which are due to be reduced to a minimum.Instead, food and beverages will be served to guests by staff wearing protective masks, where possible.The measures will be implemented across all of the companyrsquos own-brand hotels, and will also be made ldquoavailable to joint-venture and partner hotels.Guests will face limits on their range of entertainment and activities, with football tournaments set to be banned.Only events, sports and entertainment that involve a small number of participants, and without close contact, will be made available.Other measures include online check-ins, maintaining social distancing in public areas, such as gyms and corridors, and reduced capacity in restaurants, with longer opening hours to spread guest usage.There will also be an increase in disinfectant dispensers throughout TUIrsquos hotels, and ldquoextensive new cleaning practices will be implemented for rooms.TUI said that its new  point plan is in addition to statutory regulations, which will be put in place at all of the holiday destinations where it operates.The

Bear in mind that our major flood retailers arenrsquot short of a bob or two at the moment.The UK Government has handed them hundreds of millions in business rate relief ndash thatrsquos our taxpayersrsquo cash ndash while they support the food chain in Poland and Ireland. And as the eating out sector has disappeared, supermarkets have benefited directly, showing their strongest sustained sales period for years.Make no mistake about it. If supermarkets get away with building their beef supply chain on imports, Scottish beef farmers might as well shut up shop now.Given the rate that state-aid subsidised meat imports are flooding into the country, we wonrsquot have a livestock industry left. So,you do buy your beef in supermarkets, herersquos my plea. If you spot Irish beef in your store, embarrass the retailer in question by putting a picture on social media, accompanied by the obvious question: lsquoHerersquos supermarket X selling imported beef instead of Scotch. Why Or make an online complaint. Even speak to the store manager, from a suitable distance away, of course. This is a really important consumer battle.If we want Scotland to keep on producing its world renowned, grass-fed beef, we must embarrass the retailers that undermine our native beef farmers while posturing about their steadfast support for them. In fact, why not dump supermarket beef shopping and start buying from an independent butcher, farm shop, or online, direct from the farmer I avoid shopping in supermarkets, but evenyoursquore a supermarket regular, yoursquoll likely accept that meat is not their strongest department. Neither the eating quality of their beef, nor their butchery, can compare with that of a skilled, specialist butcher. And they donrsquot stock a full, nose-to-tail range of cuts, preferring to sell us mountains of nondescript mince and anonymous lsquosteakrsquo and lsquostewrsquo cuts that are taste ndash and tenderness ndash challenged.Proper butchers, by contrast, can be relied on to source Scotch beef first and foremost, beef that eats well. The best amongst them usually know the farm and farmers that produced it.Stocking up family freezers before lockdown, I gave my daughter mince from my local butcher. When she got round to cooking it, she phoned me up to ask me what it was. ldquoIt smells so good, and itrsquos just so dferent from supermarket mince. The smell as you fry that up makes me feel sick. But this makes my mouth water.Why the contrast  As I discovered when I investigated supermarket meat for my book Shopped ndash The Shocking Power of British Supermarkets, the butchering in the meat plants that supply them is crude, often careless.The beef is rarely adequately aged, and must, through the application of modied air packaging, look wet and ruby-red when packed. Any good cook or chef knows that this state does not make for rewarding eating. Why make do with supermarket beef when you could be eating the good stuff "},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-pretence-transparency-not-scotland-needs","story":"In recent weeks, ministers north and south have been falling over themselves to embrace their fallibility. Mistakes will be made in the handling of the coronavirus, they say. Wersquore learning on the job. But trust us, wersquore doing our best.Nicola Sturgeon, for example, told Holyrood on Wednesday: ldquoI said that I would make mistakes and that the Government would make mistakes, and I am sure that is the case.ldquoWe are dealing with an unprecedented situation.Irsquom sure she and counterparts are doing their best as they wrestle with the unknown, and footling administrative bungles are being conceded along the way.But when it comes to the big stuff that could have cost lives, itrsquos back to the usual spikey defensiveness.The UK Government missing its , tests a day target  Not a mistake, ministers cry every pm. You lot donrsquot understand success.The Scottish Government missing its , tests a day target  Not a blunder either, comes the response. Itrsquos all going pretty well, considering.Just donrsquot mention it would take almost two years to test everyone in Scotland and the UK at this rate.As for Covid scything through care homes, itrsquos nothing to do with us, Guv.Take Boris Johnsonrsquos misleading bluster when cornered by Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs this week.ldquoIt remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care homehellipwill become infected, the Labour leader quoted from the UK Government official advice in place up to March .ldquoNot true that the advice said that, replied the PM, instantly grasping the political danger of such insouciance,not grasping the facts.But it was exactly what it said.:Councils face poundm lockdown shortfallThe guidance is there on the UK Government website under a warning that it was withdrawn on March .Thatrsquos more transparency than you get with the Scottish Governmentrsquos website, where withdrawn guidance has been vigorously deleted.Like the official advice to care homes published on March  which gives a chilling clue as to why almost half the Covid- deaths in Scotland have occurred under care home roofs.ldquoIt is not advised that residents [with Covid] in long term care are admitted to hospital for ongoing management but are managed within their current setting, it told staff.In other words, Scots homes were discouraged from sending Covid patients to a hospital, despite the fuller range of care on offer and the higher grade PPE there, plus the risk of sick residents acting as sources of infection to others in the home.The latest version of this guidance, published yesterday, says a transfer to a hospital ldquoshould take place after a clinical assessment that is in the best interest of the resident, in keeping with their choices, and where the care required cannot be done in the home.The March  document also says new residents arriving from hospital ldquodo not routinely need confirmation of a negative Covid test. Now two negative results are mandatory.You wonrsquot find it easy to compare one version with the other, however, because the first has been all but scrubbed from the internet. It lingers on in a handful of web caches.But asked on Wednesdayshe thought early mistakes led to excess deaths and testing in homes had been a failure, Ms Sturgeon was emphatic. ldquoNo, I do not, she told MSPs.She then said the high mortality rate was ldquonot caused by our handling the virus in care homes as other countries are it is intrinsic to the dficult nature of the virus. Intrinsic to the virus. Oh well then. Thatrsquos that.The Scottish Government was also apparently blameless in its handling of our first big Covid outbreak, when  people, eight from Scotland, caught it at a Nike conference in Edinburghrsquos Hilton Carlton in late February.Ministers knew about it by March , when cases started appearing, but still let Scotland play France at Murrayfield five days later, and didnrsquot ban large gathering until March .They said nothing about the Nike incident for two months, until a BBC documentary revealed it last week.:Letters: We are being held back by the timidity of the Scottish GovernmentMs Sturgeon denies a cover-up, saying the first case was mentioned at the time in a press release. However, that merely referred to an infected person in Scotland who ldquohad contact with a known positive case, without saying they caught it in Scotland, far less a major outbreak in Edinburgh.The First Minister says she accepted advice that patient confidentiality could have been compromisedshersquod said more, but that was looking at the issue the wrong way around.ldquoThe thing that wasnrsquot said was that there were a number of cases associated with one event, she said. Well quite. Thatrsquos the problem.Ms Sturgeon also says everyone who needed to be contact-traced was contact-traced. But that assumes a perfect system in which everyone remembered exactly who they met for  minutes or more over  hours. Publicising the outbreak would have helped identy people who would otherwise have been missed.Quizzed by the media on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon insisted she was satisfied at the time, and remains satisfied, that ldquoall appropriate steps were taken.However her knowledge of what happened at the time seems hazy.ldquoIrsquom not even sure I knew what the venue was until it was reported in this programme, she blurted out.Itrsquos hard to see how she could be happy all steps were taken without knowing basics like that. The venue was not some isolated country retreat. It was a very large hotel on one of the busiest streets in Scotlandrsquos capital, a few yards from the Royal Mile. That information was surely relevant, and her lack of curiosity looks culpable.This retreat from candour is especially worrying as we pivot to the next phase of the crisis, and the ginger easing of the lockdown. Ms Sturgeon must give an update by May .When Mr Johnson replaced Stay at Home with Stay Alert in England, the First Minister and others complained it was vague and imprecise advice.It was, next to Stay at Home. That was as definitive as it gets. The next phase will be vague and imprecise.Even the Scottish Governmentrsquos latest framework paper on easing the lockdown says people will need to ldquoremain vigilant for symptoms of Covid in others, aka stay alert.Asked for her superior alternative slogan last week, Ms Sturgeon tellingly failed to offer one.The months ahead will be messy. As people go out more, the virus will go with them. The R number will flutter disconcertingly. Politicians will make more mistakes. The stressed-out ones in office will doubtless seethe about mouthy idlers in opposition.But truth and transparency will serve everyone better than carping and sour denials. Instead of all this professed openness and honesty, the country will need the real thing."},{"url":null,"title":"americans-love-scotland-much-visit-californias-scotsfestival-find","story":"ACCIDENTALLY admit to an American that you are Scottish and you can generally expect to hear either that they are Scottish, too, that it is their dream to visit Scotland, or that their forefathers came from a place called lsquoGlass-gowrsquo and perhaps you have heard of it I am never prouder of our country than when I am away from it, but living amongst such unearned devotion has often led me to wonder just what it is about our little nation that inspires such affection. Is it our renowned landscapes, our progressive politics or our mind-blowing litany of world-changing inventions  Is it our whisky, our golf, our Andy Murray  Is it simply our legendary humility Fortunately, I knew where to look for the answer, because each summer many Americans demonstrate their affinity for our country by attending Scottish festivals. Here in Calornia, the season kicks off early with the Scotsfestival, held aboard and alongside the Clydebank-built RMS Queen Mary at its permanent mooring in the Los Angeles suburb of Long Beach.I drove down to Scotsfestival ndash whose website, it may be worth noting, optimistically describes Clydebank as a lsquoquaint seaside townrsquo ndash on a sunny Saturday morning with The Proclaimers cranked all the way up. As Craig and Charlie lamented, lsquoAll the blood that flowed away, across the ocean to the second chancersquo, I joined in full-throatedly, even though I myself have long since become that blood.When I arrive at mid-morning, the Scotsfestival is in full swing and the Queen Mary looks resplendent in her black, red, and white Cunard stripes. There is nowhere to buy anything resembling breakfast or even coffee, but the bars are already doing a spectacular trade. Currently a month and a half into a dry , I feel asI am letting our national side down.On a field enclosed by a white picket fence, the Highland Games are already underway. A woman in a mini-kilt and Led Zeppelin T-shirt launches a hammer with such extreme power and lack of direction that it almost decapitates a nearby judge this being Southern Calornia, his only reaction is to enthusiastically high five her. The next event is an American invention that involves using a pitchfork to toss a burlap sack over a high bar. Lochaber, no more.In an adjacent area of perfectly green grass, a half dozen immaculate sheep stand aswaiting for their close-up. I take it upon myself to educate their American shepherd, Ted Thompson:he wants his sheep to look authentically Scottish he needs to muddy up their underbellies, spray paint them with a blue hieroglyphic, and ideally set them wandering loose on a country road. Ted politely explains that his sheep look this way because they are decorative sheep, bred not for wool nor meat but simply to look good while being herded. Ted has never been to Scotland, but had ancestors that came from Ayrshire. Keen to make up for my sheep faux-pas, I inform him that Ayrshire is Robert Burnsrsquo country. He is not familiar with lsquoA manrsquos a man for arsquo thatrsquo, but immediately gets the sentiment, pointing out with a wry smile that he has a friend who is a Trump supporter, and yet they manage to find mutual ground.I head next to the lsquoClydebank Crossrsquo, a tented encampment of battle re-enactors. The website promised this would provide lsquoa taste of what it means to be Scottishrsquo through its lsquowoodwork and metalwork demonstrationsrsquo. Woodwork and metalwork have never felt a strong part of my Scottish identity, but the re-enactors are at least demonstrating another of our national characteristics that I can relate to: they feel that they have been treated unfairly, and consequently are morose.Specically, they are unhappy about the location they have been assigned. It is hard to blame them: next to the portaloos and tucked behind a row of mock-Tudor structures still covered in fake snow from last seasonrsquos Winter Wonderland, their encampment will not attract much foot traffic today. They dutully clean their muskets like the good soldiers they are, but their hearts are not entirely in it, a situation they underscore by frequently setting down their muskets to show each other YouTube videos on their iphones.By the time I have wandered through the nearby lsquoVendor Valleyrsquo, my own heart is no longer entirely in it either. The concessions here sell claymores, chain-mail and pikes. The website had claimed this Vendor Valley would lsquotake you back to a Scottish marketrsquo, but it seems another outlandish hope. Perhaps you can pick up a claymore at the Barrasyou know who to ask, but surely no self-respecting Glaswegian stallholder would ever post a sign in a medieval font that proclaims they accept lsquoMaster of the Cardrsquo and lsquoLady Visarsquo.A-Z of Outlander: Everything you need to know about the hit TV showI begin to suspect that that our American cousins donrsquot love Scotland at all, but simply Braveheart and Outlander. Yetthis is the case, I can hardly blame them. Mel Gibson shouting for freedom while wearing blue face paint might be an absurd version of our country, but I mostly exist in an equally delusional version of theirs, one where Martin Sheen is President and acts on the scientic advice he gets from a wise-cracking Jeff Goldblum. This being Los Angeles, even the Queen Mary once starred in a movie, playing herself in the  flop Assault on a Queen, in which Frank Sinatra uses a salvaged Nazi U-boat to conduct an improbable heist on the grand old dame.Outlander centres around Claire Randall, a Second World War era nurse mysteriously transported back to Jacobite times. With each hour I spend at Scotsfestival, I find myself sympathising ever more with her plight. Most of the men here are wearing kilts, and those that are not are sporting T-shirts that pledge allegiance to a clan on the front while listing bloody battles on the back asthey were stadiums on a rock tour: Falkirk , Arbroath , Prestonpans .I call in at one of the T-shirt stalls, but they of course do not have anything for Stephensons. Why would they  It is an English name, and two generations back on my motherrsquos side they were all Irish, so no luck there either. I am a Scotsman that has never had a clan, and a troubling thought now strikes me: is it possible that these Calornians, with their Glengarrys and Jacobite shirts and their fierce Caledonian pride, are actually more Scottish than I am Feeling suddenly homesick, I am fortunate to find myself wandering in to the tent of lsquoClan Inebriatedrsquo. Styled as a clan for all those who do not have one, Clan Inebriatedrsquos motto is lsquoGu Deoch, Gu Cairdean, Gu Sporrsquo ndash lsquoTo drink, to friends, to funrsquo. Clan Inebriatedrsquos members pride themselves on traditional Scottish hospitality, and sure enough a whisky drink is quickly placed in my hand and I am offered a seat on a chair that turns out to also be for sale. Somebody is playing the chanter, and by the time I have finished my drink, I am a member of Clan Inebriated in every sense: dry , no more.When I bid my new kinfolk farewell, they give me another drink lsquofor the roadrsquo. They assure me this is a long-standing Highland tradition, and who am I to argue  Feeling supremely Scottish ndash and more than a little drunk ndash I board the Queen Mary where the Los Angeles Scottish Country Dancing Display Team are about to commence a demonstration. The person standing next to me asksI know Scottish dances and I ndash a proud veteran of many a late-night wedding Strip The Willow ndash confirm that I absolutely do. But then the LASCDDT proceed to dance a Founderrsquos Reel, which seems like a Strip the Willow except it also requires PhDs in Fluid Mechanics and String Theory. The dancers had all seemed to be genteel retirees, but unleashed on a dancefloor they have become the Harlem Globetrotters of Scottish Country Dancing. I leave before anybody gets the idea of making me dance.Down the corridor, a bar has been converted to evoke lsquoa cosy pub in Edinburghrsquos old townrsquo. They have got it spot on, right down to the dingy lighting and the folk musicians annoyed at being talked over. The first item on the pub menu is Haggis, Neeps and Tatties and I cannot resist asking the barmanit is popular. \"People love to hear about it,\" he begins, diplomatically, lsquoAnd they even love to see it too. They just donrsquot actually want to eat it, and usually end up going to the Starbucks on the next deck.\"I slip disgracefully away to Starbucks, order my iced oat milk latte and bagel and head out on to the deck to enjoy them. They are both delicious, but I notice undernotes of shame and betrayal. Still, as I sit there, I hear the familiar rat-a-tat of a snare drum and then the first skirl of the pipes. And soon the sound hits me, the way it always does right in my Scottish heart. I hurry back down to the dockside to see who is making this beautul noise, to find out which storied regimental band are visiting from Scotland.But they are not a regiment, nor soldiers, nor even adults. They are the teenagers of the local Glendora High School Pipe Band. They look resplendent in Royal Stewart kilts, dress black waistcoats and brogues. The music is note perfect, their Scotland the Brave the most rousing I have ever heard. And yet the most wonderful part is the band themselves: they are Angelenos of all heritages, and they are playing our music as well as I have ever heard even though I grew up within earshot of the Edinburgh military tattoo. A proud parent nearby tells me the band have been invited to the world championships in Glasgow this summer they can raise the funds for accommodation. Before they have finished the first tune, I am texting my mother to askshe has room for an entire pipe band.Feeling happier and more proudly Scottish than I have all day, I tour the stalls of the Clan societies. As far as I can fathom, these are groups which allow Americans with Scottish names to fraternise with their fellow MacLeods, MacMillans and Mackintoshes, assharing a surname with a stranger was a bond rather than a mild inconvenience. Clan McPherson have the best branding ndash an emblem of a wildcat, and the motto lsquoTouch not the cat but with a gloversquo ndash and I am therefore disappointed to see that I cannot even claim any of the affiliated surnames listed on their stand. Still, I note that list includes lsquoSmithrsquo, and so I diplomatically suggest to the two American women running the stall that including the most common surname in Britain suggests that Clan McPherson are perhaps not too fussy, and maybe they could therefore affiliate a Stephenson too.Predictably, I am wrong. They explain to me how in  the McPhersons arranged a -man battle with their comrades the Davidsons over the issue of who would stand where during the forthcoming battle with their actual enemy, the Camerons. When the McPhersons arrived a man short for this spectator-sport rammy, a local blacksmith in the audience stepped in, sportingly killed more than his allocation of Davidsons, and hence to this day McPhersons consider all Smiths undisputed kin. This, I tell them, is undoubtedly the most Scottish thing I have ever heard.Both women are regulars on the Scottish Festival circuit ndash Santa Rosa is next in the calendar, followed by Sacramento ndash and so I ask them just what the attraction is. They immediately talk of the bagpipes, and describe the exact feeling I had at the dockside earlier: \"I want to cry when I hear them, I canrsquot even explain it, it strikes something so deep of longing and loss.\"They then go on to talk about the communion the festivals themselves provide: \"Itrsquos like finding lots and lots of distant cousins. It fills this niche inside of us that wants us to feel connected with something that is longer than our own history here in America.\" Not for the first time today, I feel a little churlish for ever having found such earnestly-held affection anything other than profound.At five orsquoclock, the Pipes and Drums prizegiving is held, and the Glendora High School Pipe Band rightly sweep the board. Over in the main field, the Highland Games have progressed to tossing the beer keg which may or may not be an officially-sanctioned event. Down on the dockside, the disgruntled re-enactors have finally taken matters into their own hands and wheeled their cannons out to perform their final display of musket and cannon fire where they can be properly appreciated. The location they have selected is the entrance to the bagpiperrsquos staging area, and the rammy that results would make our own country proud. Kilted pipers yell at musket-wielding soldiers, and for a while it seems like a minor war might break out in the late afternoon. Ancient shouts of \"Fire down!\" and \"Misfire!\" mingle with more modern and less printable ones. It all feels wonderfully Scottish nobody provokes us with impunity, and we do truly love a good stramash.Back at the herding pen, Ted Thompsonrsquos sheep-herding display is now in full flow, his border collie bringing out the best in his Hollywood-ready sheep. He asks the audience to considerhis dog is enjoying his work we all look and see that Tedrsquos dog is not just enjoying it, but undeniably grinning. Ted then talks about the herding instinct and how some border collies are born with it, and some are not. It is, he says, as simple as that:you want to herd sheep you are a sheepdog, andyou do not want to herd sheep, then you are not a sheepdog.It occurs to me than that perhaps this is what it is to be Scottish too: an instinct. Andyou feel that instinct,the skirl of the pipes stirs your blood, you are Scottish. We are, by heritage and by choice, an inclusive people, so it seems fitting that being Scottish should not be much to do with being born in Scotland or having Scottish parents or even ancestors, and perhaps not even much to do with ever having lived there. Maybe being Scottish is a choice, and one that all the bekilted Calornians wandering around Scotsfestival today have got right.Now the sun begins to set, bathing the RMS Queen Mary in golden light. Children battle their siblings with plastic claymores, the Scotch Egg concession posts a sign saying Everything Sold Completely Out and the implausibly good-looking sheep are loaded on to their tractor trailer. On a stage, the singer of a folk-rock band talks about how he and the Queen Mary were both born in Glasgow but have somehow washed up here together, and then he launches into the Skye Boat Song.It initially draws a loud cheer from the crowd, but they are quickly transported in to a reverie, and so am I. I am thinking of long-ago childhood holidays, trying to spot dolphins off the CalMac ferry and a peat fire in a drafty cottage in Lamlash. They, presumably, are mostly thinking about Claire Randall, because the Skye Boat song also happens to be the theme music for Outlander. Skye no more, then, and yet it does not matter: the song was anyway written a century after the events it claims to depict, and the lyrics were subsequently rewritten by Robert Louis Stevenson before being altered to better fit Claire Randallrsquos story. Here again, though, their version of being Scottish is just as good and as valid as mine, and perhaps more so, because it is even more inclusive. Whorsquos like us  Everybody that wants to be. We are, after all, all Jock Tamsonrsquos bairns.Set My Heart to Five, by Simon Stephenson, is out now on th Estate.

He then fails to make the connection between lack of these scarce resources with \"draconian laws to enforce an ill-advised blanket lockdown\". The lockdown followed the scarcity as night follows day.There is no mention in the professors letter of the elephant in the room, which may well have been peeking over his shoulder as he wrote. The complete lack of preparedness within the NHS and the private care home sector to handle a surge of infections was the driver for the lockdown. The question which must be answered is why we were so badly prepared, and the answer is staring us in the face, or perhaps even standing beside us in the room  years of Westminster-driven austerity left the NHS so stretched that our resources in every area, PPE to ventilators, were lacking, that is why \"the draconian laws\" to enforce lockdown were required.At least Prof Ennos eventually comes to a cogent solution, and I make no apologies for quoting him: \"The time has come for the Scottish Government to admit past mistakes, pluck up its courage and lead us out of this grotesque lockdown so that we can live in a Scotland where risk is present but pragmatically managed, and our economy, education, culture and inidualism can thrive.\"Quite so.

Aside from the index case who brought the virus to the conference, anyone exposed on the th or th of February would be expected, therefore, to exhibit symptoms at the earliest around March and, at the latest, about March . Most likely, many cases were presenting somewhere in between, so it is highly likely that, as early as March  , only a suspicion of an outbreak could have been forming, given most cases would have developed later. Maybe the early contacts were colleagues who had journeyed to the conference with the index case and who, thus, were exposed earlier. Mr Mackay doesnt know and neither do I, but the recognition of the fullness of the outbreak would not have happened until much later.As a retired consultant in microbiology infection control, it irritated me back then when dealing with infection outbreaks, and it still irritates me now, to read such speculative nonsense spouted in the press, usually nowhere near the truth, when the actuality is that a dedicated team will have been working their socks off to control this incident and protect the public.

The population occupies breeding grounds eastwards from Scandinavia towards Siberia.The dotterel is unusual in that it turns the tables on traditional gender roles. The brightly-coloured females lead in courtship before leaving the smaller, drabber males to incubate the eggs and raise the young, and for this reason the species has been counted by the number of breeding males rather than pairs. There are only about - breeding males in the Uk.A new study published by Global Change Biology explores the potential ways that changing environmental conditions may be driving the decline and has found limited evidence that the decline in breeding is driven by climate change of dotterels.It research focuses on snow cover and nitrogen deposition. The amount of snow-cover is important for cold-adapted species of plants and animals.Fewer snow patches, around which dotterel feed, may lead to a reduction in peak insect abundance for chicks and cause unsuitable higher vegetation.Higher deposition of nitrogen tends to result in a reduction of alpine specialist plants, including species of mosses that form key breeding habitats for dotterel.Population declines and site abandonment by dotterel in Scotland during the last three decades have largely occurred at lower elevations, suggesting climate change may be the cause.However, the new study found relatively limited evidence that the decline in the breeding population is being driven by climatic factors on the breeding grounds, despite it previously being mooted as the primary reason.\"Climate change and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition are widely regarded as important drivers of environmental change in alpine habitats. However, due to the dficulties working in high-elevation mountain systems, the impacts of these drivers on alpine breeding species have rarely been investigated,\" the study said.\"The Eurasian dotterelis a migratory wader, which has been the subject of uniquely long-term and spatially widespread monitoring effort in Scotland, where it breeds in alpine areas in dwindling numbers.\"Here we analyse data sets spanning three decades, to investigate whether key potential drivers of environmental change in Scottish mountainshave contributed to the population decline of dotterel.\"We also consider the role of rainfall on the species wintering grounds in North Africa.The study said: \"We found dotterel declines in both density and site occupancy of breeding males primarily occurred on low and intermediate elevation sites.\"High-elevation sites mostly continued to be occupied, but males occurred at lower densities in years following snow-rich winters, suggesting high-elevation snow cover displaced dotterel to lower sites.\"Wintering ground rainfall was positively associated with densities of breeding males two springs later.\"Dotterel densities were reduced at low and intermediate sites where nitrogen deposition was greatest, but not at high-elevation sites.\"While climatic factors explained iation in breeding density between years, they did not seem to explain the species uphill retreat and decline.ldquoWe cannot rule out the possibility that dotterel have increasingly settled on higher sites previously unavailable due to extensive snow cover, while changes associated with nitrogen deposition may also have rendered lower lying sites less suitable for breeding."},{"url":null,"title":"wigtown-festival-moves-online-2020","story":"The Wigtown Book Festival

The AP analysis is based on metrics developed by Hard Universityrsquos Global Health Institute.Hard researchers have calculated the US needs to test at least , people daily to reopen the economy safely, nearly three times the current tally of about ,, according to figures compiled by the Covid Tracking Project website.Among the states falling short are Texas and Georgia, which have reopened shopping centres, barbers, and other businesses.Dr Ashish Jha, director of Hardrsquos Global Health Institute, said: ldquoI really do feel there are dangers here to opening up without enough tests, but I donrsquot feel itrsquos a unorm danger everywhere in the country.New York state is moving more cautiously, allowing smaller cities and rural regions spared the brunt of the outbreak to reopen first.The first wave will include retail ndash though only for kerb-side or in-store pick-up ndash along with construction and manufacturing.New York governor Andrew Cuomo has also said beaches will reopen in time for next weekendrsquos Memorial Day holiday.In South Korea, which has one of the highest levels of testing, a health ministry spokesman said on Saturday that the country may have dodged a major outbreak after finding  cases linked to clubgoers in Seoul, the densely populated capital.Son Young-rae said , people have been tested in the club-related outbreak.ldquoItrsquos notable there were no new transmissions in churches, call centres and gyms where virus carriers went to, he said, adding that is a sign facilities and businesses are practising proper hygiene and enforcing distance between people.China is shortening its annual legislative session, which begins next week in Beijing, as small clusters of cases pop up where in the country. The spread of the disease has largely stopped in the country where the pandemic started, but Jilin province in the north-east has reported  cases over nine days, the latest two on Friday.In Mexico, the number of new confirmed cases hit a new daily high on Friday, even as the government claried guidelines for the construction, mining and automotive industries to start ing to work next week.The country recorded more than , cases for the second day in a row, suggesting its outbreak has yet to peak."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmADVERTORIAL: GP surgeries and hospitals are still here for you.

This includes the establishment of a joint ministerial committee to discuss the ongoing pandemic and its management.A statement, released this afternoon, Thursday, on behalf of Alistair Carmichael MP and Lord Jim Wallace of Tankerness said: “Across the country, people are worried about their loved ones and their jobs in light of coronavirus – and they are getting mixed messages from governments.”In a time of crisis, confusion and inconsistency breed fear and put people at risk. A collective approach could help to restore public confidence that our leaders are pulling together.This is not about dropping blame at anyone’s door. The reality however is that in recent days and weeks, attempts to formulate responses to the coronavirus are more notable for apparent disagreements between national governments than for policy substance. We need governments to build consensus and create a shared responsibility across the UK.”We are calling for a more joined up response to what is a cross-governmental challenge – by establishing a coronavirus Joint Ministerial Committee “A coronavirus JMC with an enhanced remit, meeting regularly and with an approach based on consensus and shared responsibility would help to reduce disputes, with all governments involved in developing plans.”It would help to refocus coronavirus response based on national and regional needs rather than political borders. This solution could help reduce the chaos of the current political climate – and point the way towards a better long-term crisis response mechanism in future.”We believe that an enhanced JMC for the coronavirus crisis is the right way to give people confidence in their governments during this time – with a message that leaders are working with, rather than against each other.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But that#s got to come from the islands themselves.#I#m not trying to say it will happen, at all, but it#s a live discussion.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This had been planned for March before the coronavirus pandemic broke out.Sweyn Johnston is the council’s strategic projects director. He said: “We are very disappointed that we have been unable to carry out a public event in Hoy.#The previous event that we held in Hoy, and indeed public events we have held where in Orkney during the project, have been very beneficial in meeting with the public to talk about Orkney’s Community Wind Farm Project.“The emergency legislation passed by the Scottish Government is vital in keeping projects on track to support our future economic and societal recovery, businesses and jobs and avoiding delays to infrastructure and other developments.“It’s really important to us that members of the public are offered the best opportunity possible under the current circumstances to make their views known about the plans so that we can consider this before we submit our application.#We have worked hard to develop a consultation plan which gives as much flexibility as possible to allow folk to provide that input and are hopeful for a high level of participation.”The council intends to submit a planning application later this year.The project is part of a project which also includes proposed wind farm developments at Quanterness and on Faray in the North Isles.The development will consist of up to six turbines with a maximum blade-tip height of .m, access tracks, crane hardstandings, turbine foundations, underground cabling, on-site substation and maintenance building, a temporary construction compound, potential excavations borrow workings and a permanent meteorological mast.The objective of the PAC is for communities to be better informed about major and national development proposals and to have an opportunity to contribute their views before a formal planning application is submitted to the planning authority.It should be noted that comments made to OIC through this PAC process are not representations to the planning authority. If a planning application is subsequently submitted, neighbour notication and publicity will be undertaken, and iniduals and communities will have an opportunity to make representations on that application to the planning authority at that time.To discuss options for speaking to the project team please contact Kirsty Groundwater, Project Officer, Orkney Islands Council by email on kirsty.groundwater@orkney.gov.uk or by phone on . The deadline for submitting comments to the project team is Monday, June , at pm.Comments can be submitted through:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England.

It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

Corona is incubated in the wider community.There are certain places where you do not want the virus to end up, because the death rates are bound to be very highit gets in there, and care homes are the most dangerous place of all.The failing in this case lies in the lack of oversight within Scotland, andwe are to learn anything from this, it is important that responsibility is fully and accurately apportioned.The Scottish Government have tried to say that care home owners themselves have been negligent.If this is the case, then anyone catching the virus since the outset must also be in some way negligent, orthey contracted it in a public institution, then it must have been negligent.Such is the downward spiral that arises when government chooses not to look at itself but wants to find some-one  to blame., Aberfeldy I would like to remind all reporters that Home Farm was a particular home at risk due to its persistent failure in even basic Infection Control Procedures.This has been evident since November . Their last inspection gave them a grade of  Where were the NHS and Social Services staff in making sure this home improved to an acceptable level before the outbreak  in relation to the horric impact the virus has had with a nursing home in Skye.I#m a little confused by some of your assertions, that suggest the UK Government are responsible.The National Health Service is  per cent devolved in Scotland and the private health care of nursing homes come under the regulation of the Scottish Government.Surely your points would be better addressed to the Scottish Government who are responsible and accountable for the support of care homes during this pandemic Kindly note that the SNP administration have admitted that patients were sent to care homes without the results of the Cov- tests being known.Ms Freeman was interviewed early by the BBC and admitted this point. It is also worth noting that the SNP have stated care homes will pay for the non-standard PPE issued by the Scottish Government.Not something I believe is entirely reasonable, given this being a global pandemic and the regulations enforced by the Government.Rest assured, our thoughts are with the victims of this horric virus. I hope accountability is aligned to where it resides here in Scotland. re Home Farm Nursing Home is not only inaccurate it is totally biased.I have a simple question for you#. the SNP and that woman Sturgeon are not responsible for anything why then do we need them So no doubt you will give them credit without hesitation but when truth and correct fact is required you cannot bring yourself to name and shame and there is indeed plenty to shame them for , including this.Perhaps your reporting needs closer scrutiny in future.I am disabled and use a rollator to get around. On Thursday last week I hurt my back and couldn#t walk even with the rollator.I needed to buy some food but discovered the co-op doesn#t do home delivery. They used to, but not anymore.I tried Skye community response and they put me on to the warehouse which is mainly vegetables.I found there was nowhere to turn to and was getting exasperated. Along with the pain it wasn#t doing me any good.My doctor suggested I increase the morphine that I#m already on to seethat helps.I#m angry that there is no help for people like me.The co-op could easily do home delivery. I don#t know why they don#t.The co-op could allow disabled people to go straight in and not stand in a queue and I mean disabled people # not the ones who can walk perfectly with a walking stick and have somehow managed to get a blue badge .There should be something in place to help people like me without having to go through reams of red tape.Meanwhile I#m just about out of bread and milk andit wasn#t for the kind actions of a neighbour I would be stuffed.Why isn#t there something in place for these who find themselves in a situation like mine. Andthere is then why is it being kept a secret last week reminded me that about  years ago, as part of the Their Past Your Future project, the Museum of the Isles at Clan Donald and the Archive Service in Portree collaborated on an oral history project relating to the second world war in Skye.One of the outcomes was a book The Crofters and the War, using excerpts from the many hours of recordings that were made, mainly by Mary Carmichael who was the project officer.The book included a chapter on the surrender. There were quotes from Annie MacLean of Raasay, and from Ruth Coghill, Vi Beaton, and Mary Black, who all remembered seeing the surrender, as well as a photo of German sailors at Kyle station which is in the Archive service collections.I seem to remember that Mary Carmichael located a film of part of the surrender, as I remember watching it, but I am afraid I can#t remember where it originated # maybe the Imperial War museum, maybe the Scottish Film Archive.There were probably many other references to submarine activity and the end of the war where in the book, and also in the actual recordings.I can#t remember whether both the Museum and the Archive service kept copies of the recordings, or whether it was just one of them.Every contributor got a copy of the book, as did local schools, and it was also for sale so you may have come across a copy.

With performers stuck at home as venues have closed - and unlikely to open again until the fth stage of the NI Executive#s plan to exit lockdown, the Covid- crisis has left many performers struggling both financially and mentally.But actress Debra Hill is determined to keep the creative side of her le alive, and with the help of colleagues who are also out of work for the time being, has crafted an uplting video she hopes will put a smile on peoples faces.Debrasaid the reaction to her effort has been overwhelmingly positive.The best reaction I#ve heard is that it#s heart-warming, and heartbreaking, she said. That just about sums it up perfectly.We#re all in the same boat, she said. It was actually quite scary, when I started this a couple of weeks ago, to see so many come back to me with videos of their lines and they were from pantos last Christmas. It#s almost half a year since a lot of performers have been able to work on stage.All our careers have been left on the back burner for now, and that#s proving dficult. For me, it feels good to create at home. I know not everyone is the same. But having been involved in a couple of small projects with Tinderbox Theatre, I thought I#d try to engage with some others who have been left kicking their heels,they felt up to it.Considering how long it had been since any of us were actually able to get out there in front of an audience, I thought it would be interesting to see what the last line each of them had spoken was.I thought I#d maybe get one or two replies, but they came flooding in. Putting them together helped my creative side, and hopefully has given one or two of them, and a few other people out there, a bit of a laugh.That some of them got dressed up in character was lovely. I really hope it helped them, and from the feedback I#ve been getting, it has, which is what it was all about.The faces getting involved will be familiar to many around the arts scene.We have to try to stay as positive as possible. We know the situation and that, even for rehearsals, we#ll be waiting a longer time than most to get back out there working again.What#s been keeping me going is the little online projects with companies like Spanner in the Works and working with the kids on Saturday when I teach online with Belfast School of Performing Arts.Those little things keep you going, but for so many more who are used to getting on stage, the sudden ending of that, being stuck at home with little to do and no source of income, has been tremendously dficult.But the videos show we#re all still here. We#re getting through in our own ways, in our own homes. Mental health is important andthe message to fellow performers out there that they#re not alone gets through in an amusing way, putting even a little smile on a face or two along the way, then it#s been worthwhile.She added: I know I speak for everyone who took part by saying we#re all so looking forward to being able to get back out there on stage and entertaining.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandBehind-the-scenes team navigating Northern Ireland out of crisisThis is the group of little-known but influential people who are leading the way in charting our response and roadmap amid the coronavirus pandemic.GalleryMotorcyclingGlenn Irwin: #I#m cycling up the north coast with a strong headwind and it#s as close as I will get to NW this year#We are asking our sporting personalities how they are dealing with action coming to a halt because of the coronavirus pandemic and how it has affected their daily lives.Most ReadI#ll never play golf with Donald Trump again, vows Rory McIlroyBittersweet homecoming for virus survivor Geoffrey McKillop as he hears lelong friend and her daughter died in quad bike crashNI nurse pays tribute to #fearless# doctor husband who died after contracting Covid- while working aged Zoom #security concerns# force Northern Ireland school to stop using app, claims principalDevastated Ryan Smyth heard bang from crash that killed we Clare and little Bethany ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tuesday saw the ninth edition of the County Derry Post without a match report, without an athletics update and without any kind of preview. Getting bogged down in feature and nostalgia pieces gives sports journalists the opportunity to chat with characters and legends from yesteryear. It is the perfect therapy. Living and working in isolation, is just how le is at the moment. You appreciate a daily run and the chirping birds all the more. Every day seems the same, but some things are dotted in to keep the week structured. googletag.cmd.push Joe McCloskey hosts a zoom quiz for our circle of friends, so that means it is Saturday at .pm. Fr Doherty delivers mass via the webcam, so that means it is Sunday morning at . and proofing pages means it is Monday and deadline time. Our daughter Erins school, St Brigids   Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted in Tirkane, have been excellent at rolling out enough work to keep her engaged. I play Muacuteinteoir Daidaiacute and set out a few tasks. Not a lot, but just enough to maintain some sort of structure. There is so much out there that is learning, the practical stuff. My we Pauline took her on a nature walk to pick wild flowers for a May altar. Granny Sally is teaching her how to grow tomatoes and the treehouse, crafted by Granda Mickey, is getting well tested. And all the teddies made an appearance in the garden to make a zoo, as shown in the picture above. googletag.cmd.push It is just great to be able to spend time with your family. Then one evening came a statement that just stopped me in my tracks. “Daddy, when this is all over, can we go to that Kitchen place in Magherafelt for a chocolate milkshake,” Erin asked. Her this is the coronavirus and she is talking about Shorty McNallyscafe, a hub of chat. Erin always get a milkshake and I get the half and half with chicken curry that always hits the spot. Erin follows up: “Daddy...when will this all be over ” “I dont know pet,” comes my answer. And I dont. I feel tiny and helpless. At this stage, the penny drops. What must be going on in their wee heads  The schoolwork is irrelevant. They will all catch-up sometime. A cuddle and some reassurance that you are there for them is more important. Every Thursday night, a round of applause is dedicated to those working in the NHS and on front line. But me, my thoughts are also dedicated to the children out there. They have also been thrust into a whole world of uncertainty. God love them. One thing is certain though...Shortys next serving of milkshake and curry will never taste better.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

As the attention ed to the main news, the reporter laughed in recognition. “Oh I know it very well, I used to go to the discos there,” she explained. That level of cultural reach does not happen overnight, nor without a huge effort from volunteers within the club. Current chairperson, Sean McGuigan, was on the committee when the disco began in  and said running the disco was a huge undertaking. “You really had to put your le on hold, because on a Friday night you couldn’t go anywhere,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “You had to go up the road to the hall. You could have had  or more people there. Evenyou didn’t go, you felt a bit guilty in case something happened and you weren’t there. “I can laugh about it now, but it was a very busy time. You were away out about half ,  o’clock and you wouldn’t have got back ‘til nearly  or  o’clock in the morning.”  Keen to enlist parental support in south Derry and beyond, the club pulled out all the stops, placing bouncers on the bus and manning the hall with vigilance. googletag.cmd.push The plan, on the whole, was a success and reams of teenagers packed the buses every Friday night to make the journey to Emmet Park. “I think parents knew that their weans were being bussed to the disco and home again,” said Sean. “There was no drink allowed on the bus, we took it off them before they got on. Parents bought into that, that they were being looked after when they came to Slaughtneil, which they were. “We had a fella Hugh Convery, God rest him. Standing on the floor he was ft  or so, maybe more. Once he stood up on to the brown chairs, people came in, saw big Hugh and they never moved!”  Securing reliable transport for the hundreds of young people who attended Slaughtneil was crucial to its success, which surprised many of the club’s members. “We met the bus people and went with the bus to certain towns,” said Sean. “I remember one night I saw the lights of the bus showing a sign for Donemana and I said to John Joe Kearney ‘Jesus John Joe, we’re a long way from home’. “Henry Kearney used to have to go out some Saturday mornings to Bobby McLaughlin or some of the bus men to keep them quiet!” On some occasions, Monday night committee meetings were taken up entirely by the business of organising the following Friday’s disco. In the late s and early s, two groups of boisterous young men from dferent parts of south Derry were causing the club a few headaches. “There used to be a couple of gangs from south Derry,” recalled Sean. “One was called the Banana Gang and they were from Bellaghy. The other was the Gorilla Gang and they were from Draperstown or Ballinascreen. “Those two gangs’ names would have been mentioned at our meetings every Monday night! The main part of the meeting was always about the disco and who was on on Friday night. “There was the odd wee scrap, and we had to throw the odd boy out for misbehaving, but when you think back now, they weren’t doing a wile lot of harm. “I remember when I was going to dances around Ardboe and the Castle and places like that and there were riots, really bad fights. There was never anything like that at our disco.”  The club’s coffers were rapidly expanding with every passing week, but, as the saying goes,you’re standing still, you’re moving backwards, and the disco had to evolve. That evolution wasn’t just focused on what was happening on the stage or in the hall. “We had to stamp them,” said Sean. “I remember children coming in saying they were paying for three people, throwing the fiver in, and not even waiting for their change. “I had to go to Donegal Pass to meet a fella to buy all these stampers, but the youngsters were getting the stamp and going back out and stamping all their friends when it was still wet! “We learned a lot. We stopped letting the children out until a certain time from the hall to stop it. “They used to try and spice it up too. Some nights they would have a foam party, or give out free Walkmans – they were pound a piece back then! Other nights, breakdancers came and danced through the hall.”  Having done a twenty-year stretch, and resulted in several marriages, the disco finally began to peter out in the mid-s. Attendances fell as teenagers’ choices of entertainment became more erse, and the club eventually pulled the plug. Sean McGuigan says the club can look back on that period with pride as an era in which their collective shoulder was firmly to the wheel. “You actually couldn’t do it now. There were some nights in there that the hall was jammed,” he said. “I’m not sure what took over, I saw some nights where there were only  in the hall. Everyone’s batteries got flat and then they stopped it. “A lot of us were glad it was all over, because it was hectic, but it made us a lot of money. It was only a pound in, which is pittance, but it was that big a crowd. “You were taking in around pound a week and on big nights, you could have got pound,. “There was a fair wee bit of pride went into it because the only time the price went up was for a late night. “At the meetings, people used to discuss raising the price, but the attitude was ‘we’re not going to destroy the goose that laid the golden egg’.” The teenagers of  move in a dferent era to those that went before them, who are probably glad that the walls of Slaughtneil hall are mute. “You actually couldn’t do it now,” said Sean. He’s probably right.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

Its just after lunch last Friday afternoon and Colm Mulholland rolls back the years. Seated in his Lavey home, he surveys across the South Derry landscape.Theres not a cloud in the sky, as clear as Colms voice coming down the phone.“I can even pick out the Carn and Slaughtneil from here,” utters the  year-old.Its the picturesque landscape his we Mairead, nee OConnell, spent a lot of her childhood in, at her Granny and Granda McKennas in Tirkane and a panorama she can view every day.Maireads late brother Sean lit up the attack in Derrys  All-Ireland final team, while her future husband Colm was the defensive linchpin.Over  years later, Colm is content. Football and golf, the sports he gave much of his le to, are etched consistently through the conversation.“I feel quite good, but I wouldnt just like to be walking too far,” Colm offers.Five years ago, he acquired a golf buggy – complete with flashing neon orange light - to help him navigate his way around the parish.“I can still play a bit of golf, but this coronavirus has put an end to that.” he continues.One afternoon, Fergal Shorty McNally was lining out Lavey bottom pitch. Down the hill came Colms buggy, before he got out and swung his driver. Ping. The ball went  yards up the pitch.Colm would regularly call in at the pitch, to run his eye over whatever game or training session was going on.Sport still figures highly in his thoughts.The upcoming Lavey underage are quite good, he comments before inquisitively enquiring of another opinion on their quality. He listens intently, happy that the clubs latest crop have potential. googletag.cmd.push *** Colms father Daniel married Bellaghy woman Elizabeth Glackin and brought up a family of nine, in the townland of Ballymacpeake.After getting married, Colm moved to Ballinascreen, where Mairead taught. He bought the Burnside Innin the town, farmed nearby in Moneyneana and was getting his own contracting business off the ground.He later ed to the outskirts of Gulladuff, renovated the house where they raised four children – Don, Sinead, Martin and Brid.Colm won a scholarship to attend St Columbs in Derry. However, with a farm in the family, he didnt take up the offer.“I went into the civil engineering business,” Colm outlines. “I had a lot of men employed at that time, I bought machines when I was young. It was the type of work that suited me very well. There was a lot of road jobs with heavy and light machinery, you had to have good machinery.”After that, Colm got into horticulture and harvesting of peat in Gortnahey. His son Don remembers spending summers up there.“I can remember me and a few of the McGurks going up to work there, it was around the time of the  World Cup,” he recalls. “It was like our mid-season training.”Aside from work, football became an important part of Colms le. Lavey beat Newbridge in the  senior final but had the title stripped due to allegations of someone watching a soccer game during the ban on foreign sports.They went one better a year later with a - to - win over Pearses and the clubs championship tradition was up and running. For Colm Mulholland, his football career began in his early teenage years.“I started football when I was very young,” he begins. “The earliest memory I can think of was on a Lavey team, when someone didnt come and they were a man short.“Someone said theres a young boy Mulholland there and they filled out the team. I was about  and I played on the senior team.“Fr Carragher was a big man in the GAA at the time, he came to my house and asked my fatherI could to come and play a game.“I remember the game was played in Lavey and it was a time when a lot of people were going to games on bicycles. My father had one of the first cars in Lavey parish.”Lavey won championships in  and , but by the time Colm had become a regular senior, it was Newbridge who began to take root.“I was a young player coming up through with Lavey and enjoying my football. We werent winning all the time, but we were winning some things.“I had myself all prepared and like a lot of others, I was physically very fit. You werent worried about who you met.“At that time, Newbridge had a great side and were ruling the roost, they were winning everything.”Going into the s, Colm, the  Derry minor captain had established himself on the senior team and, locally, Lavey was beginning to flourish. In , they opened their hall. The following year, Lavey won the league and championship double and just missed out on the treble when Newbridge beat them in the final of the McGlinchey Cup.“I was the captain of the Lavey team that won the  championship,” Colm says proudly.With the lateTommy Doherty at centre-back, Colm was deployed on the  by manager John L Fay, who was ahead of his time as a manager, having taken the Lavey team to watch Banaghers North Derry final win over Dungiven two weeks before the county decider.The all-county final was played in Dungiven and they went into the chapel to light a candle before the game and it had the desired effect. On a windy day, they beat Banagher - to - to secure the clubs fourth title. googletag.cmd.push  Colmcaptained Lavey to the  senior championship “It was a great le,” Colm said of his football career, having played with Lavey until around . “I must say that I enjoyed every bit of it. I played with some very good players in my time and came up against some very good players.”When Lavey became a force at the end of the s, his son Don was on the team. He played up front with Seamus Downey and Collie McGurk on the team that won the  All-Ireland.“That was a very proud moment, there is no doubt about that,” Colm utters.Don can remember the fitting moment when he was reunited with his father after their win over Salthill.“Daddy and uncle Seanwere there on the pitch and I can remember their joy,” he outlines. “It was like the feeling of at last weve won something in Croke Park and something signicant and a monkey off the back.”The irony was the that great friends from their Lavey and Derry days Colm and Short Tommys sons – Don and Damian – played in Laveys finest hour.It was the missing link, giving Derry the extra belief that Sam Maguire was in their grasp. Colm agrees.“It was a fantastic...and Henry Downey was a great player,” he endorsed of the man following in his own footsteps.“Lavey were always to the fore, with players on Derry teams,” added Colm, who was one of the standard bearers. *** When Derry won the first NFL title in , John L Fay had moved to county management and while Colm was too young to play, he remembers that era clearly.Six points from captain Pat Keenan and a goal from Frankie Niblock, who lost three teeth in an earlier challenge, was enough to see off Clare.“Thatwas before my time. There were some of the greatest names to play Gaelic football on that team.”Three years later, Colm had broken into the county junior side that lost an All-Ireland final to Mayo. He lined out at midfield with Mickey McNaught, who was on the league winning team and Jim McKeever was listed at wing-forward. Tommy Doherty was stationed at full-back, in front of goalkeeper Charlie Moran.“I always remember them saying about Daddy being able to use both feet,” Don points out. “Thats why he played in so many dferent positions.”The junior team was for players who had not played in the senior championship during the season or the previous year.“Lesser teams have appeared in All-Ireland senior semi-finals since,” read a line from the  Derry centenary book, highlighting the strength of the  junior team.For Colm Mulholland, he just took all in his stride.“You just played the game and you didnt worry who you were playing against. You worriedyou lost andyou won it, you enjoyed it and that was the kind of le young people enjoyed.”When Derry lost their first Ulster final in , Colm was listed at corner-forward. They lost - to - to Cavan and the final to Tyrone two years later, but were no longer looked on as the soft touch in Ulster.“At that stage we all had great experience of county football. We had not won anything of great importance, but along came victory,” he said, referring to their  Ulster title and a first for the county.Early in the season, Colm was on the Derry team to play at the Wembley tournament before an attendance of , against Galway.Derry won both the Dr McKenna and Dr Lagan cups that season. In the championship, they were three-point winners against Antrim. After defeating Cavan in the semi-final, they were - to - winners against Down in the Ulster final.It took Derry back to Croke Park and a clash with a Kerry team who boasted greats such as Mick ODwyer and Mick OConnell.“That was a very big thing,” Colm states. “I remember it was a wet day and that was a much talked about game.”In dficult conditions, the Kingdom led - to -, but by half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead.The Oakleafers went into a four point lead before Kerry grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on to win narrowly, - to -.“Beating Kerry in Croke Park was some achievement, there was over , people there. You were treated like royalty when you played on that Derry team and people wouldve kissed the ground you walked on.”  Colmat a Derry training camp at the airfield in Newbridge. His daughter Brid had it blown up and original hangs on the kitchen wall at home The final was a dferent story. Dublin led - to - at one point in the first half and after Derry found their feet, they trailed by four at half-time.A goal from Owen Gribbin levelled the game at - to -, but the Dubs found the net with a Des Ferguson goal in the next attack, putting them on their way to a - to - victory.“We shouldve won that All-Ireland,” Colm states.As the years have passed, several Derry supporters have felt aggrieved at not getting fair play. On an occasion, Don went to Dublin for a weekend. A conversation with a Dub over breakfast traversed towards football and eventually of his father playing in the  final.“I remember a Dublin man chipping in telling me we robbed you that day and that the refereewas an auctioneer in Dublin and he gave us everything that day...that was a Dublin man saying that. Anyone I have talked to and is old enough to remember, would say the same.”For Colm, when speaking of the final, there is a frustrated tone, but he just wants to forget about it.“It was a good team we had, but we dont want to hear about it again, thats how bad we all took it. I am just drawing a line under it.”He played for another three or four years before calling time on his Derry career, one he enjoyed immensely. It included the  league final defeat to Kerry, a game Colm excelled in.“I played football for Lavey and Derry for at least  years. I played for a long time and then golf took over after the football.”“I just loved it football and the people you would meet, then you went down South and they knew you played Gaelic football, there was always great chat.”Colm also had a prolonged spell in Philadelphia where he stayed with his uncle Dermot Glackin, a relation on his mothers side. He also had his fare paid to travel to play football in New Yorks Gaelic Park. While in the Big Apple he got approached about playing in San Francisco and drove thejourney of nearly , miles along the famed Route .“I was in America a few times. I was well looked after and it was a very interesting time,” he adds.In later le, in , he crossed the Atlantic with his we Mairead on San Francisco, where he also played golf.He would go on to captain Moyola Park in , but it was far from his first impact on the club.  Colm in his Moyola captains jacket In the early s, there was an attempt to bring golf to the South Derry area, but it wasnt until  that Lord Moyola made an approach about about constructing a course on the Shanemullagh Estate in Castledawson.On the first committee formed was Colm Mulholland who was contractor for the new course, putting his civil engineering work to good use. By the spring of , the front nine was complete before work moved to completing the rest of the course.“I built the course – the greens and the tees,” outlines Mulholland. Being at the coalface of making the dream into a reality is a source of pride for him. Moyola was his arena and there was even a hole called after him – Colms dillemna.Earlier in the day, before our telephone call, Colm amassed all his golfing trophies. It amounted to  or  from a career he thoroughly enjoyed. He also loves to tell of his part in a fourball that lost just twice over a  year period.“I enjoyed the golf and I played it in America and played a good bit in San Francisco. Later on in le, I had more success in golf than I had on the football field.”“You could write books galore about the acquaintances with people in the world of sport. I have played golf in  of the  counties, it was great to meet friends through it and the football. Sport is something .”The former Derry minor and Lavey senior winning captain is now an honarary club president. He is also an honarary member of Moyola Golf Club – titles not just handed out to anyone. They are earned through years of service.When the lock-down subsides, Colm will be back swinging the clubs again.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

It was announced yesterday that fishing will be allowed as part of the easing of the lockdown restrictions. Glenowen Fisheries, which is based within Creggan Country Park, will be among the local facilities to re-open next. A spokesperson for the fisheries stressed that people would need to pre-book and pre-pay before arriving at the facility. Fisheries Minister Edwin Poots has confirmed that the Public Angling Estatewill gradually re-open to local anglers from Monday. Thirty PAE’s across Northern Ireland will re-open to the public for recreational use, but anglers should only use the DAERA facilities within their local area and should not travel long distances. Minister Poots also confirmed that car parking facilities will remain closed until  May . googletag.cmd.push Speaking about the announcement, the Minister said:“In the interests of public health, I shut down the angling estate on  March, to discourage unnecessary journeys and protect my staff as well as anglers themselves, given that the majority are in the + age bracket and many have concessionary angling licences due to underlying health issues. “While car parks will remain closed until  May to discourage long journeys, I have decided to permit local anglers back on to the Public Angling Estate so that they can participate in their favourite recreational activity. “By its nature, angling is a solo sport or hobby, and its participants can enjoy a day’s fishing without being in close contact with others. The sport has huge benefits for people’s mental and physical well-being and in this time of uncertainty, I know that many people have missed the solitude and peace that angling and being outdoors with nature, brings them. googletag.cmd.push “However, let me be clear – anglers must continue to follow social distancing guidelines, practice good hand hygiene and walk to their nearest PAE, fishing alone or with a member of their own household. I do not want to see crowds of people near the river banks and fisheries.

Sister Clare Crockett was just -years-old when she died in the stairwell of her school in Equador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake on April , . Since her death many people from across the world have begun praying to her and her grave in the City Cemetery has become a place of pilgrimage. In recent weeks, her photograph has been displayed in the windowsof homes across Derry, as people pray for her intercession during the coronaviruspandemic, googletag.cmd.push A novena prayer to Sister Clare Crockett, which was written by her holy order, ServantSistersof the Home of the Mother, is also said to be bringing great comfort during these uncertain times. Heranniversary mass was held by Carmelite Priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, at Termonbacca last month and was broadcast on its YouTube channel to over , people. People who havent been to mass in years tuned in to YouTube and Facebook to watch her mass, said Sean Gallagher, who helps run a novenaprayer group in her memory. Mr Gallagher and PatsyMcCallion decided to take her banner around ious churches in the city, whose doors remain closed due to the coronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push We took it up to Termonbacca to see Fr Stephen and then we went to see Fr Joe Gormley in St Marys in Creggan and then it just went on and on, explained Mr Gallagher. This year more than any other Sr Clare has been catapulted into the limelight. More people are praying to her than ever before. Before the coronavirus there was a woman who came all the way from Poland to visit Sr Clares grave. She said you just dontrealise how special this woman is. So many people are looking for her photograph and Novena we just cant print them fast enough. In recent weeks Sister Clares sisters, Shauna Gill and Megan Nicell, have travelled around the city delivering hundreds of photographs and novenas to houses and local shops. Sister Clare was a self confessed party girl with a promising show business career in front of her when she joined the ServantSistersof the Home of the Motherat just . Since her death several miracles have been attributed to her and calls have been made for her to be made a saint.The miracles are working all the time, said Mr Gallagher. We should be shouting from the rooftops about her. This is our saint - she was a wee woman from the heart of the Bog. I hope she is made a saint sooner rather than later. It is something that can take hundreds of years but I hope to see it in my letime. I was talking to a young woman recently who had a picture of Sr Clare in her window. I asked her about it and she said she got it from the chip shop in Rosemount. She told me I dont pray but I chat away to that wee nun every day. That is a small miraclein itself. At this time more than ever people are putting their faith in her. She is moving young people because she was so young.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in.

However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone.

This legislation will help to maximise the possible investment in a key public asset.Ms Hargey added: ldquoWithout a reversal of the classication decision the number of new social homes built each year would be reduced signicantly.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

They also claimed the existing plant in Killyleagh is operating well below capacity and can easely accommodate with sewage from Crossgar.But local councillors Sam Osborne and Albert Colmer have been highly critical of the DoErsquos attitude towards people in the Crossgar and Killyleagh areas and say that in a supposed era of open Government and accountability, the Departmentrsquos attitude is nothing short of ldquodeplorable and diabolical.ARDGLASS ndash A former primary school could be developed as a new community facility in Ardglass, it has emerged this week.Education chiefs say they are prepared to hand over the former Ardglass Primary School at the Downpatrick Road to the local Development Association after years of neglect.The school, which closed its doors over  years ago, was to have been developed as a new library facility, and while education chiefs claim this plan is not dead yet, they are prepared to allow the former school to be redeveloped by the local group.In addition, East Down Institute officials are understood to be interested in providing outreach classes in Ardglass and local councillor Dermot Curran says he is ldquodelighted there is now movement on the future of the old building.He has unveiled plans to hold an urgent meeting between the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the Ardglass Development Association, Down Council and the East Down Institute, to discuss a way forward.CLOUGH ndash An elderly woman was the victim of a terrying ordeal last week when masked men tied her up at her Clough home for four hours.The two intruders broke into the pensionerrsquos home at around .am on Sunday morning, tying her feet and hands before demanding money and then ransacking her house.The lady eventually managed to free herself at around am and sought help from a neighbour who reported the incident to police.

Only four of the nine entries went to post with Newcastle ride Tom Newsam setting off in the lead on his own Miss Lennihan, followed by Colin McBratney on Belle Lady, owned and trained at Strangford by Joe Magee.Belle Lady came down and victory went to Midnight Auburn, owned and ridden by Downpatrickrsquos Gerry Lavery, whose son, Declan, is one of todayrsquos top local amateur riders. Miss Lennihan took second as Paddy Fitzsimons had to pull up on Heatherrsquos Braes.The winner was trained by Gerryrsquos brother, Brian, who works for Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee.

This horse took part in the fourth race, the Andi Grand Prix qualier and, with Rathfriland jockey Leo Gracey in the saddle, made all at the running to come home four s clear of Glen Keys, ridden by Paul Larkan, and Bentra Road, ridden by Tom Howley. Frankie Fitzsimons was fourth on Davy Blackrsquos Anns Penny.The winner, making his debut, ran in the colours of Rathfrilandrsquos Sam McKee, better known as Uel, who told me not all that long ago, that they arrived at the track that day in a makesht horse box and parked beside some of the lorries from top stables.The East DownshireOpen Farmers Race went to Grange Valleyrsquo, owned and trained by former good amateur Ballymenarsquos Samy Patton and ridden by Robert Steele, who rode all his runners.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area. The scheme has the potential to create new hotel and retail development, creating jobs and boosting the economy.ldquoThe project is people-driven and providing facilities for them.

Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it.

This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle.

We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside.

Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews. John will be sorely missed. May he rest in peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11358491.jpg","title":"couple eighties walking  lengths aisling centre","story":"PLEASE NOTEIt is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

Its important to us that we support it as much as possible.ldquoIts uplting being able to do that. It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid. Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That has meant the world.ldquoWithout public pressure, this whole disgusting saga would have been buried.We promised Harry we would get him justice.#HarryDunns have today called on the Foreign Secretary @DominicRaab to order a full public inquiry into the handling of events after Harrys death. Please see attached statement. https:t.co oYdAzxPrmdash Radd SeigerMay , ldquoThat is what we will do and no-one will get in our way.ldquoWe have given the Government every chance to come clean to us. They slapped us in the face each time, clearly trying to hide what they did.ldquoOur only wish now, apart from ensuring Mrs Sacoolas faces justice, is that this should never happen to another family again.ldquoFollowing our experience, this Government clearly cannot be trusted to look after us, the people.ldquoAs a nation, we have to get back to a more decent way of doing things.ldquoThis is not the sort of society we should be where our elected officials think itrsquos OK to kick those in most need of help.Calling for the inquiry on behalf of the parents, Mr Seiger told PA: ldquoGiven the horric nature of what has happened in this case, with all its dferent strands and the extent to which Government has sought to cover it up, there must be an inquiry the nation can have confidence in.ldquoAn inquiry can restore trust and faith in Government, so as to ensure that anyone involved in misconduct in public office are held to account and so that lessons are learned and systems are put in place so that no such abuse of human rights is committed by Government again.A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: ldquoWe have deep sympathy for Harryrsquos family.

However, over the past few weeks clarityhas been provided by Ministers through a set of guidelines which it is suggested, should be address prior to any formal decision to reopen being made.As such council officers have proposed an initialoperating model to see the borough’s four main sitesreopen.The report states that services at these premises would be availableto the general public on weekdays from am to pm.A Saturday morning slot would,these recommendation are approved by Council, be available only for health care and associated workers.It is also suggested that initiallywaste is limited to black bag and potentially green waste and that only cars are to be permitted.The need to limit the reopening to the four main recycling initially, is, the report claims, “based on a mix of waste product capacity and maximising the use of key staff ”.The report concludes by stating that the implementation of this model is dependant on Council’s abilityto redeploy staff and on the speed at which waste operators could get their service operational, ensuring that the vehicles are road worthy.Given these considerations the report suggests it may take up to five working days from a decision being made to the actual reopening of the four sites.This issue is due to be debated at tonight’s virtual council meeting.The meeting is set to get underway at .pm and members of the public can watch the debate by clicking hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The borough’s five other sitesare to reopen at an unspecied later date.Addressing this plan, the Director acknowledgedthat the Executive’s announcementhad changed the nature of the debate.“There was an announcement this afternoon [Thursday] from the Executive that said travelling to recycling centres is, from Monday, an appropriate reason for travel,” said Mr Parkinson.“With that in mind, what I would suggest to members is that we progress with the proposed model initially. However in the following days, we work to open the other five sites shortly afterwards.”Addressing the issue SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon asked that this matter be dealt with under scheme of delegation in order to ensure that recycling centres can be opened promptly.He also asked that Council’s bulky waste collection service be “restarted in tandem” with the reopening of recycling centres and queriedhow recycling centres could cater for those who are shielding.His comments were address by Council’s ChiefExecutive, Roger Wilson, who said party group leaders had made their “desire to get centres open as quickly as possible” clear.He also said it would be a “matter of practicality”the decision were to remain under delegationas this would “remove the element of having to go through a call in period”.Council’s Strategic Director, Mark Parkinson, said he would agree with Councillor O’Hanlon “on the point about bulky waste collection restarting at the same time” as recycling centres reopen.Ulster Unionist Party councillor, Julie Flaherty, commendedthe “fantastic job” waste men and women are doing across the borough and said her party would support steps to reopen these centres quickly and safely.The Alliance Party’s Cllr Eoin Tennyson asked about PPE for staff and was informed by Mr Parkinson that the council has a sufficient supply of PPE.The Director also informed Cllr Tennyson that Council is meeting with unions “every morning” to make sure “the equipment is reaching the right people” and the supply of this equipment is “reviewed on a regular basis”.Councillor Darryn Causby welcomed the fact Council can now “get these centres open” and asked what type of material would be accepted at that start.He was informed by Mr Parkinson that in line with the initialproposal the sites will accept “black bags and general waste until processors are back up and running” and that “over a period of time, we will expand the waste cycle”.Independent Councillor Paul Berry called for a “common sense approach” to allowing certain trailers access to recycling centres.“Some areas across this borough, do not have a brown bin for their garden waste and I think their needs to be a common sense approach towards letting some trailers with garden waste have access to these sites,” said Cllr Berry.Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell, agreed with this point. However, the Council’s Strategic Director explained that restricting sites to cars and black bags only is an attempt to deal with an expected initialpeak in demand.“We will get a vast number of people looking to bring black bags and access the centres,” said Mr Parkinson. “We are limiting it to cars initiallyto manage capacity. Once we are over that peak, and we expect that to be within a few days, we can look at allowing access to trailers and white vans.“In regards to smaller sites, the other thing to consider is their size,we get the demand we expect, we will be forced to close them again very very quickly as they will be at capacity.”DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said he was concernedthatsmaller sites were not opened quickly, residents in those areas could feel “short changed”.His party colleague Alderman Gareth Wilson, said this issue was one the general public are “engaged with” and are aware that it is a service that can be offeredwith “social distancing kept in place”.He also said Council needs to be very careful about getting the message across about what type of material can be accepted at these centres.This view was agreed with by DUP Alderman Paul Rankin who said thatany announcementwas to be made, Council would need to “give a timeframe or specydetails on when the other five sites are going to open”.SDLP Councillor Thomas Larkham enquired about the openingtimes for the four main centres and was told they would open from Monday – Friday am to pm, initially, in line with the report presented to members.It was also made clear, following a query from SDLP Councillor Eamon McNeil, that a special time slot for NHS and other care staff would be in operation on Saturday mornings from am to  noon.DUP Councillor Margaret Tinsley then asked that Saturday opening hours be extended to allow all those back at work to access to the sites.An announcementon the issue is expected from Council tonight , following a party group leaders’ meeting where the issues raised during the debate will be discussed.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "}]
