She is pictured shaking hands with Thailand\u0027s immigration chief Surachate Hakparn after leaving her room today          Saudi teenager Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun barricaded herself in a hotel room (pictured, today) at a Thai airport, using tables, chairs and mattresses in a bid to avoid deportation          Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun (left) finally left her hotel room after talks with the UN refugee agency. She is pictured with Thai Immigration Police Chief Surachet Hakparn (right) at Bangkok airport ahead of being taken to a \u0027secure location\u0027  In a sign of growing desperation during the night, Rahaf posted video of her barricading her hotel room door with furniture. If sent back, she said she will likely be imprisoned, and is \u0027sure 100 percent\u0027 her family will kill her, she said          In a tweet this afternoon, Rahaf, who fears retaliation from her family after she renounced Islam, said she was \u0027scared\u0027 after learning her father had arrived in Thailand - but that she was \u0027safe\u0027 with the UN and Thai authorities          In another tweet today, Rahaf revealed that her passport had been returned to her and included a picture of the travel document\u0027My family will kill me\u0027: Saudi woman, 24, fleeing to...A Saudi woman\u0027s plea for help exposes risks runaways faceShare this articleBut the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees later said it had been granted access to the Saudi national to assess her need for international protection \u0027and find an immediate solution for her situation\u0027. Rahaf fled her \u0027abusive\u0027 family while travelling in Kuwait, and had flown to Thailand in the hopes of reaching Australia to seek asylum. But she was stopped  in Bangkok\u0027s Suvarnabhumi airport by Kuwaiti and Saudi embassy officials, she said, and has since been held in an airport hotel awaiting deportation. She said a Saudi official in the Thai airport confiscated her passport after her father reported her for travelling without her male \u0027guardian\u0027. He claimed she was mentally ill but failed to provide any evidence. Saudi culture and guardianship policy requires women to have permission from a male relative to work, travel, marry, and even get some medical treatment. The deeply conservative Muslim country lifted a ban on women drivers last year.The incident comes as Saudi Arabia faces intense scrutiny over the shocking murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, which has renewed criticism of the kingdom\u0027s rights record.      Rahaf (centre, today) said \u0027I feel save now under UNHCR protection\u0027 after holding talks with the UN refugee agency           UNHCR representative Giuseppe De Vincentiis (centre) was pictured walking into the transit hotel at the airport ahead of talks with Rahaf           Thailand\u0027s Immigration Police chief Major General Surachate Hakparn (pictured today) said Rahaf will not be sent anywhere against her wishes          Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, has been at Bangkok airport since Saturday when she was denied entry by Thai immigration officials, who deny her accusations that she was detained at the behest of the Saudi government          Rahaf made desperate appeals for help and repeated calls to speak to someone from the UN          Rahaf has said on Twitter that she fears her family will kill her if she is forced to return to them from Thailand          On Twitter, Rahaf had written of being in \u0027real danger\u0027 if forced to return to her family in Saudi Arabia, and has claimed in media interviews that she could be killed. She said she had renounced Islam and is fearful of her father\u0027s retaliationAfter announcing that Thailand \u0027will not force her\u0027 to leave, Thailand\u0027s immigration chief Surachate Hakparn told reporters that Rahaf would be \u0027allowed to stay\u0027 after a meeting with officials from the UN refugee agency UNHCR.\u0027She is under the care of the UNHCR now but we also sent Thai security to help take care (of her),\u0027 Surachate told reporters at Suvarnabhumi airport.He said the teenager had told UNHCR officials she \u0027wants to stay in Thailand for a while while seeking asylum to a third country\u0027.The agency \u0027will take five days to consider her status\u0027 and another five days to arrange for travel, Surachate said, adding that he would meet with Saudi diplomats on Tuesday to explain Thailand\u0027s decision. UNHCR\u0027s spokesman in Geneva Babar Baloch confirmed Rahaf had \u0027left the airport to a safe place in the city\u0027 and said agency officials would interview her once she had had some rest.Surachate had told reporters earlier Monday Qunun was stopped by immigration because Saudi officials had contacted them to say she had fled her family.\u0027Thailand is a land of smiles. We will not send anyone to die,\u0027 he said. \u0027We will take care of her as best as we can.\u0027 Surachate also acknowledged for the first time Saudi embassy had alerted Thai authorities to Qunun\u0027s arrival.\u0027The Saudi Arabia embassy contacted the immigration police ... and said that the girl had run away from her parents and they fear for her safety,\u0027 he said.\u0027We acknowledged this and checked her paperwork. She had a passport but no return ticket, no travel plan, and no destination or hotel reservation in Thailand... so per airport security procedures, immigration denied her entry.\u0027          Rahaf Mohammed al Qunun, 18, sent this selfie to MailOnline from the Bangkok airport hotel room in which she is being held. She believes she will be murdered by her family if she is deported           Rahaf accused Kuwait Airlines and the Saudi embassy of working together to take her passport when she arrived in BangkokThe UNHCR said its representative had met her but would not comment on the details of the meeting or its outcome.It said in a statement that Thailand had a responsibility not to expel or return anyone to a territory where their life or freedom would be threatened.\u0027This principle is recognised as customary international law, and is also enshrined in Thailand\u0027s other treaty obligations,\u0027 the UNHCR statement said.Last night, speaking from an airport hotel room guarded by security officials, Rahaf told MailOnline: \u0027I am scared. My brother told me that he\u0027s waiting with some Saudi men. \u0027They will take me to Saudi Arabia and my father will kill me, because he is so angry. He will kill me. My family do this. I know them.\u0027They kept telling me they will kill me if I do something wrong - they say that since I was a child.\u0027She, her parents, and her six siblings live in Ha\u0027il in Saudi Arabia, where her father works as a government official. She says she has suffered beatings and emotional abuse from her family, at one point being locked in her room for six months for cutting her hair. When they took a trip to visit family in Kuwait she made her escape, buying flights from Kuwait to Thailand and from Thailand to Australia with help from a friend, and taking a taxi to the airport at 4am after checking her father was asleep.    Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, had earlier tweeted: \u0027I have been detained in an airport hotel. I will be forcibly repatriated tomorrow to Kuwait and then Saudi. There is an airport person who constantly follows me. I can\u0027t even ask for protection or asylum in Thailand.\u0027In a video, Rahaf is shown detained in an airport hotel in Bangkok with security officials preventing her from leaving the building      Rahaf shared this copy of her passport saying on Twitter, \u0027I\u0027m sharing it with you now because I want you to know I\u0027m real and exist\u0027      Rahaf\u0027s situation is reminiscent of the case of Dina Ali Lasloom, picturedShe said: \u0027My name is Dina Ali and I\u0027m a Saudi woman who fled Saudi Arabia to Australia to seek asylum.\u0027Please help me. I\u0027m recording this video to help me and know that I\u0027m real and I\u0027m here.\u0027If my family come, they will kill me.\u0027Ms Lasloom\u0027s passport was confiscated by authorities in the Philippines at Manilla airport, and she was held for 13 hours.Her case received publicity via help from a Canadian tourist, but she was nonetheless reportedly duct-taped before being being forced on a flight back to Riyadh by uncles.She has not been heard from since.                                                    Thailand\u0027s immigration chief Hakparn had earlier said Rahaf would be sent back to Saudi Arabia by Monday morning, adding, \u0027It\u0027s a family problem\u0027. But Rahaf and charity Human Rights Watch said in fact she was stopped by Saudi and Kuwaiti officials when she arrived in Suvarnabhumi airport and her passport was forcibly taken from her after a a male guardian had reported her for travelling \u0027without his permission\u0027.Rahaf said she was trying to flee her family, who subjected her to physical and psychological abuse. She took to Twitter to plead her case, creating a profile with an Arabic bio that reads \u0027I just want to survive\u0027.During a video livestream showing her walking around a carpeted hallway, Rahaf spoke in Arabic about how her father had told Saudi embassy officials she was a \u0027psychiatric patient\u0027 who had to be returned, even though she had \u0027an Australian visa\u0027.\u0027I can\u0027t escape the airport,\u0027 she said in the live video. \u0027I tried but there\u0027s a security (official) watching me.\u0027 Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson told MailOnline yesterday: \u0027Rahaf faces being sent back to face honor related violence from her family, and openly says that her father will kill her.\u0027On Sunday, Rahaf told the BBC that she had renounced Islam, and feared she would be forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia and killed by her family. Online, Arabic speakers, human rights activists and journalists have attempted to bring a media spotlight to the case on Twitter using the hashtag #SaveRahaf. Her story has all the hallmarks of the case of Dina Ali Lasloom, 24, a Saudi woman who hoped to find sanctuary in Australia from a forced marriage.In April 2017 she was detained in Manilla airport by authorities in the Phillipines,  taken back to Saudi Arabia by her uncles and never heard from again.       "},{"url":null,"title":"Jeremy Thorpes lover Norman Scott deeply moved dubbed true queer hero","story":"    Norman Scott today said he was \u0027deeply moved\u0027 by the dedication but said others involved in the conspiracy should face justice  Ben Whishaw played Norman Scott in A Very English Scandal last year (pictured left).

Those wishing to indulge in a bit of Al fresco dining can do so at this wooden table which comes complete with an umbrella on top. While outside, the lucky buyer can also take a stroll though the  tiered garden with a paved terrace area and also access the lawn area outside the property   At the top of the property sits a fairy-tale white and grey cupola (pictured left outside and right inside). The cupola provides natural light to enter the property and can also be used as lookout           A floor plan of the property shows the multitude of rooms spread across its three floors. The house underwent a big refurbishment just before the current owners bought it in 2005\u0027It might seem a bit extravagant for a stables, but it dated back to a time when often they valued their horses more than their wives. To spend money on a stables like that, you would have been very proud of it.\u0027Firbank was converted into its own house in the 1950s and underwent a big refurbishment just before the current owners bought it in 2005.\u0027They liked the quirkiness of it and that it offered something different but now they are moving further north to be closer to family.\u0027I think it will be bought by somebody who likes that romantic look. People tend to buy houses that remind them of their childhood or set a little spark burning.\u0027I think it\u0027s going to be a family looking for something which is a bit outside the box, something with a bit of a twist.\u0027I could see it appealing to a writer or someone who loves the outdoors as you\u0027ve got lots of woodland and lovely walks around you. The owners say the clear skies are amazing, especially in the summer, as you have no light pollution there.\u0027 The property can be viewed here: https:www.struttandparker.compropertiescharles-hill "},{"url":null,"title":"Daily lives Victorian street sellers revealed remarkable photographs","story":"    Kentish Herb Woman is pictured selling herbs on Greenwich High Road in South East London in the 1880s, in one of many remarkable photographs dating back to Victorian times which reveal the daily lives of adult and child street sellers  Old Clo\u0027 Man (left) sold second-hand top hats and clothes of smallpox victims at heavily discounted prices, but his was a risky trade thanks to it being a crime to not dispose of infected clothing of sufferers.

Mohamed Adul knocks into revellers with his 4x4 on a packed dancefloor injuring eight people in revenge for being thrown out by door staffAbdul, of  Deptford, south east London, was arrested at the scene after being restrained by clubbers and door staff.On trial at Maidstone Crown Court in Kent, he denies denies two counts of attempted murder and several counts of causing GBH with intent. Opening the case today in front of High Court Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb and the jury of 10 men and two women, prosecutor Simon Taylor said: \u0027This course of conduct involved him using his car as a weapon by deliberately driving at a large group of people who were trying to enjoy a night out in Blake\u0027s nightclub.\u0027The manner in which the defendant drove was not short in either duration or distance. It was a determined and indiscriminate effort to cause death to those people present.\u0027Mercifully, and no thanks to the defendant, death was not caused by his driving but serious injury was.\u0027  Abdul drove his 4x4 down the side alley next to Blake\u0027s nightclub in Gravesend, Kent, and ploughed into crowds in a marquee and dancefloor behind after being ejected for being drunkHaving explained the charges faced by Abdul, the prosecutor added there was \u0027an obvious intention to kill\u0027.\u0027Why else deliberately drive at speed into a group of defenceless people offering no threat at all. The Crown\u0027s case here is that in reality the defendant could have had no other intention whatsoever,\u0027 he explained.CCTV footage played in court was also said to \u0027speak volumes\u0027 as to what Abdul intended that night.Nine minutes long, it captured his ejection from the club, returning in the Vitara and then the dramatic moment the car ploughed past bollards and down the alleyway.Having reached the marquee, the vehicle stopped for nine seconds before careering into unsuspecting revellers on the busy chequered dancefloor.One doorman later described the car swerving \u0027all over the place\u0027 and deliberately trying to hit as many people as possible.          CCTV footage played in court was also said to \u0027speak volumes\u0027 as to what Abdul intended that nightMr Taylor said: \u0027Tyre marks were left by the vehicle as it careered into the marquee. It then reversed, the Crown say, to line up another strike at the occupants of the marquee but that was fortunately stopped by the intervention of clubbers and members of staff\u0027.Abdul had arrived at the club in Queen Street just before 8.40pm and was escorted out three hours later for his \u0027apparent intoxication\u0027, the jury heard.Customers had complained about his \u0027demeanour and conduct\u0027, said the prosecutor.\u0027In response to being asked to leave, the defendant said words to the effect of \u0027I\u0027m going to shut you down tonight\u0027. The CCTV footage clearly shows that he is angry while being ejected from the club,\u0027 he added.Abdul, described as being drunk, having glazed eyes and smelling of alcohol, was said to be pleading with doormen to be allowed back in.The CCTV footage showed him then walking the short distance to where he had parked his grey and black Vitara before returning and pulling up outside the club.          Abdul, of Deptford, south east London, was arrested at the club after being restrained by clubbers and door staff - but denies attempted murderAllegedly revving the engine and shouting \u0027I told you I\u0027d be back\u0027, a doorman realised what was happening and quickly reacted to pull open the driver\u0027s door.But Abdul then accelerated at speed down the alleyway and burst through the gates halfway down.Mr Taylor said the \u0027tight\u0027 manoeuvre from the road outside the club was \u0027careful and deliberate\u0027, demonstrating a \u0027considered piece of driving\u0027.Clubbers screamed and shouted \u0027He\u0027s trying to drive at us\u0027 and had to e for safety, the court heard.One bouncer struck the bonnet and windscreen while a young woman who fell to the ground had to be dragged to safety by door staff as the vehicle hurtled towards her.\u0027He made no attempt to stop and as he made his way along the alleyway, a number of customers and door staff had to jump out of the way or were pulled out of the way to avoid being hit,\u0027 continued Mr Taylor.\u0027As the defendant approached the entrance to the marquee he slowed down to a stop.\u0027Having stopped for around nine seconds, no doubt to make a final decision as to what he was going to do next, the defendant then executed that decision by driving into the marquee and across the dancefloor at considerable speed, hitting a number of people.\u0027In fact, the defendant travelled for a distance of around five to 10 metres and gave the customers and staff who were in the marquee no time to react.\u0027As a consequence, some of the occupants of the marquee were hit by the car and thrown onto the bonnet and then onto the floor.\u0027One woman dislocated her knee as people scrambled out of the way and tried to flee, screaming and shouting in panic. Others, including people in the alleyway, were left with bruising and cuts.Mr Joseph was hit by the 4x4 and pinned by both his legs to the side of the marquee, the court was told. Miss Wells heard the car revving towards her before being hit to her left-hand side.Her shoes came off and she found herself under the vehicle before being pulled out to safety, said Mr Taylor.Abdul then reversed the Vitara several metres before people surrounded it, smashed a window and dragged him from the driver\u0027s seat by his hair.The court heard he was \u0027abusive and uncooperative\u0027 to both officers and paramedics treating him for his own injuries, some caused by those who had restrained him. He later replied no comment when interviewed.The court was told the incident was not terror related.\u0027This case has been investigated and the Crown make it clear there is no terrorist element to the defendant\u0027s action,\u0027 added the prosecutor.\u0027The motivation was revenge and anger at being ejected from the club.\u0027 The trial continues.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/12/23/4F0D153200000578-0-image-m-13_1534112995695.jpg","title":"Exhausted mother 36 says living building site six months","story":"Rachel Cannon says that the building project outside her home (pictured, left, workers at the site) has left her exhausted (right, a crane on her doorstep\u0027I have had cement mixers outside, I have had to climb over my fence to get out of my house,\u0027 she said. \u0027It is so dangerous. \u0027I have been living on a building site for six months. They have called it unavoidable building work but it is horrendous, and it is still going on today.

But one’s personal library should do much more than anthologise warm feelingsThe latest TV series by charming, tidy-up guru Marie Kondo has landed on Netflix and while we are all in love with the vibrant folk featured in her show, last week I accidentally entered the damning territory of disagreeing with Kondo’s philosophy – in a tweet that went viral. For while I’d heed Kondo’s “Konmari method” for habits such as folding T-shirts, she is woefully misguided when she says we should get rid of books that don’t give us “joy”.In one video, Kondo helps a woman declutter her books by “waking them up”. Surely the way to wake up any book is to open it up and read it aloud, not tap it with fairy finger motions – but this is the woo-woo, nonsense territory we are in. Once the books are split into keep and get-gone piles, Marie and the woman thank the books for serving their purpose.The metric of objects only “sparking joy” is deeply problematic when applied to books. The definition of joy (for the many people yelling at me on Twitter, who appear to have Konmari’d their dictionaries) is: “A feeling of great pleasure and happiness, a thing that causes joy, success or satisfaction.” This is a ludicrous suggestion for books. Literature does not exist only to provoke feelings of happiness or to placate us with its pleasure art should also challenge and perturb us. We live in a frantic, goal-obsessed, myopic time. Everything undertaken has to have a purpose, outcome or a destination, or it’s invalid. But art doesn’t care a noodle about your Apple watch, your fitness goals, active lifestyle, right swipes, career and surrender on black pudding. Art will be around far longer than Kondo’s books remain in print. Art exists on its own terms and untidy timeline. As for culling one’s unread books – while that may be essential for reducing fire and tripping hazards, it is certainly not a satisfying engagement with the possibilities of literature. (Unless it’s self-help or golf, in which case, toss it.) Success is, eventually, actually reading your unread books, or at least holding on to them long enough that they have the chance to satisfy, dissatisfy or dement you. Unread books are imagined reading futures, not an indication of failure. In one episode of her Netflix series, Kondo helps two male writers declutter their very tidy home. When it comes to the books, the advice is grim. “Books are a reflection of our thoughts and values,” Kondo says to the viewer. “Will these books be beneficial to your life moving forward?”Books are not a reflection of our thoughts and values, because more often than not they reflect someone else’s, whether it is Lolita, Mrs Dalloway or Snoopy. Most of us don’t share the values of Adolf Hitler, but we may own many books about the second world war. The question of whether my books will be beneficial to my life moving forward requires a biblio-telepathy I do not possess. Our book collections record the narrative of expansion, ersion, regression, terror and yet-to-be-discovered possibilities of our reading life. This is why, on entering your living space, people immediately migrate to examine your bookshelves, rather than rummage in your cutlery or sock drawers.I read in a variety of ways – ebooks, audiobooks – and never mind donating or sharing books. But I can’t imagine what a blank collection of physical books I’d be left with if they had to spark joy. (Goodbye Jelinek, Bernhard and Kafka, hello books with photos of hippo feet.) When I look at my shelves, I marvel at how random books have ended up beside each other. Some are on my shelf on the strength of just one line or a paragraph. Some are gifts, others I found discarded in the street. But every purchase of a book is a gesture of faith in the writer who wrote it. Writers are nothing without readers. Rather than following Kondo’s rules, I’d like to suggest another: it should be obligatory that all living spaces come with built-in bookshelves. (And a hammock.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/373008075cfecbc184b6c736d1d37342463c0a2f/0_90_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1890c5b3954d1290b53a6d40ade704d","title":"what are your favourite independent bookshops and why","story":"As independent bookshop numbers rise for the second year in a row after 20 years of decline, we want to hear about your favourites After weathering two decades of decline, that also saw the rise of Amazon and fall of international chains like Borders, independent bookshops appear to be in good health, bucking current high street trends.

But it has attracted criticism for promoting laissez-faire, business-friendly policies that aim to boost private sector employment. Phillip InmanKim said: “It has been a great honour to serve as president of this remarkable institution, full of passionate iniduals dedicated to the mission of ending extreme poverty in our lifetime.“The World Bank Group is more important now than ever as the aspirations of the poor rise all over the world and problems like climate change, pandemics, famine and refugees continue to grow in both their scale and complexity.”However, in a letter to staff that is likely to be seen as veiled criticism of the organisation, the 59-year-old said: “The opportunity to join the private sector was unexpected, but I’ve concluded that this is the path through which I will be able to make the largest impact on major global issues like climate change and the infrastructure deficit in emerging markets.”Only last month Kim said the organisation would make about $200bn (£157bn) available to fund action on climate change from 2021-25, helping countries adapt to the effects of warming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.US presidents have traditionally appointed the head of the World Bank, while European governments normally decide the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Barack Obama chose Kim in 2012 to fill the shoes of Robert Zoellick, a former US government official.Kim’s abrupt resignation leaves Donald Trump with the opportunity to appoint a successor. He could turn to Bulgarian national Kristalina Georgieva, the bank’s chief executive, who will take over as interim president when Kim leaves. The much-respected official was a European commissioner and EU finance chief before moving to Washington.Before Kim took over, the bank laid down criteria for appointing future presidents, which were designed to exclude officials with little experience of running large organisations or who lacked relevant experience, especially in the developing world.However, Trump is expected to use his effective power of veto to make sure a close adviser or a sympathetic political figure takes over.A senior official at an international charity, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was concerned that the World Bank’s aid efforts could be badly affected if the appointment became a political football.“It is a US appointment that is not necessarily meritocratic. It is something that the Trump administration controls and that has to be a source of concern,” he added.Kim said his achievements included persuading countries on the governing council, including the US, to boost the bank’s capital budget last year by a record $13bn. He said poverty around the world had fallen and the bank was on target to reach its goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.However, last year the bank was forced to admit that progress has slowed and efforts would need to be intensified to reach the goal. Poverty in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa also increased as aid efforts failed to cope with a dramatic increase in population across the region.Meanwhile, critics of the institution have pointed out that much of the reduction in global poverty levels over recent decades is largely down to domestic policies in communist China.Critics have also accused the bank of following a business-friendly agenda that allowed western companies to make profits from developing countries without paying a fair share in tax in those states."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d795cca06590a877ad7c018a251e9e814c5212a/0_0_5777_3794/master/5777.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cb2335dadaa58a69df2cd73c9fb0dca 1010w","title":"no deal brexit uk parliament","story":"Just because most people don’t want something to happen doesn’t mean it won’t. So it is with a no-deal Brexit. I believe the majority of MPs, ministers and most people across the UK are opposed to the self-inflicted damage to our economy and security that would result from crashing out of the EU. But there are just 81 days left, and there is a growing danger that a combination of brinkmanship, political paralysis, siren voices and drift will push us over the cliff edge.This is too serious for parliament to stand by. That is why I have tabled an amendment to the finance bill with a group of other cross-party committee chairs to put safeguards in place against no deal.The amendment would mean that if the government wanted to use some of the specific powers in the finance bill to implement no deal, it would have to give parliament a vote first or apply to extend article 50. The amendment doesn’t affect the normal operations of the Treasury and government. But it does make it harder for the government to drift into no deal without parliament being able to direct it.The damage from no deal would be deep and long-lasting. The police will immediately lose access to the European criminal databases, currently checked 500 million times a year in order to stop wanted criminals and terror suspects. Things like this and the European arrest warrant help save lives and deliver justice, and the police say without them our country is less safe.The sudden switch to WTO tariffs would hit our economy too. One company in my constituency told me that the price of one of its crucial ingredients would double overnight. Border delays would damage the tight supply chains on which manufacturing industry, jobs and apprenticeships all depend.No deal would weaken us internationally as well – including in the negotiation of future trade deals. It would shatter the UK’s reputation for diplomacy, sound governance and reason.Boris Johnson may make flippant remarks about prawn cocktail crisps. John Redwood may promise that our farmers will grow more British produce (presumably overcoming the life-cycle of plants by getting more seeds into the ground in time for April). But they are playing games with other people’s lives and livelihoods.I have heard some argue that they need the imminent threat of no deal to persuade people to back the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement, if not next week then later on. But the reality is that there is no majority for the deal either in parliament or the country – and this is an irresponsible way to try to resolve something with such lasting consequences.The country can’t afford to play Brexit chicken and wait to see who blinks first. We need to ensure that parliament has the powers to prevent no deal if it reaches that point.My amendment has support from MPs who will back the prime minister’s deal and MPs who oppose it, MPs who voted to leave and MPs who want a second referendum. It doesn’t avoid the difficult debates and disagreements ahead over the best way forward, but it at least gives us the chance to rule out the worst outcome. For the sake of families, businesses and our country, we have to make sure that we can prevent the chaos and damage of a no-deal Brexit.• Yvette Cooper is a Labour MP and chair of the home affairs select committee"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626f9f64766c136f8ee017934ba73910d2d5a6a1/0_95_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f009a52a7b7d20171addf9c00b621b94","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of healthy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘healthy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘healthy’.Share your photos of what healthy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 9 January at 10am.

Now his company Furniture Box is turning over more than £1m and looking to expandMonty George says he was always something of an entrepreneur. “When I was 12 I’d save up my pocket money to buy small things from Poundland like sushi-makers and laptop lights and then I’d list them online and make a small profit,” he says.“From there I tried selling everything from watches to electronics. When I was 15 I bought a load of mini dirt bikes from China to sell, but I realised that if anything went wrong with them I wouldn’t know how to fix them. I’d heard that furniture was one of the biggest growing markets online, so I ordered a couple of shipping containers of coffee tables and dining tables and it all went from there.”But being a budding eBay entrepreneur set him apart from his classmates. “I’d use my lunch breaks to answer messages from customers. I remember one Christmas selling touchscreen tablets that had a really high fault rate and I came back from school to over 100 messages to reply to, which was pretty soul destroying,” he says. “And then of course it was hard seeing friends all go off to university, but I remember the night before I got my A-level results my total eBay sales ticked over £1m. It was quite poetic really.”Three years later and his company Furniture Box has outgrown his parents’ shed and moved into a warehouse and office space in Wiltshire, with a team of six and growing. In 2016 the company turned over £1.06m. “The best thing for me is the customer feedback,” says George. “I get a real buzz when someone gives a product a good review or is happy with something that I’ve put a lot of time and effort into choosing.”Of course, things don’t always go right. “I remember an elderly gentleman recently purchased a chair from us and he left negative feedback, saying it was difficult to put together because he had Parkinson’s disease,” says George. “So I decided to travel to Surrey where he lives and help him put it up.”George says that building a successful business at such a young age has come with sacrifices. “When my friends were out partying at uni, I was putting the graft into the business, often working from 7am until 9pm, seven days a week,” he says.“I did have moments where I thought: ‘Have I made the right call here?’ I remember over one Christmas and new year period, while all my mates were having fun or relaxing, me and my business partner Dan were in our freezing cold warehouse putting up industrial storage racking. But I just knew that the business wasn’t going to grow without us putting in the time and effort.”Now his friends are graduating university, George says the tables have turned. “They’re struggling to start at the bottom, and have a lot of debt,” he says. “In a way I feel ahead of the curve because I’ve spent the last few years knuckling down. I actually think that being young is a great time to start a business. I had no overheads when I was living at my parents’ house and no real outgoings. It would’ve been much harder to do this if I’d had a mortgage and a family to feed. I also think that when you’re young you’re more willing to take risks, and obviously growing up online I had a really good understanding of how the technology worked.“I’ve picked up a lot of advice from family and friends over the years,” he adds. “One thing that particularly sticks out is not to over expand and get carried away, which is easy to do when stock is selling well.” But, he says, he’s still made “every mistake under the sun”.“In 2014 I got a huge tax bill because I hadn’t realised I had to pay VAT, so I had to sell some of my belongings to raise the money.”His advice to other young people who want to start a business is to get to know the market, and not feel daunted by what’s already out there. “Find your niche and offer something unique,” says George. “And if it’s going well, don’t stay still because other people will catch up with you. See what you can do better.”George says he’d like to see Furniture Box become as big as Ikea or Furniture Village. “We’d like to not just be doing furniture, but to expand into other areas of homeware and maybe start selling packs of furniture for new-builds,” he says. “There’s a lot of untapped potential out there that I can’t wait to get my teeth into.”Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Parents and school staff simply cannot trust what the government says on education funding.”Responding to the NEU analysis, a Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said that since 2017 the government had given every local authority more money for every pupil in every school in order to ensure fairer funding across the country.“Government provides this money to local authorities and they have the freedom to work with schools to allocate their budgets in a way that best suits local needs,” the spokesperson said.“While there is more money going into our schools than ever before, we do recognise the budgeting challenges schools face and that we are asking them to do more. That’s why we’re supporting schools and headteachers, and their local authorities, to make the most of every pound.”While schools have been struggling to meet rising costs, many local authorities have been forced to ert money from the main schools funding block they receive from the government to their high needs budget in order to meet growing demand for special educational needs support – a move that has to be sanctioned by the DfE.The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said Labour would end funding cuts and increase per-pupil funding. “The Tories have cut billions of pounds from our schools, which have seen their budgets falling for the first time in a generation,” she said.“With rising pressure on class sizes and teachers leaving in droves, a generation of children is paying the price for Tory failure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67495d5d0cdb4794c9f80f00fee6c312a02e6498/0_27_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0e8139133279e20ac0be2ed63a03b50","title":"brexit end boom in farmland prices forecasts say","story":"Decades-long boom in agricultural land prices will cease as EU subsidies are axedBrexit will slice nearly one-fifth off the value of Britain’s commercial farms according to forecasters, bringing to an end the decades-long boom in agricultural land prices as EU subsidies are withdrawn.Property experts Savills said farmland was likely to be the worst-hit sector in the entire UK residential and commercial property sector – faring even worse than shuttered high street shops – as common agricultural policy subsidies are withdrawn.Farmers committed to protecting habitats, improving flood management and enhancing air and water quality will be rewarded. However, the final shape of the subsidies is not yet known, leading to uncertainty as to who is going to lose out.Emily Norton, head of rural research at Savills, said: “Where we feel values might be knocked is where it’s bare commercial land, which has low natural capital potential. Where we’ve got no opportunity to earn additional public money you’ll be highly exposed to just returns from farming and therefore it’s going to require very high levels of management skill. They will be in demand but prices will be knocked.”Farmland was a better investment than even prime central London residential property in the decade running up to the Brexit vote in 2016, but has been falling since. According to Knight Frank an average UK hectare of farmland sold for just £398 in 1966 but rocketed to a peak of £20,500 in 2015, just before the EU referendum.In the residential property market, the next five years will be all about the north and the Midlands, as a Brexit-hit London market trails behind Manchester and Birmingham in terms of house price rises, according to forecasts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2bc69b52607575ad0e431832255c60c18ff3c7b/0_352_5375_3224/master/5375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55cad49c2abf902d8925d54afea31ade","title":"female penguins get stranded more because they travel further","story":"Longer journeys may exhaust birds, say scientists tracking them off South American coastMagellanic penguins finish breeding in Patagonia in February, and during the subsequent winter months head north, reaching as far as Brazil, in search of anchovies. But every year thousands become stranded, with many airlifted to safety onboard military aircraft.Writing in the journal Current Biology, researchers in Japan and Argentina report how they attached tracking devices to eight male and six female penguins in 2017 and tracked where the birds went after they left the breeding grounds of Cabo dos Bahía in Argentina and began the migration north in April.Previously it was unknown whether males and females took different paths or not.“Although some assumptions are made, the exact reason for the female-biased stranding has been unknown due to the lack of information on their behaviour outside the breeding season, despite the growing focus on the conservation of this species,” said Takashi Yamamoto, a co-author of the report from the Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Japan.The results from the study offer a clearer picture. While the authors note that only a small number of penguins were tracked, the females generally travelled further north, with many reaching waters off the coast of Uruguay. The males, meanwhile, predominantly stuck to waters off the Argentinian coast. The study also found males typically ed deeper than females: about 59 metres compared with about 35 metres.The authors offer a number of reasons why males and females may head to different areas – including to avoid competition for food – and why they e to different depths – the females’ smaller bodies may restrict the depths they can reach.They also suggest the different sexes may seek waters of different temperatures, with the lighter females preferring warmer, shallower surroundings. The females may be more susceptible to being swept along on sea currents, they add.While researchers are still trying to understand why penguins end up stranded, Yamamoto and colleagues suggest those that end up further north may have used more energy swimming or catching dispersed prey, leaving them exhausted. Climate change, pollution in the area or injury from fishing equipment could also play a role. Reports of strandings have noted that many penguins are unwell or exhausted, with some also washing up dead.“In addition, plastic remains have been reported in the stomach of beach-washed Magellanic penguins,” said Yamamoto, adding that a skewed sex ratio could potentially lead to a population decline.While the findings may not help prevent strandings, Yamamoto said it could help with conservation of the species in the face of growing human-generated hazards. “If we do not consider any conservation action, such as marine zoning, I expect that the number of stranding iniduals will increase.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50efb56b10da02160f9db4fecc3a7e753ab71524/0_53_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=723ffdadfa3001718ad57cc640cf67bc","title":"colour comeback sunshine yellow and fashion chemistry on the golden globes red carpet","story":"After the 2018 blackout, red-carpet stars revived vintage Hollywood style – though protest flared with many wearing ‘Time’s Up x2’ bracelets Lady Gaga is not the first actor to wear Valentino on the red carpet, but she is probably the first to dye her hair blue to match her gown.The award-season buzz that began around A Star Is Born last autumn pleased fans of fashion almost as much as it did movie fans, because of the intriguing prospect of seeing the world’s most fearless dresser on the biggest red carpets of them all. And Gaga’s first big moment as a nominated actor did not disappoint – at least on the fashion front. By the standards of Gaga, who wore a dress made of raw steak to the MTV awards and red latex to meet the Queen, the periwinkle-blue Valentino ballgown she chose for the Globes was a relatively tame choice. Nonetheless, with a train longer than its height, the grandest of puff sleeves and a coordinated pastel up-do, it was a dress to steal any show.The neckline and colour were strikingly similar to a dress worn by Judy Garland in the 1954 original of A Star Is Born. The messaging of Gaga’s look – a homage to Hollywood history, complete with 100 carats of Tiffany diamonds – suggested that Gaga is serious about reinventing herself as a Hollywood star.After last year’s Time’s Up-inspired red-carpet blackout, colour returned to the red carpet. There was a comeback for sunshine-yellow dresses, which were a phenomenon two years ago following the success of La La Land. Claire Foy, nominated for her role in First Man, wore a Miu Miu dress with starburst embroidery in a shade close to the custard Prada gown worn by The Marvellous Mrs Maisel’s Rachel Brosnahan.Political statements were largely limited to Time’s Up x2 bracelets, as worn by nominee Amy Adams and British actor Jameela Jamil, who revealed on Twitter that she was wearing jeans under her pink Monique Lhuillier ballgown to keep warm.Killing Eve continued to win style plaudits as Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh revived the fashion chemistry that played a part in the TV series’ success. Comer wore a black Ralph \u0026amp Russo evening gown with layers of sheer tulle that recalled her character’s infamous pink Molly Goddard dress, and perfectly offset the structured, asymmetric Versace white dress worn by co-star Oh.Oh, the first actor of Asian heritage to present the awards, followed her white gown with a red, tuxedo-collared dress, also by Versace, then changed into white-and-gold Stella McCartney.“I called the women’s gang. I called Stella McCartney. I called Donatella Versace,” Elizabeth Saltzman, Oh’s stylist, told People. “She’s wearing all-female designers, but that’s not a statement from her, or from me. It was a way for me to think about her, and how I respect her.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58e2d1a89460623d93f2795bc1cd3d2324b1a96f/0_59_2784_1670/master/2784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e3d9f1a9cb2b2029fd778f64177440d","title":"life rafts and bin bags at london fashion week mens shows a cold wall craig green","story":"Big statements and bold looks from the award-winning designers at London fashion week men’sA-Cold-Wall*, the label by 27-year-old designer Samuel Ross, has become one to watch. Ross used the spotlight on him at London fashion week men’s to show a collection which took its starting point, in part, from the migration crisis and the movement of people across bodies of water in Europe.This was more of a statement than a straightforward presentation of clothes to wear next season. There was an oppressive atmosphere throughout. The show took place in a blacked-out warehouse with bass-heavy music. Performers clung to a life raft in water close to the editors in the front row models walked slowly, stopping to look over their shoulders. At one point, a dog appeared and barked ferociously. A bite of sweetness came at the end – when Ross appeared on the runway, carrying his one-year-old daughter, Genesis.While the garments that A-Cold-Wall* produces are ostensibly wearable and simple – hoodies, macs, backpacks, trainers – the ideas behind them are far from it. Backstage, Ross explained that “the pool closest to the audience represents the pool of fear and preservation in the age of nationalism, the pool further away is the human pull to progression … I was alluding to movement of people but also the depths of fear of a bottomless pit, and the bravery and the triumph that is required to move through to the future.”Ross began A-Cold-Wall* in 2015 and has explored themes of race, class and various architectural movements. One of the few non-white designers in the industry, his grandparents came to England on the Empire Windrush. Ross is a protege of Louis Vuitton designer Virgil Abloh, and he also worked at Kanye West’s label, Yeezy.Recognition for him is growing – he won the emerging menswear talent award at the British fashion awards in December. He has the ambition of another British gamechanger –naming Alexander McQueen as an inspiration for his dramatic staging. “That’s a huge part of this for me,” he said “bringing in the age of McQueen again with expressive runway design.”Earlier in the day was the turn of Craig Green, a designer so influential that he has won menswear designer of the year at the British fashion awards three times.This season, his futuristic take on workwear turned to plastic. The material might be the subject of environmental campaigns but Green brought it to the catwalk in an appealing way. Six models wore bright pink, yellow, green and blue trousers and T-shirts made from bin bag plastic. This was the a household essential as never been seen before – smocked with elastic to form outfits any enterprising club kid would be proud of.As well as that smocking, Green used medieval textile techniques on harness-style tops and tassels that covered models’ faces. The plaid of a lumberjack shirt was reworked into long kaftan-like garments with slits across the middle of the body. Soft tailoring and outerwear were more wearable. A grey mac with a fuchsia back print, based on a painting owned by Green’s mother, was much admired.Backstage, Green – surrounded by well-wishers – said the collection was “about a man made of glass, and that idea of fragility and how emotion doesn’t mean weakness, it can also mean strength”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99aa4c4d2f1d15141aa15f771a6d3f92286eee6d/0_178_5327_3197/master/5327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=172d1ab1f04cb731e991305218472425","title":"golden globes 2019 red carpet pictures","story":"Lady Gaga, Octavia Spencer, Sandra Oh and more arrive for the 76th edition of the film and television awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a6381e819cf66712afb3c7fee8aa9348cfdff56/0_52_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c8c4f6e9edf0f51e7acd8e84cfa0911","title":"backstage at craig greens autumnwinter show in pictures","story":"The designer’s futuristic take on workwear went plastic this season, featuring models wearing trousers and T-shirts made from bin bag material "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b69ecb372ff826e74c7ffddea9e1df71762dcee4/0_3000_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62daf42190229e2dbc5a8a1de5f5bbd3","title":"thomasina miers lancashire cheese and ham pie recipe","story":"What could be more comforting than a pie? Especially one filled with silky-soft onions, creamy celeriac and succulent hamI always forget about pies. How foolish I am! When you have the time and inclination, you can spend a few blissful, therapeutic hours forgetting the world’s turbulent times and making your own buttery, flaky pastry to e into. Otherwise, cheat on the pastry and spend less than an hour assembling and baking a comforting, calming, nourishing creation that will make you beam inside and out.The buttery, silky-soft onion, cheese and celeriac filling is soothing and delicious – with or without the ham.40g butter1 bay leaf1 onion, finely sliced¼ nutmeg, gratedSalt and black pepper 350g celeriac, peeled100g cooked ham, shredded180g lancashire cheese, grated350g puff pastry1 egg, beaten with a splash of milkHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)375Fgas 5. Melt the butter in a small pan and add the bay, onion and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper, cook for eight to 10 minutes, until the onion is soft but not coloured, then take off the heat and leave to cool.Meanwhile, cut the celeriac into quarters and use a mandoline to slice them as thinly as you can – or just use a sharp knife. Bring a pan of salted water to a boil and cook the celeriac for a few minutes, until tender, then drain.On a floured surface, roll out the pastry to about 2mm thick. Use a bowl 10-12cm in diameter to cut out eight rounds of pastry, using the rolling pin to stretch four of them so they’re about 1cm larger in diameter than the others.Put the smaller rounds on an oven tray lined with baking paper, and prick all over with a fork. Arrange half the celeriac on the bottom of the rounds, leaving a 1cm gap around the edge, and season, then layer up with half the onion, cheese and ham. Repeat with all four layers for all the rounds, then brush the edges with egg wash and put the larger pastry round on top. Use a fork or your fingers to crimp the edges together, then brush all over with more egg wash.Bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes, until the pastry is golden. Serve with mustard and a green salad.Crisp, raw celeriac in a remoulade is a revelation in winter when you want a change from rich, heartier food. A mustard-heavy dressing is essential, then pair with masses of chopped parsley and smoked fish, a softly poached egg or the more traditional ham. Leftover lancashire cheese is great in a toastie, especially with anything pickled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f1c9b89985b07899a28243e6c3dff4c7c944152/0_178_3096_1857/master/3096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a208a592c262ef3715146ad3de85a160","title":"fa cup fourth round arsenal manchester united ","story":"Arsenal will face Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth round while Newport have been rewarded for their exploits against Leicester City with a trip to Middlesbrough.

The Tottenham manager had brought up Arsène Wenger and how his former adversary at Arsenal had endured “a lot of limitations” with regard to the Emirates Stadium project but, at the same time, was still expected to win trophies.To Pochettino the parallels to his present situation are plain and that is not to say they have surprised him or made him unhappy. He knew what he was signing up for in 2014 when he accepted the job offer from the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, and the overall boss, Joe Lewis.It was to manage the team on a relative shoestring, driving it as hard as he could, as the club streamed their revenues into the new stadium project. In other words, precisely what Wenger did for much of the second half of his 22-year Arsenal tenure.Pochettino’s problem – if that is the right word – has been that he has performed ahead of the curve. He says that Levy’s demand was for the club to enter the new stadium with the chance to compete for a top-four Premier League finish and then to deliver one in the season after that.Instead Pochettino has returned top-three finishes in each of the last three seasons and the expectation now is that he wins trophies. It is the obvious next step, albeit the most difficult one, and it colours the club’s Carabao Cup semi-final against Chelsea – the first leg of which is at Wembley on Tuesday night.Pochettino’s thoughts turned to Wenger’s longevity and loyalty at Arsenal and he said he had one question for him: was it worth it? It is a question that appears to resonate with Pochettino as he approaches a crossroads in his career. Does he remain true to the project at Spurs or would he be tempted by an offer from Manchester United or Real Madrid in the summer?“I hope, if I have the opportunity to talk with Arsène Wenger, to ask if it was worth it?” Pochettino said. “I don’t know what he would say.”He has an inkling. “I have massive, huge respect for Arsène Wenger because when you talk about 22 years in charge of a club like Arsenal, you need to be so good – not only a fantastic coach but a great human being, to display the values you have,” the Tottenham coach said. “That is why it is a little bit sad the way it ended at his club. It shows how difficult this business is. But for us it is not a business, it is a passion. All that Arsène Wenger gave for Arsenal, to finish in the way it finished, yes, was a little bit unfair.Pochettino made the point explicitly that he is happy at Spurs at the moment. He will not deviate from this line. But he also acknowledges it is impossible to foresee the future.Pochettino is not the type of manager to bang down the chairman’s door demanding new signings and at Spurs he has relished the challenge of finding other ways to compete, such as developing players from the academy. Equally he is not blind to the benefits of big spending."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe9c78c215d48c8fd2b3ff60c0def467218a6b9f/29_150_4435_2661/master/4435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b83ba85f3a4b33ce7f99d02459a043f","title":"wolves liverpool fa cup third round match report","story":"It would be wrong to suggest a club with Liverpool’s proud history will be completely unmoved by a third-round elimination from a competition they have won seven times. They do, however, clearly have other priorities and it was certainly difficult to remember the last time a team from Anfield has seemed as indifferent, blasé even, about the FA Cup as Jürgen Klopp’s team did during this defeat.The best time to judge whether Klopp was right to take such a risk will come at the end of the season, when we know whether the current Premier League leaders have held their position at the top of the table. For now, however, all that really can be said is they were obliging opponents for a Wolves side that fully took advantage of Klopp’s team selection and won a rather dishevelled tie with a firecracker of a shot from Rúben Neves.In truth Wolves made it into the fourth round despite their own performance that seldom rated above six out of ten. Equally, it was never likely they would have to reach their peak levels on a night when Liverpool’s approach could be accurately gauged by the fact Klopp started with two teenage debutants, Curtis Jones and Rafael Camacho, and a 16-year-old, Ki-Jana Hoever, was brought on after six minutes because of a hamstring injury to Dejan Lovren. Hoever, recruited from the Ajax academy, became only the third man – or, rather, boy – of that age to appear for Liverpool in the club’s entire history and their youngest ever player in the FA Cup.Klopp would still be entitled to point out his starting XI included nine full internationals and, in a prickly press conference afterwards, he insisted he had taken the game seriously. “We’re not here to make a record for the world’s youngest team,” he said. “The boys train with us and the reason they train with us is because they are good enough. We train ten v ten and, believe me, they do much better than they did tonight.”He went on to say the principal reason why Liverpool struggled to make better use of the ball was the swirling wind and mentioned it again when summarising the winning goal. Was he disappointed with the senior players? “They can do much better,” he concluded.All the same there could be little doubt about his priorities, with Alisson, Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson among those given the night off. Liverpool managed only nine touches inside the opposition penalty area. Divock Origi’s goal to make it 1-1, after Raul Jiménez had opened the scoring for Wolves, was one of only two shots on target from the away side and, to put it another way, Lovren’s early departure meant Klopp experimenting with a back four comprising one player who is not old enough to start driving lessons, an 18-year-old at right-back, a reserve left-back in the shape of Alberto Moreno and Fabinho, who would usually be found in midfield, operating as a centre-half. For Wolves it was a golden opportunity to reach the fourth round and, if anything, they could conceivably have made it an easier night.As it was, it took a while before Nuno Espírito Santo’s players took heed of the “Cup Inspiration” headline on the back of the Wolverhampton Express \u0026amp Star, urging them to win for the recently deceased Bill Slater, who captained the side to their last FA Cup triumph in 1960.The tempo was far too slow early on, from both sides, and it was surprising perhaps that it was not until Jiménez’s 38th-minute goal that the home side exerted any real control. James Milner lost possession just inside the opposition half. Diogo Jota slipped the ball to Jiménez and he simply kept running, avoiding Fabinho, cutting in diagonally from the right and beating Simon Mignolet with a diagonal finish just inside the post.Liverpool had to improve in the second half and, six minutes after the restart, they were level. Milner had the first attempt and, when the ball rebounded to Origi, he adjusted his feet before sending a left-footed shot past John Ruddy in the home goal.It was a splendid strike but the game’s outstanding moment came four minutes later when Neves collected the ball almost 30 yards out. As soon as his first touch created the shooting angle, there was no doubt he was going to let fly. His shot was powerfully struck but it was the precision, just inside the near post, and the way the ball moved in midair, with so much late dip, that deceived Mignolet. “Such a beautiful goal,” Santo said afterwards. “It’s something he does and we encourage him to do.”Klopp responded by bringing on Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino in the 70th minute and, finally, Liverpool started to play with a bit more urgency. The closest they came to another equaliser was Xherdan Shaqiri curling a free-kick against the woodwork, via Ruddy’s fingertips, and Hoever in particular showed glimpses of his talent for the future. Yet Klopp must have been disappointed that his understudies, Daniel Sturridge in particular, could not make a more favourable impact and the reward for Wolves is a fourth-round tie at either Shrewsbury Town or Stoke City."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4c460d01b6edc9d9eba62f31dd361a4c6567b4e/0_186_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7bf3c3a02ce9155f8075a26a2bc3ca0","title":"fa cup fourth round draw live","story":"Arsenal were paired with Manchester United, while non-league Barnet will host Brentford in the last 32 of the competitionThe full draw for the fourth round of the FA CupThat’s your lot.

Mignolet is coming forward... 90 min There will be three minutes of added time.89 min It’s been fairly close but Wolves would be deserved winners. They picked a stronger team and they’ve been the stronger team.88 min At the other end, Cavaleiro overhits a through pass to Vinagre. That was a trickier pass than Keita’s at the other end, so curb your opprobrium.86 min “Most of Liverpool’s earthier pubs will be full of Evertonians,” says Mark Leadbeater, “so proffer away.” 85 min That Salah half-chance came from a thrilling piece of play from Hoever, who won the ball in his own area and marched 40 yards before finding Shaqiri.84 min The first bit of life from Salah, who zips infield from the right and hits a deflected shot which is headed away by Bennett. That might have been going in. Moments later, Keita has a chance to play Salah through but grossly overhits a relatively simple pass.83 min A Wolves change: Helder Costa replaces the excellent Raul Jimenez, who scored a good goal and worked his organs off.82 min Origi wins a corner for Liverpool. It amounts to nowt, and then Camacho again shoots wide from long range. That was a better effort, which whistled a few yards wide of the far post.80 min It’s not necessarily an opinion I’d proffer just after last orders in some of Liverpool’s earthier public houses, but I think this would probably be a good result for both sides.79 min It’s all Liverpool now, though Wolves are comfortable playing on the counter-attack. Camacho tries an impatient shot from miles out which drifts well wide.77 min “I read the Hoever in the line up as a typo of Whoever, which I’d presumed was the new form of squad filler, as in the old A.Another when you couldn’t be bothered listing a full squad (for an irrelevant FA Cup match or whatever),” says Justin Kavanagh. “How old is he again?”He hasn’t even been born yet.76 min After an execrable start, this has turned into a decent game. Liverpool are now playing 4-2-3-1, with Firmino behind Salah, Origi on the left and Shaqiri on the right.73 min Jimenez galumphs down the right and crosses towards Cavaleiro at the far post, where Hoever makes an important interception. He’s done so well. It’s one thing to play professional football as a 16-year-old, but to do so at centre-half is beyond. 72 min Ruddy definitely got a touch on that Shaqiri free-kick. It was a monstrously good save.70 min A double change for Liverpool: Salah and Firmino replace Sturridge and Jones, who had a quiet debut.69 min: Shaqiri hits the inside of the post! It was a stunning free-kick, which curled and dipped wickedly before hitting the post, rebounding across the line and spinning behind for a goalkick. I think Ruddy got a fingertip on that if he did, it was an outrageous save.68 min Coady fouls Sturridge 25 yards from goal, slightly to the right of centre - perfect, in other words, for Xherdan Shaqiri...65 min “Sorry Rob, did I miss anything in the first half?” asks Jill O’Donnell. “I was watching Britain’s Busiest Motorway, brilliant episode. This looks like it’s been a decent game!”63 min Camacho, who has been really good in possession, draws a foul from Vinagre with a smart turn. Shaqiri’s inswinger is headed away by Jimenez.62 min “A successful halftime bollocking indeed,” says Charles Antaki. “With some managers, the ranting and raving is hard to picture (Sir Roy, say) but with Klopp I like to imagine the scene involving the best elements of Transformers, The Exorcist, and King Kong, plus a bit of Nosferatu to give it some light and shade.”And at least one lusty, throaty laugh to lighten the mood before he hoofs a teapot at Alberto Moreno’s noggin.61 min The teenager Hoever dithers for a split-second and is robbed by the indefatigable Jimenez, who drags the ball round Mignolet but runs out of room and can only stab it into the side-netting. 57 min “As a Liverpool fan,” says Niall Mullen, “I was wondering: is there any way we can win this game by then not have to play any further games in the F.A.

The Cup has been dead since Manchester United* killed it in 2000 so that England could host the 2006 World Cup (which to be fair was amazing so credit to the FA for choosing to play all the games in Germany).  “*bantz it was already dead” A touch of class from Ruben Neves. He clipped the ball out wide to Vinagre an then ran across to make himself available for the return pass. He had just enough space to get the ball out of his feet and then, as Shaqiri closed in, hit a wobbling, dipping shot from 30 yards that beat Mignolet and flew just inside the near post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0568e59e6e5914f23a0ed592b4e83a7180224d67/0_360_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b96fd108eda1e11126fe87600318a6b6","title":"syrian who lived in airport new life canada hassan al kontar","story":"Stranded in arrivals in Kuala Lumpur for eight months, Hassan al-Kontar was granted asylum to make Whistler his home Hassan al-Kontar has been living in Canada for just under a month. But the Syrian refugee – who made global headlines after becoming stranded in a Malaysian airport for more than eight months in 2018 – is so busy with media requests that he jokes he has only managed to get out into the snow a handful of times.“It’s very much like living in the airport, all the interviews. But obviously you cannot compare the two of them,” says Kontar, 37. “Whistler is an amazing place. There is nothing but nature, fresh air, wonderful people and beautiful snow.”Kontar was working in Dubai when war broke out in Syria in 2011. Knowing he would be forced to fight if he went back home, Kontar stayed in the UAE after his passport and work visa both expired, and was eventually deported to Malaysia. After being refused entry to Cambodia, Ecuador, Malaysia and Turkey, Kontar – a pacifist and minority Druze from Sweida province – found himself stranded in the arrivals section of Kuala Lumpur airport, a transit zone without restaurants or shops. For eight months, he slept under stairwells, showered in a disabled toilet and ate donated airline meals.He feels lucky to have been granted asylum – a status achieved with the help of a few Canadians he calls his “avenger team”, who sponsored him privately for resettlement. Yet he always carries the weight of knowing that though he has made it to safety, many others have not.“The guilt. The guilt is always there,” he sighs. “I am still receiving hate comments, and that is very hard. … But the hate is strong, especially from Malaysia and the Arab world, even from Syria – they always find something to criticise. For some I betrayed my country, for others I’m a coward who ran away from his duties.”He fights the negativity by trying to find solutions. He lobbies on behalf of detainees in Manus Island, Australia’s offshore detention centre, speaks in Canadian schools about his experience and is using his story to push wider knowledge about what is happening back at home in Syria. But he also recognises his own limitations.Kontar is now living with one of own his real-life heroes, Laurie Cooper, a media relations consultant from Whistler who, along with some friends, organised Kontar’s resettlement. Kontar even got his own version of a Hollywood ending to a story that has drawn multiple comparisons to Steven Spielberg’s The Terminal: his asylum papers came through just in time for Christmas.He lives in a log cabin on the edge of the woods with Cooper, her family and their pets, and is treated as a minor celebrity whenever they go into town. “He’s been very warmly welcomed by the community here,” says Cooper. “We cannot walk around the village without people coming up to say hello, give him a hug, welcome him to Whistler, buy him a coffee or give him a high five.”Kontar believes it is people like Cooper, who has helped with more than 30 refugee resettlements to Canada, who will turn things around in a world increasingly hostile to migrants and refugees. “When it comes to organisations, or the United Nations, or global systems, they have failed us – not only us as Syrians but the Yemeni, Iraqi, Rohingya, everyone who needs help,” Kontar says. “I’m trying to focus on the normal people who enjoy their normal lives from their normal living rooms. They can make a difference if they decide to: all we have to do is educate them, enlighten them about what is happening, and show them how they can help.”Kontar has not seen his family for a decade. He watched from afar as friends and family in Syria married and had children. War broke out. His father died. His city came under attack from Isis. And all the while, he was thinking, “I am not there,” he says.“I could not be there. That is a sadness that makes you feel it will never leave you, it will break you or leave you damaged. I feel now like I’m running out of time, like I need to make them happy, like I want them to taste what I’m tasting right now.”The hope is that one day, maybe they will join him in Canada. But for the moment, Kontar is happy to have been adopted into the Cooper family – and the Coopers are glad to have him.“We’d been in almost daily contact for seven months before he was detained and I felt I really knew him, even though we’d never met,” says Cooper. “When I finally gave him a hug, it felt like my son had come home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cab23e3e4135c235209f60d0bcb2d471c32661/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c66be7935ed3210ef8be0ea513395b5b","title":"januhairy great womens armpits not nipple hair","story":"I was a young, hairy girl and I hated it. It is time we got serious about women’s sideburns, ’taches and all the other unexpected sproutingsWomen, throw down your razors: Januhairy is here. This month-long body-hair amnesty is the new Veganuary. Which is the new Dry January. Which, bless, is so retro it doesn’t even get a neologism. And even Brexit got one of those.For the women who have been unwittingly celebrating Januhairy since the moment they caught a glimpse of their leg hair in the wintry split-second between removal of jeans and pulling-on of pyjama bottoms and thought: “Fuck it” … well done. You are ahead of the curve. And probably someone who, like me, reacts to any month-long initiative that is ostensibly designed to improve us, but often results in more shame, in much the same way as misogynists react to a woman with hairy legs.My overall response to Januhairy is … bristly. On the one hand, good for Laura Jackson, the Exeter University student who started the campaign. Just like the hair that never stops growing, this work is never done. We live in a world where a razor advert depicting a woman removing body hair makes the news. It feels ridiculous to say so (pesky internalised misogyny), but it takes genuine guts to go out in summer with bare legs as hairy as mine get. On the other hand, this isn’t exactly a taboo that’s being busted when we’re still illustrating it with that image of Julia Roberts’ hairy pit from the 90s.And isn’t it always armpits? And white women? You don’t often see campaigns for the rights of whiskers, sideburns, taches, and – whisper it – nipple hair. The fact is, not all body hair is deemed equal, or rather, equally disgusting.What is a woman to do but, to the best of her ability, whatever the hell she likes? Like a man with his facial hair, I go through phases. I grow my body hair. I shave it off. As I get older I appear to be growing it more than removing it. But when I was a young, brown, hairy girl, it was a different story. In a natural extension of my self-hatred, I hated my body hair. I shaved my arms and watched in horror as the hair sprouted back thicker and blacker, as though my body was expressing my resistance for me. A boy who bullied me mercilessly mocked my moustache every day. Finally I bought some Jolen cream (because it sounded a bit like the Dolly Parton song) and dyed the hair on my upper lip bright orange. Even the hair-removal creams considered my race a joke, it seemed. I would love to say I marched into school with a flaming tangerine tache and, Anne of Green Gables style, cracked a slate over that boy’s head, but I didn’t. I bought some wax strips."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17cdd63d903bef60090c99cb8a8737b37878b30a/0_653_3280_1967/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30450a4b330215ee9bdd57c50e64a786","title":"david bowie is app review the freakiest show on your smartphone","story":"Released on Bowie’s birthday and narrated by Gary Oldman, the David Bowie Is ... app intends to bring you the gift of sound and vision – but falls a little shortYou have to feel for anyone tasked with designing a David Bowie app, which launches on 8 January, his birthday, priced £7.99. Given the guy was a shape-shifting pop genius who worked 10 steps ahead of his peers, transformed our cultural landscape and even turned his own death into a piece of art, you’re probably not going to get away with throwing up a few annotated pictures. Bowie fans want something that lives up to the icon’s name. No pressure.David Bowie Is … is an app based on the V\u0026ampA’s record-breaking 2013 exhibition of the same name, which toured the world before ending up at New York’s Brooklyn Museum last year. The rather ambitious plan is not just to recreate the experience of going to the exhibition – which focused on the colourful, theatrical side of Bowie and drew a staggering 2m visitors – but to better it. As the creators put it, the app gains you access to all the exhibits: “Without the entire exhibition in the intimacy of your own environment, without glass barriers, vitrines or throngs of visitors.” Who needs people when you’ve got a smartphone?As someone who will happily seize any excuse not to have to mingle with the public, I settled down on the  sofas for a play around. The makers have gone for an augmented reality approach – “staging” the exhibition in front of your camera viewer (that  sofa gets quite psychedelic at times) and allowing you to navigate the items in three dimensions. You progress through the virtual museum’s series of rooms that range from the obvious (“Early influences” “Life on Mars” etc) to the more esoteric (there’s a good one on Kansai Yamamoto, the Japanese fashion designer who created costumes for Bowie’s legendary Aladdin Sane tour). In each room, you’ll find the exhibition’s artefacts – lyric sheets, pop videos, various ephemera, not to mention a huge range of costumes – while Gary Oldman narrates.You can see Bowie’s early sketches proposing outfits for his teenage band the Delta Lemons (brown waistcoats with jeans), watch him perform in the short 1969 film The Mask (A Mime) and see the Warhol-esque lithograph he created of his wife Iman in 1994. In the Blackstar room, we hear him questioned on the subject of religion: “Do you indulge in a form of worship?” he’s asked. “Life,” he answers. “I love life very much indeed.”I found the more obscure rooms the most fascinating. In the Yamamoto room I learn the roots of Bowie’s love of “hikinuki” – the Japanese method of quick costume change that he experimented with during his Aladdin Sane shows at Radio City Music Hall in New York. It was here, while performing half-a-dozen costume changes each night, that he received standing ovations and realised he was on to something. As Bowie himself puts it, he didn’t want to be a radio, but a colour television.The exhibition subscribes to this notion too, and is deep and rich – even after an hour or so messing around I’d barely covered a third of it. It’s great that you can zoom in on lyric sheets and rotate the outlandish costumes a full 360 degrees. But for all the “behind the glass” hype, it’s no match for seeing the costumes in real life – the renderings inevitably lose some of the character. Mingling with the public is unfortunately still the best way to experience this kind of thing.As for the augmented reality interface – it’s both impressive and frustrating. At times you wish it was simpler, as certain artefacts are hard to access and the screen positioning makes viewing them a disorientating experience. You can be forced to hold your phone at awkward angles to get the best view.It’s great that the app invites you to take your time, revisit at your leisure and to take lots of breaks – a welcome antidote to the hectic-pace of most pop culture consumption – but browsing through David Bowie Is … isn’t always the most relaxing experience.Still, for the millions of fans who didn’t get to see the exhibition, or even ones who did but spent most of it trying to crane their neck around someone else’s shoulder, there’s plenty of value to be had in this summation of an artist who was neither a radio nor a colour television but something far more advanced indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfae73c4721585e93640376faf4fea3a96bcbb45/0_92_4353_2612/master/4353.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ea00bef313ecdbe92b3a7d82607b3e6","title":"surviving r kelly documentary lifetime what we can learn","story":"In a new docuseries, the women who have accused the R\u0026ampB singer of sexual assault share their stories with poignant and troubling resultsIt doesn’t take long for the first tears to fall. Backing singer Jovante Cunningham, one of several people featured in new docuseries Surviving R Kelly, is remembering what it was like to work for the R\u0026ampB star and to witness the abuse and manipulation he allegedly wrought on dozens of young women and girls. “We went through a lot. We experienced a lot. We saw a lot.” She’s crying, somehow keeping her voice level. Later, she goes on: “He destroyed a lot of people. I can’t stress to you enough how people are still suffering behind things that went on 20 years ago.”She has just recalled seeing R Kelly and late singer Aaliyah entangled on a tour bus. Her words are “having sex”, but given Aaliyah’s age at the time, per the series, sexual intercourse of any kind would have constituted statutory rape in Illinois (Aaliyah’s mother has since dismissed Cunningham’s account). Like so many interviews from the six-part Lifetime show, Cunningham’s verbal unloading oozes pain, self-examination and the lightest touch of euphemism rooted in wincing away from horrible memories. The show, helmed by critic and film-maker dream hampton, plants its place in an 18-year line of reporting on Kelly’s offstage treatment of women and girls. The allegations themselves – ranging from Kelly soliciting teenage girls for sexual relationships at malls to allegedly running an “abusive cult” – actually date back to 1994. At the time of writing, Kelly is still signed to his record label and denies all the allegations levelled against him.Lifetime has made an impactful series, if at times heavy-handed in its use of sound and visual effects. It twists Kelly’s story and your stomach in knots. Most of the information expressed in Surviving R Kelly has already been made public, largely led by the tireless reporting of Chicago journalist Jim DeRogatis. And so, even when you have turned it off, the docuseries lingers with the stench of unresolved questions: what will happen to the women still believed to be living with Kelly, estranged from their families? What would it take for Kelly’s label, RCA Records, to address the overwhelming testimony made so far? And, finally, where can a viewer direct their rage, when Kelly has proved himself above scrutiny?I’ll be honest: you’ll wait a long while for easy answers to those questions. New information gleaned during the show’s production rarely leaves you feeling satisfied, or as though Kelly has been held fully accountable for the claims about his behaviour. You learn that Kelly used the abortion of survivor Lizzette Martinez, who met him aged 17, as creative fodder to write Michael Jackson’s hit You Are Not Alone. You hear from Demetrius Smith, the simpering former personal assistant who squirms through his memories of watching Kelly, at 27, marry 15-year-old Aaliyah he never explicitly says who forged the documents to state her age as 18.And so the vague edges of knowledge once considered rumour are redrawn firmly, to drive home how the testimony of mostly young black women has been ignored and derided. Those who read Kelly’s 2012 memoir Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me will already know that he has said he was sexually abused as a child by an older woman for several years (“I remember it feeling weird. I remember feeling ashamed.”) You’ll have seen the fans who backed Kelly during his much delayed child abuse images case in 2008. But hearing directly from former fan Jerhonda Pace flips that perspective anew. She met Kelly outside the courthouse aged 14, and says he later emotionally abused her in his Atlanta home, slapping, choking and spitting on her. Essentially, Surviving R Kelly brings to life the women whose voices DeRogatis quoted in print for years – most recently and vividly with his 2017 BuzzFeed investigation about the “sex cult” that women allege Kelly runs.If you have followed the social media response to the show, you will have noticed several of the 40-plus people interviewed – cultural commentators, activists, psychologists, survivors – deal with a blend of victim-blaming and whataboutery, from those who think Kelly has being wrongfully singled out as a black man. Those people fail to see that Kelly isn’t being paraded around as some sort of bogeyman, while white abusers avoid scrutiny. Instead, women such as his ex-wife Andrea Kelly, who met him at 19 while auditioning as a dancer, and Kitti Jones, introduced to him aged 33, are finally granted the chance to look down a lens and tell their stories so that you can see them.Hampton saw the whataboutery coming. “I knew that essentially what we had from the survivors was incredibly compelling, honest evidence,” she said to ThinkProgress. “It needed context. It needed to live in the larger world we all live in: of racism, sexism, capitalism. We needed to talk about the record industry who considered this man a cash cow, and who will always look away.” About that. RCA Records are yet to respond to the fallout from the film, though may be playing it legally safe to avoid being sued by Kelly. Let this be clear: Surviving R Kelly has no solutions to magically fix the problem of the music industry and black American community averting their eyes from the allegations against Kelly. But it is giving a mainstream voice to black and brown women who’ve lacked one.So the show arrives at a confusing, and confused, time. Collectively, we don’t really understand how to deal with abusers who manage to avoid further scrutiny and career censure. Sceptics are quick to shout “Did you call the police?” when women share stories of sexual misconduct, abuse or harassment. But what happens when video evidence and verbal testimony aren’t enough to incriminate? Kelly’s a prime example: he was never tried on rape charges, and a jury instead acquitted him in 2008 on all 14 child abuse images charges, even after viewing the so-called “sex tape” that prompted his arrest in 2002.It’s more than a year since black activist and Surviving contributor Tarana Burke’s #MeToo movement (often wrongfully credited to Alyssa Milano) came to be seen by many as a 2017 invention linked to the Harvey Weinstein revelations. And still, we flounder and argue when faced with the men who make art and money and connections, yet allegedly hurt women. This is really about trauma, falling in a grey area more nuanced than current legal terms. We need an understanding deeper than the confines of rape and consent laws developed hundreds of years ago by men. In the meantime, you get to decide whether to turn away from, or listen to, the voices that accompany the tears."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d0174e5043327ffc821f9e7c1ca59225a688c8c/27_31_1134_680/master/1134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=160ac65ccb39eab1ccbb85ac78234d56","title":"iran digging diplomatic grave over nazanin zaghari ratcliffe says emily thornberry","story":"Shadow foreign secretary says treatment of British-Iranian is ‘nothing but barbaric’Iran is digging its own diplomatic grave by punishing the jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after it cut both her food rations and access to medical treatment for a lump on her breast, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has said.The family of the 40-year-old, who has been detained in Iran since 2016, said last week that she intended to begin a hunger strike on Monday 14 January alongside her fellow inmate and human rights activist Narges Mohammadi.The two women have been requesting medical treatment promised to them by a prison doctor, but denied by the Iranian prison authorities.Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s weekly Sunday phonecall with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has since been cut as well as her medical rations.Alistair Burt, the Middle East minister, who was speaking in the Commons on Monday, insisted her access to medicines was of “supreme importance” to the UK, and said pressure was being applied on the Iranian government to allow British officials consular access to her in prison. He said Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release may change perceptions of Iran.Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s MP, Tulip Siddiq, said her treatment was “becoming a matter of life and death”, and called on the foreign ministry to summon the Iranian ambassador to the UK and to demand the issue was debated at the UN security council. “Tough rhetoric is not enough”, said Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead.Thornberry, in some of her most pointed remarks to the Iranian government, described the mistreatment of Zaghari-Ratcliffe as “a cruel and vengeful response”. She said the mistreatment of any prisoner was inhumane, but said in the context of her medical and physical condition, “her treatment is nothing but barbaric”.She added: “it was necessary for the Iranians to restore not just her basic rights, but her freedom without delay.”Iran faced a twin economic and military threat this year, Thornberry noted, from the US economic sanctions and dangerous military escalation. She said: “Iran will need us to fight on their behalf to preserve the nuclear deal, to preserve trade and stop the descent into war. Tehran needs to hear this. Every day Nazanin’s inhumane treatment continues, every time we see fresh human rights abuses in Iran, it makes it more and more difficult to summon the stomach for that fight.“When the Foreign Office says Iran is holding Nazanin for diplomatic advantage, Tehran needs to realise that in fact, the opposite is true. For her every day they continue her unjust detention, they are simply burying their own diplomatic grave.”The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has been in contact with the family 11 times since August, and made her plight a highlight of his one-day visit to Tehran.The Iranian news agency Fars reported on Sunday that the Iranian judicial spokesman, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, criticised Hunt for threatening Iran over Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19748b54c2c8561173bdf96e1aa901124b7dff9a/0_0_3500_2253/master/3500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=68c7851828adf4e2c4e0b674b7279755 1400w","title":"grayling makes even the most mediocre of ministers feel good","story":"Stephen Barclay may be a clueless Brexit secretary but at least he didn’t spend £50K on failing to organise a lorry jam Finally we have a confirmed use for Chris Grayling. He is the government’s secret weapon to make even the most incompetent and second-rate of ministers feel good about themselves. Not content with having wasted the best part of £14m on the government’s first-ever roll-on, roll-off pizza delivery service – all toppings guaranteed to be ferry free, the transport secretary has now spent more than £50K on failing to organise a lorry jam in Kent.If the aim has been to make clear to the EU that the country is willing to spend any amount of money to prove we are totally unprepared for a no-deal Brexit, it is job done. Failing Grayling wears his hopelessness as a badge of honour. A man who lives and breathes the Samuel Beckett maxim: “Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” An inspiration to the mediocre that complete catatonia is within their grasp. Even without the use of performance decreasing drugs.The Brexit secretary certainly appeared immensely grateful to Grayling, as he was called to the dispatch box to answer an urgent question on what progress the government had made in its renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement since it pulled the vote several weeks before Christmas. Stephen Barclay had previously never dared to dream of being anything more than the nonentities’ nonentity and finding himself in the cabinet has prompted an identity crisis. He now affects the swagger of a somebody but has the personality and intelligence of a nobody.Still, knowing next to nothing about anything is no real disadvantage when it comes to the Brexit negotiations as no one else in government has a clue either, so Barclay was free to make things up as he went along. There had been some progress and there again there hadn’t been some progress, he said gnomically, while repeatedly reassuring himself under his breath that at least he wasn’t Failing Grayling. There might be some news by Wednesday and if there wasn’t, then there might be by a following Wednesday. “I’m not Chris Grayling, I’m not Chris Grayling,” he mumbled, dying on his feet.Jeremy Corbyn was more relaxed about Barclay not being Grayling. His fury was directed at Barclay not being Theresa May. The Labour leader had directed his question at the prime minister and it was a dereliction of duty she had sent a stand-in instead. It’s a sign of the general levels of Brexit madness that Corbyn believed he had lost out by not getting May’s version of events. No one has ever come away better informed about anything after 90 minutes in the company of the prime minister.Apart from being angry about May’s absence, Corbyn wasn’t quite sure what he was actually angry about. All he knew for certain was that he was definitely angry. He shouted a bit, stumbled over his script – it was his first day back since Christmas so a little rustiness was to be expected – and generally demanded levels of clarity that were well beyond anything he could offer himself. The Labour leader might even have been taking lessons off Grayling.What followed was an exercise in futility. Sensibly, no members of the DUP even bothered to turn up. With just 81 days till Brexit, parliament is still quite happy to waste its own and the country’s time. Barclay managed to both confirm that the prime minister would and wouldn’t present her new legal agreement before the debate restarted on Wednesday and that the vote would and wouldn’t definitely go ahead next week.Not that anyone was listening. Or cared. Everyone who had always promised to vote against the deal anyway, merely confirmed they would do so regardless of what May said or did. “We have no plan,” wailed Labour’s Barry Sheerman. “We have no purpose.” He wailed for all of us. Though quite why it has taken him so long to realise this is a mystery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c8bbc7ed595ad5b85e5747bb2c127783aa44c22/0_117_3568_2141/master/3568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91d7fe9f2b5a1a3ccb5b18f995a9aaa1","title":"labour backs cross party amendment to block no deal brexit","story":"Frontbench likely to whip MPs to back amendment tabled by Yvette CooperTheresa May’s Brexit preparations could be thrown into fresh difficulty on Tuesday, with Labour poised to support a backbench amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper that could restrict the government’s tax powers unless a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table.The government may be forced to concede after the Labour frontbench suggested it was likely to whip its MPs to back the cross-party amendment to the finance bill, significantly increasing its chances of success in the Commons. Around a dozen Tory MPs have signalled their intention to back the amendment.Downing Street and Treasury sources suggested on Monday night that the material affect of the amendment on no-deal preparations for tax administration would be inconvenience rather than disaster.The instinct in No 10 is to ride out the possible damage and push ahead with the vote on the finance bill on Tuesday, though it is undecided if Tory MPs will be whipped to oppose the amendment or if the government will concede to avoid a defeat.Yet the amendment’s supporters are also understood to see it as a vehicle to demonstrate the strength of parliamentary opposition to no deal. MPs are also beginning preparations to target other bills with similar amendments that would give parliament more levers to avert a no-deal Brexit.Downing Street announced on Monday that there were seven bills that have to be implemented in order to provide a smooth exit, including trade, agriculture, healthcare, financial services, fisheries and immigration, as well as legislation for the withdrawal agreement.Writing for the , Cooper said there was a growing danger that “brinkmanship, political paralysis, siren voices” could lead the UK over a Brexit cliff-edge.“Just because most people don’t want something to happen, doesn’t mean it won’t,” she said. “So it is with a no-deal Brexit. I believe the majority of MPs, ministers and most people across the UK are opposed to the self-inflicted damage to our economy and security that would result from crashing out of the EU.”The amendment has the backing of a number of Labour and Conservative select committee chairs, including Tories Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, Labour’s Hilary Benn and Frank Field, the pro-Brexit chair of the work and pensions select committee. Former minister Nick Boles and Tory grandees Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicholas Soames have also given their support.The House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, must rule on whether to accept the amendment ahead of the finance bill debate on Tuesday but it is understood to have a high chance of selection if the debate goes ahead.Cooper said the amendment had support from MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate, including from those committed to backing May’s deal and those opposing it. “It doesn’t avoid the difficult debates and disagreements ahead over the best way forward, but it at least gives us the chance to rule out the worst outcome,” she said.The amendment to the finance bill would be attached to a clause designed to give the government the power to keep tax law working in the event of a no-deal Brexit.If it were passed, it would mean that clause would only be allowed to come into force if there were either a Brexit deal, a decision to extend article 50, or a vote in the Commons specifically approving a no-deal Brexit. It is this format of three options that MPs may later decide to attempt to apply to other bills going through the Commons.Morgan said it was time for parliament to create a mechanism to stop no deal by default. “Many of us have been clear that parliament will not allow a no-deal situation to unfold, and with less than 12 weeks to go until 29 March it is time for parliament to show our opposition to a no-deal exit,” she said.Experts and Whitehall sources are ided about the effectiveness of the amendment. One Treasury source said: “It makes things more difficult but compared to the general effect of no deal, it adds to problems but it is quite a long way down. It does not stop no deal.”Nikki da Costa, the former Downing Street head of legislative affairs who has extensive experience navigating the difficult parliamentary arithmetic since 2017, said the Treasury would have to weigh up if the powers could be reinstated via another route.“The easiest route is to see if those powers really are essential and how quickly they may be needed,” Da Costa said, saying she believed the actual effect to be “relatively minor”.“If those amendments, for example to EU references in tax law, aren’t really problematic, and you can afford not to amend for some time after exit day, then you might just accept the amendment and find another legislative vehicle at a later date.”Other efforts are also under way to demonstrate the extent of parliamentary opposition to a no-deal Brexit. Some of the 200 MPs who signed a letter organised by Tory ex-minister Dame Caroline Spelman and Labour’s Jack Dromey, calling for May to rule out a no-deal Brexit, are set to meet the prime minister on Tuesday.Separately, Labour is expected to face renewed attempts by grassroots party members to back a second referendum this week. Left-wing activists from the anti-Brexit group Another Europe is Possible have organised for members for more than two hundred 200 local parties to submit pro-referendum motions for the party’s national policy forum on Wednesday.The party’s policy cannot be officially changed again until its 2019 conference, which will happen after the UK is expected to have left the EU, but organisers hope that the sheer number of motions submitted for debate at the policy forum will have heavy symbolism in the crucial weeks ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e09213b6c3a99911f887ce2894dbc5f4f2c88c2e/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c55bdd72a92ced84e07c4c9f974ffd02","title":"no deal brexit rehearsal tests traffic congestion in kent","story":"Only 89 trucks take part in trial of emergency traffic system designed to cope with 6,000 vehicles A live rehearsal of an emergency traffic system that will be put in place to prevent congestion in Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit has been described as “a waste of time” by drivers participating in the test in Kent on Monday.The Road Haulage Association said the dry run of a contingency traffic plan for the port was “too little, too late”.The location for the Department for Transport’s trial was a disused airport north of the Kent port that was once used to test the bouncing bombs employed in the Dambuster raids in the second world war.Under contingency plans, Manston airport will be used as a parking facility for 6,000 lorries, but only 89 participated in the trial staged at 8am on Monday.The drivers, paid £550 each by the government, started their journey at dawn at the airport, where they queued before being given the go-ahead to drive to a second holding area, a three-mile stretch of the A256, which had been coned-off to normal traffic.From there they were directed en masse to Dover, Britain’s biggest roll-on-roll-off port that handles about 10,000 lorries a day.After the first dry run drivers said while it was good the government was doing something the exercise was so small it was pointless.“It’s a waste of time. They should have done it in rush-hour. You can see the traffic here is just average. This is not what it will be like in no-deal,” said Adam Carter, a driver with Int Logistics.It took about an hour for lorries to make the 20-mile journey to Dover and it appeared to go smoothly with no queues evident en route.“To be honest, it was a waste of time. At least they have done something and it worked, but 80 trucks from our point of view isn’t testing the system,” said David Martin, who is also a driver with Int Logistics.He said the government’s contingency plan would create huge expense for drivers in petrol and other costs, particularly those who would be forced to go to Manston airport even if their final transit point was the Eurotunnel, several miles up the coast from Dover.“When you’re doing that extra 40 miles two or three times a week and at eight miles to the gallon, it all adds up,” added Martin, whose company transports frozen and chilled food including cheese and yoghurt from the continent to British supermarkets.The Calais politician Xavier Bertrand has said a two-minute delay would lead to a 27,000-strong queue on both sides of the channel.And the Road Haulage Association has said the documentation required if the UK leaves the single market is so impractical it would take eight hours per truck to complete. The challenge facing the government and Kent county council was evident at dawn as an argument broke out between marshals about where the trucks were supposed to go.The association described the test as “window dressing”, saying it could not possibly mimic the reality of 6,000 trucks that would be held at Manston airport in the event of no deal.“This is designed to test what happens if there is no deal and Operation Brock is implemented,” said a spokesman referring to the codename for the Brexit traffic management plan.Kent county council has warned a no-deal Brexit could cause major disruption across Kent, with gridlock on the roads around Dover.Rod McKenzie, the managing director of policy for the Road Haulage Association, said the rehearsal was too limited in scope.“Critics might call it window dressing,” he said. “With 89 trucks, in no way can it replicate a potential 6,000 trucks that might need to be held in or around Kent and Manston. This planning should have been done many months ago, and preferably on a bigger scale. It should have been continuous and stress-tested, I doubt many truck drivers will be impressed by this.“What we need is a deal or at least a transition deal. Business is simply not ready for a cliff-edge Brexit,” he said.Local driver Jim Andrews said it was a good idea to use the route from Manston airport but questioned the leadership of Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, on no-deal planning for Kent, which will bear the brunt of traffic disruption.“I love my country, but we are a nation of lions led by donkeys. Nobody asks us, the people in Kent, the drivers, what we think,” said Andrews, a supporter of Brexit.Neil Wheeler, an NHS security official who was at a truckers’ stop along the route, said he was concerned about emergency services. “If you have gridlock and you have an accident on the road, I do not see how you will be able to get to hospital,” he said.Staff at the nearby McDonalds said local drivers had steered clear of the area this morning. “Everyone knew this was happening, so stayed away. It’s been very quiet,” said one.A DfT spokesman said it did not expect a no-deal scenario, but it was “the duty of a responsible government to continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies, including a possible no deal”.He added that “any lessons learned from today and further mitigation measures will be considered carefully” to ensure the system was fully functional if needed.

And it doesn’t have to break the bank.Scattering plants around the officeYou don’t need to be a botanist to realise the positive effect plants can have on an environment, and the workplace is no different. Plants that have been shown to have a de-stressing effect include aloe vera, peace lilies, bamboo palm, spider plants and rubber trees. Try dotting a few of these on your desk and around the office and see what the effect is on people’s moods.Allowing petsThe act of stroking a dog has been shown to increase levels of a hormone called oxytocin in both the dog and the human, while reducing cortisol levels in the person, too. Oxytocin is a happy hormone, whereas, cortisol is related to stress. So stroking dogs makes you happier and less stressed.At the UK Mars Petcare offices, dogs are a constant feature. “What’s amazing about having dogs in the office is the genuine relationship of support that can build over time between people and pets,” says Essler, who also works at a pet care company.“I often notice people taking short breaks in their day to stroke, cuddle or play with the dogs, which relieves their stress and over time builds a positive bond with the dog,” she says. “This unconditional relationship is extremely beneficial in challenging environments and often I see dogs seeking to comfort those who are having a difficult day.”Creating a stress-free zoneTaking time away from the threat – or perceived threat – that’s making you stressed has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to overcome it. This is why having a separate area that people can go to when they feel overwhelmed will help improve the wellbeing of people in your office. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy it might be a coffee area or simply a corner of the office with beanbags or cushions.Socialising“We’re only a small team, but spending time together outside of the workplace to relax, bond, laugh and reflect has improved productivity and team dynamics endlessly,” says Ben Barker, founder of cold-brew coffee company Artemis Brew.“It can be as simple, cheap and non-disruptive as you make it,” he says. His team has been to events such as escape rooms and independent film festivals, and it usually involves a beer or two afterwards.Playing musicMusic can be comforting, relaxing and it has been shown to increase productivity. Instead of having everyone listening to their own music through headphones, try playing music in your office to help people feel less stressed.“We have the radio playing in all areas of the building,” says Tracey Dawson, managing director at Daletech Electronics, a company with 14 employees.Or, if you’re in the mood for something a bit different, why not try a podcast?“We love having music on in the office, but more recently we’ve been putting podcasts on, too, which are a great alternative,” says James Gupta, founder and CEO at Synap, an online education platform.Communication is keyMaking sure everyone knows what is going on helps to manage stress, says Gupta. “At the beginning of every week, we have a team meeting to discuss what we’ll each be working on,” he says. “The development team get to see how their work is being received by customers, and the sales team have an understanding of when new features are likely to be available.”Provide healthy snacks“We try to encourage active, healthy lifestyles, so we supply free fruit and we have a company lunch together once a week,” says Dawson.Healthy eating has been shown to help stress levels decrease, and if someone is working to a deadline, having a quick, healthy snack might be exactly what they need to get through a busy morning. Offering caffeine-free alternatives to tea and coffee can also help keep tempers from boiling over and keep the jitters at bay.Celebrate success“Celebrating success is important,” says Gillian Rattray, entrepreneur acceleration manager at Royal Bank of Scotland.Recognising small wins such as hitting certain revenue targets or securing an important meeting helps even out the rollercoaster of running a business. “At the moment, we are looking carefully at celebration,” says Dawson. “As a first step, we have installed a ship’s bell that we ring each time an order leaves the building.”“In my own business, we had fizz days – we bought a bottle of sparkling wine when we made £1,000 or more in a day,” says Rattray. “The more revenue we earned, the more fizz we bought!”SEAT believes in helping people move forward.

When challenged on their reluctance to be tied down, half-hearted partners could shrug and claim their neural gene expression profiles made them that way.That is, at least, if research on smaller animals holds true in humans. Researchers who compared the DNA of 10 different species found a common genetic formula which marked out males that stayed with their mates and lent a hand from their less-than-committed cousins.The work suggests evolution hit on the same biological trick to make certain species monogamous, by turning up the activity of some genes in their brains, and turning down the activity of others.“We show that very similar gene expression mechanisms are involved in the transition from a non-monogamous species to a monogamous species,” said Rebecca Young, a biologist at the University of Texas at Austin. “It is utilised over and over again.”Monogamy can be defined in many ways, but in the latest research the scientists focused on animals that paired up for at least one mating season, shared at least some parental care duties and joined forces to defend their offspring against predators.They identified five monogamous species and for each found a close relative with a far more promiscuous lifestyle. The monogamous animals included California mice, prairie voles, water pipits, mimic poison frogs and a cichlid fish from Lake Tanganyika in Africa. The promiscuous cousins were deer mice, meadow voles, dunnocks, strawberry poison frogs and a similar species of African cichlid.The animals are separated by 450m years of evolution and developed their monogamous behaviour independently on distinct branches of the evolutionary tree.Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers describe how they analysed brain tissue from the animals and found 24 genes whose activity was consistently ramped up or dampened down in the monogamous species. The two dozen genes are those most strongly linked to monogamy, with the total number potentially being in the hundreds, Young said.The study found that genes involved in neural development, cell signalling, learning, memory and cognitive function were all more active in monogamous males compared with more promiscuous ones. The ramped up genes might help animals recognise their partners and offspring, or the home they share.While the research cannot pinpoint monogamy genes with certainty – the animals in question differ in more ways than their reproductive habits – the scientists believe they have taken a useful first step. Future studies can now tweak gene expression in animals to see if it makes monogamous species promiscuous and vice versa.It takes complex forces of evolution to shape an animal’s reproductive strategy. And while monogamy has clear advantages for some species, it has downsides too. “You have to tolerate another animal next to you for an extended period of time and that is not easy,” said Hans Hoffman, a senior author on the paper. “They may take away your food, they may take away your shelter, they may make you sick with their germs, or hurt you.”And then there is the burden of caring for young. “Offspring are parasites. They eat you, they take your resources, they make your life more dangerous because it is easier for a predator to find you,” Hoffman said.All of which makes it a wonder that any species makes monogamy work. But this is where evolution played its best trick of all. “What evolution came up with is brilliant,” Hoffman said. “When we enter into a pair bond, or have offspring we must take care of, we find it rewarding. The reward system gets hijacked. It says, ‘Hey, I love this shit.’”It is not known whether the same genes have any bearing on monogamous behaviour in humans. If they do, could a genetic test for monogamy be on the cards? “Monogamy is a complex trait with many, many genes involved,” said Young. “There are differences among iniduals and a test may have to be very inidualised to be effective. Is it impossible? I’d never say that.”But she cautioned that monogamy was not the same as faithfulness. “Whether the societal definition of human monogamy agrees with our operational definition is a can of worms,” she said.“There are some really cool implications of this,” said David Westneat, who studies the biology of social behaviour at the University of Kentucky. “One is that the switch between monogamy and non-monogamy is employing the same general system across all vertebrates.”Another is that the switch between monogamous and non-monogamous behaviour is “ecologically sensitive”. He said: “This would suggest that one could take the subject species in this study and make them express the opposite pattern by shifting the ecology in which they live.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92f9e23f51d9b3619fa464b70373ba0c4673e7a5/0_979_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9505c6d6778fb2e3504ea10fa9bb1a5f","title":"gene editing could create spicy tomatoes say researchers","story":"Scientists also looking at altering colour of kiwis and taste of strawberriesSpicy tomatoes could soon be on the menu thanks to the rise of genome-editing technology, say researchers.It is not the first time experts have claimed the techniques could help to precisely and rapidly develop fruits and vegetables with unusual traits: scientists have already been looking at changing the colour of kiwi fruits and tweaking the taste of strawberries.But researchers in Brazil and Ireland say such methods also could offer practical advantages, with spicy tomatoes offering a way of harvesting capsaicinoids, the pungent chemicals found in chilli peppers.Writing in the Trends in Plant Science journal, the researchers say chilli peppers are labour-intensive and difficult crops to cultivate, and it is tricky to keep the pungency of the fruits consistent.Tomatoes and chilli peppers developed from a common ancestor but erged about 19m years ago.“All the genes to produce capsaicinoids exist in the tomato, they are just not active,” Zsögön said. Using a gene-editing technology, such as a variation of Crispr-Cas9, it would be possible to switch these genes back on in tomatoes, adding a kick to the everyday fruit, he said. Zsögön and his team are already working on the feat, and say they hope to have some news by the end of the year.Zsögön added the endeavour was also about showing that genome engineering is a useful tool, and helping people to accept the technology.Zsögön said he was personally looking forward to hot tomatoes to make guacamole, but added that it might be best if the spicy produce did not end up at Spain’s annual tomato-throwing competition. “There could be injuries,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e86bd9a4b17dc6dc44389873456aa8dcb5e19ff/1580_441_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c94a7c18a7e8b15dc6efae238f801cc1","title":"ferrri principal maurizio arrivabene mattia binotto","story":"The Ferrari Formula One team have replaced their team principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, with Mattia Binotto, their chief technical officer. The team had earlier denied there was any change of leadership expected but after failing to mount a season-long challenge to Mercedes in 2018 Arrivabene has been dispensed with after four years in charge – and only two months before the new F1 season begins.Arrivabene has most recently overseen two years when the Scuderia were found wanting against Mercedes. Last year was a particular disappointment: despite having the quicker car for considerable periods, a series of driver errors by Sebastian Vettel were compounded by team mistakes that saw their challenge falter and Lewis Hamilton taking the title with two races remaining.“After four years of untiring commitment and dedication Maurizio Arrivabene is leaving the team,” Ferrari said in a statement. “The decision was taken together with the company’s top management after lengthy discussions related to Maurizio’s long-term personal interests as well as those of the team itself. Ferrari would like to thank Maurizio for his valuable contribution to the team’s increasing competitiveness over the past few years and wish him the best for his future endeavours. With immediate effect Mattia Binotto will take over as Scuderia Ferrari’s team principal.”Arrivabene, who is 61, joined Ferrari in 2014 having previously been vice-president at the tobacco company Philip Morris, a long-term sponsor of the team. Vettel was responsible for some of their failings in 2018 but the team notably let him down operationally, failing to institute clear orders on occasion and making the wrong tyre choice in qualifying in Japan, an error for which Arrivabene turned on his team.Binotto is understood to have been favoured by the former Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne and has extensive pedigree. He joined Ferrari as test race engineer in 1995 and has since been race engine engineer, race engineer and head of engines before being made chief technical officer in 2016, a role in which he has been credited with returning Ferrari to the front of the grid.

On Saturday night, an alleged mugger managed to pick out a UFC fighter among those multitudes.UFC strawweight Polyana Viana says she was waiting for an Uber when she was approached by a man claiming to have a gun. The results weren’t pretty. “He was really close to me. So I thought, ‘If it’s a gun, he won’t have time to draw it.’ So I stood up. I threw two punches and a kick. He fell, then I caught him in a rear-naked choke. Then I sat him down in the same place we were before and said, ‘Now we’ll wait for the police.’”Viana posted photos, which later appeared on UFC president Dana White’s Instagram feed, of her bloodied and bruised alleged attacker. She kept him in a hold until police arrived. She says the man’s wounds were treated before he was taken to the station, where Viana filed a police report.“I was fine,” Viana said. “I was fine because he didn’t even react after. Since he took the punches very quickly, I think he was scared. So he didn’t react anymore. He told me to let him go, like ‘I just asked for the time.’ I said, ‘Asked for the time my ass,’ because he saw I was very angry. I said I wouldn’t let go and that I was going to call the police.

Nothing else mattered. That’s why it became too much, maybe. That’s why I suffered,” Simona Halep says intently on a midwinter afternoon in Bucharest. We sit in a corner of a restaurant where the clinking of cutlery provides a refined backdrop to the raw immediacy of a rare interview with the world No 1.There is snow on the ground outside but only warmth from Halep. Beyond her burning intensity she smiles with relief. “There is no pressure now. I feel lighter. I feel better. I wouldn’t have been this relaxed if I hadn’t won the French Open. A big weight is off my shoulders.”The 27-year-old has avoided opening up before because, apart from her shy and private nature, she was consumed by a fixation that was finally quenched in Paris last summer when winning her first grand slam. Halep can now offer insight into her life in Bucharest.We meet at 9am and she chats cheerfully while we are driven to an indoor court on the outskirts of the city. I watch her practise for the Australian Open, which begins next week in the contrasting furnace of Melbourne, where Halep suffered so much last year. On the way to lunch, with Halep drained after playing hard for two hours, she finds pleasure in the simple fact she spent her first Christmas at home in 10 years.Halep now appears the opposite of a one-dimensional obsessive. Instead, as she reflects on the dedication needed to reach her goals, she talks expansively about physical trauma, psychological barriers, the role of her former coach Darren Cahill and the sweetness of victory.Cahill will spend most of this year with his family in Australia and so Halep is currently without a coach. This unusual situation adds to the fascination as to whether, while returning from a back injury and exhaustion after her momentous 2018, she can become an even better player.Halep’s psychological resolve has been tested but at last year’s Australian Open she was subjected to a physical battering that meant she was taken to hospital after her draining three-set defeat in the final against Caroline Wozniacki. The entire tournament had been an ordeal. “I have never played such a tough tournament and I hope I will not have to again,” she says. “It was a disaster. My mum was scared and she said I must never do that again because it was too much. It was a warning.”She had twisted her ankle badly in the first round but struggled on to win that match and the next one before facing Lauren Davis. They played for three hours 45 minutes in searing heat, costing Davis some of her toenails, before Halep won 15-13 in the final set. “That was amazing,” Halep says. “She played so well and had three match points. But I think I had more desire to win. That match meant a lot because mentally I was strong. I could stay so many hours on court.”Halep survived another epic in the semi-finals, saving two match points and beating Angelique Kerber 9-7 in the third set, where “it felt like every point was 20 rallies because she’s a very big fighter. I was proud of that tournament. I was not even upset after I lost to Caroline in the final. I gave everything. But there was no more energy at the end.Just over four months later, in Paris, she was tested mentally rather than just physically. A fourth successive defeat in a major final would have felt ruinous – especially as Halep had lost the French Open the previous year when a set and 3-0 up in the final against Jelena Ostapenko. “I have the courage to say I lost that final,” she says. “She won it in the end because she was great and when you are young you just play. I lost it because I couldn’t handle the emotions. For the next three months, I cannot use the word ‘depressed’ because it’s too much, but I was sad for a long time.”In the 2018 French Open final, Halep was a set and 2-0 down to an inspired Sloane Stephens. “I didn’t expect her to play so well on clay so I thought everything will be lost again,” she says. “I said I have to try something so I was more aggressive. I went to the net three times in one game, which I never do. I won the game and I had the confidence because I thought about the year before when I was leading and lost it. I really believed then.”Halep’s face lights up as she remembers how 20 years of grinding work had finally given her the ultimate happiness she craved on court. “Everything I had dreamed was real in that moment. All the people I love were there and when I lift the trophy, and the national song is played, it was the best moment I ever had. I was crying because it was huge. Maybe it will be my best moment as an athlete. But let’s see. Maybe the future will give me even more.”That future is made intriguing by Halep’s decision not to replace Cahill immediately. In explaining how much he helped her overcome mentally, Halep suggests her personal challenge is shared by many Romanians. “People here don’t believe in themselves much. We are very talented but we don’t have confidence. I was lucky. Darren is Australian and totally different. He pushed me to be positive. I changed a lot.”Can she succeed without a coach? “No, I need to find a coach. At this level it is impossible to go alone.” Will she and Cahill be reunited? “I don’t know. I can say I hope so because he’s a great person and that matters the most.”Her rise is remarkable because, apart from her Romanian background giving her few advantages, Halep’s character was perhaps not one of a typical sportsperson. “Sometimes I was crying that I don’t want to go on the court because I was too shy,” she says. “I was very introverted. I am still an introvert.”Halep smiles when I say she has been confident and revealing in this interview. “I am open now. I improved a lot and I can be more natural.”She has begun to support young Romanian players hoping to make it on the pro circuit. “I received a lot from tennis so it’s good to help others because it’s very difficult. Many talented kids get lost because they don’t have the money. Tennis is an expensive sport in Romania.”Halep also supports a girls’ ice hockey team. “I am paying for everything they need – equipment, coaches, some tournaments outside of Romania. They started to beat the boys so it’s good. Sometimes I go see them for the energy and to get motivated.”“Now I would love to be better in Fed Cup, to dream of the title, and the Olympics in 2020. I also want to win a grand slam again, to finish No 1 again. But I won’t put pressure on myself. I will have few more years of tennis and then I want to improve in other ways.

The play is a monologue of his backstory, delivered in his dressing room, and he enters just after extracting himself from his fans.The stage is set for a focused character study – a piece of theatre about a life in theatre – and that is just what we get as the dame wipes off his “battle face” and the real Ronald is revealed. Camp bonhomie dissolves into misty-eyed vignettes and then, perhaps too predictably, his story takes darker turns into a tormented childhood from which he finds escape in performance and drag in later life.Duncan is a pantomime stalwart and brings a bright-eyed “show-must-go-on” stoicism to his role, but for all his physical energy, he lacks both the archness and the vulnerability needed to bring his character, and his anguished past, truly alive. His singing voice becomes fainter as the production goes on, to reflect a breathless performer well past his prime, but these deliberately faltering moments do not contain enough emotional purchase.Ronald’s childhood of family abuse, separation and loss is affecting but verges on the generic narrative of a child performer, pushed on to the stage by an overbearing and violent father with a loving but undermined mother in the shadows.The script pays homage to music-hall greats from Charlie Chaplin to Dan Leno but these interludes feel bolted on, taking us outside Ronald’s story, and the potted biographies of these inwardly troubled comic geniuses rehearse the over-familiar idea of the tears of a clown. There are some lovely moments nonetheless, such as Duncan’s sparky turns as Widow Twankey and Dame Trott and his poignant rendition of Look for the Silver Lining. Peter Humphrey’s set comprises a dressing room filled with bonnets, dresses and a light-bulb mirror, and it reeks of the magic of theatre but also the faded glory of seaside entertainment. Most of all, Duncan’s performance is heroic in its heartfelt earnestness, even if this feels by the end like a play whose parts have not quite come together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e52fb7454f217de6cb8f78ec5885bb8692b6e8/0_69_2071_1243/master/2071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e259990db7ea7c4dc19ebf87fa8d328","title":"tell us about a great retreat experience for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Whether it was yoga or mindfulness, painting or running, we’d love to hear about retreats worldwide that have soothed, inspired or made you thinkMaybe you rebooted your mind with a meditation holiday, kickstarted an exercise campaign or spent a week immersed in learning a new skill.

Ankara sees those forces as a branch of militant Kurdish insurgent inside Turkey and describes them as terrorists.Against a backdrop of friction and uncertainty, it is unclear who Bolton will be seeing in Ankara. No meetings had been confirmed by Monday afternoon.The Pentagon was initially told to plan for the withdrawal of US soldiers within 100 days. But during to a visit to Jerusalem on Sunday, Bolton said the withdrawal would depend on conditions inside Syria and on Turkish actions.“There are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal,” Bolton said.“Timetables or the timing of the withdrawal occurs as a result of the fulfillment of the conditions and the establishment of the circumstances that we want to see. And once that’s done, then you talk about a timetable.”Bolton said that one of those conditions would be the total destruction of Isis, who the president had claimed had already been defeated.“It’s very clear, we’re going to withdraw, we’re going to protect American forces during the withdrawal period, but the president also expects it would be able to accomplish the destruction of the Isis territorial caliphate, and other Isis personnel and facilities that are potentially dangerous to us as we leave,” Bolton said.US troops, as well as special forces from the UK and France, have fought alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to oust Isis from almost all its “caliphate” in Syria. The SDF is led by the Kurdish Protection Units (YPG) which has strong links with Kurdish Workers’ party (PKK) militants in Turkey, a source of constant tension between Ankara and Washington.“The issue is PKKYPG are making efforts to establish an order by oppressing Kurds who don’t obey them, and by their terrorist activities against our country,” Kalin said, in a rebuke to Bolton. “There is no doubt that a terror group cannot be an ally of the US.”“There is deep disappointment in Ankara with the US administration, and right now Turkish policy-makers are trying to assess whether this is a policy shift or whether it is empty words and the policy will change again,” Sinan Ülgen, a former Turkish diplomat and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Europe thinktank.The White House denied there had been a policy shift, and Trump went on Twitter on Monday to denounce the New York Times for its reporting of Bolton’s comments.“No different from my original statements, we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!..” Trump tweeted. Bolton retweeted the president, adding “My thoughts exactly.Pompeo said in an interview published on Monday: “We need to have long conversations with the Turks about what this will look like after withdrawal.”The secretary of state said that the US would maintain its relationship with the Syrian Kurds. “We will find a relationship with them that accommodates all of our interests,” he told Bloomberg News.Pompeo is due to embark on a tour of eight Arab capitals, with the aim of steadying alliances in the wake of Trump’s surprises announcement and the subsequent resignation of US defence secretary James Mattis.Trump tweeted on 19 December: “We have defeated Isis in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump presidency.”During his heated phone call with Erdoğan five days earlier, he is reported to have declared: “OK, it’s all yours. We are done.”By Sunday, however, he appeared to agree with Bolton that the withdrawal would be conditional. “We are pulling back in Syria. We’re going to be removing our troops,” he told reporters. But he added: “We won’t be finally pulled out until Isis is gone.”Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Centre for a New American Security, said: “I think there is an intramural battle going on within the administration by the designated Syria policy team, trying to repair damage done by the president’s announcement.”He added: “Trump came off a bad month in December and thought that the Syria announcement would be a quick win for his base.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91456528d0c8d88a989b5557d98f22746c87d4bc/53_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d42b816ce522441f07557005678e0773","title":"netanyahu demands live tv showdown with his accusers","story":"‘I have nothing to lose’, says Israeli prime minister implicated in three corruption cases as elections loomIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has used a nationally broadcast address to demand that he be allowed to confront live on television the states’ witnesses who have implicated him in three corruption cases.In a bizarre performance worthy of Donald Trump, Netanyahu suggested that the best resolution to his legal issues, which have cast a shadow over his hopes of re-election, should be a reality TV moment where he faces his accusers.“What are they afraid of? I’m not afraid. I have nothing to lose,” Netanyahu said, adding: “I’m willing for it to be livestreamed for the public to hear the full truth. I’m confident in my truth.” He described the investigation against him as “biased”.The speech, which had been billed as a “dramatic announcement”, was the latest effort by Netanyahu to push back against the investigation and the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit. It has been widely reported that Mandelblit is considering indicting Netanyahu before the elections on 9 April.Netanyahu also used his national podium to accuse police investigators of ignoring other witnesses he claims could have testified in his favour.The live statement from the prime minister’s residence caught even seasoned Netanyahu-watchers in Israel by surprise, coming just weeks after he called elections.Israeli fraud investigators have recommended charges against Netanyahu in three long-running investigations: Case 1000, involving gifts from wealthy businessmen allegedly in exchange for favours Case 2000, in which he is accused of colluding with a media organisation in exchange for favourable coverage and Case 4000, involving a major Israeli telecoms company.While Netanyahu has vociferously denied any wrongdoing – insisting he will continue to serve as prime minister and run for re-election – any indictments announced so close would inevitably prompt calls for him to step aside.Netanyahu’s televised speech was immediately condemned by the Labor party leader, Avi Gabai. “In a normal country, a prime minister does not behave this way. In a normal country, the prime minister does not attack the law enforcement authorities,” Gabai said.The leader of the opposition, Shelly Yachimovich, described the speech as “a cynical and pathetic elections speech of someone who is trying with all his might to escape the law”.During a visit to Brazil last week to meet the country’s new far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, Netanyahu insisted that he would not need to resign even if he was indicted.Netanyahu said: “Israel is a country ruled by law and according to the law,” adding that “a prime minister doesn’t have to resign” because of “a hearing process”.Commenting on the prospect of an imminent indictment, he said: “If that happens, I won’t resign. Imagine what happens if you oust a prime minister before the end of the hearing process, and at the end of the hearing it is decided to close the case. That would be absurd and a terrible blow to democracy.“In a democracy, leaders are chosen through a vote, not through a partially completed legal process.”Monday’s televised address follows a recent poll in the Jerusalem Post that suggested that a slim majority of voters believed Netanyahu should resign if he was indicted pending a hearing before the election.Only a third of voters polled said they believed he should not resign. However, other recent poll for the Maariv daily suggested that Netanyahu’s Likud party would win the same number of seats even if he were indicted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77f2a7b71ea97b7819126c52573c729d81f657c3/0_118_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b44ec1a32e83c41c27a4174391e8a65f","title":"the mormon polygamists who believe missouri is the promised land","story":"The Ranch is a mystery to those in neighboring towns, but is considered Zion to the about 400 polygamists who live thereAfter church, Flint Laub, his two wives and their 10 children sat down at the kitchen table to eat pizza.The lunch was served in the big house, where Michelle Laub, 32, and her seven children live. Flint’s second wife is Ruth Anne Laub, who is 25 and Michelle’s half-sister. She recently gave birth to her third child. Ruth Anne Laub and her kids live in a second house a few steps away from the big one.The Laubs live in a polygamous community of perhaps 400 people in rural Missouri between the towns of Humansville and Stockton. The residents call it “the Ranch”, though the agriculture is limited to a hay field and a few cows and chickens. People in the neighboring towns refer to the community as “the Compound”, but you won’t see any high walls or armed guards — just brown dirt roads winding through clusters of trees and homes.Inside the big house, the adults laughed about what outsiders think of them. Flint, 40, runs a roofing company. If someone asks him if he’s a polygamist, he will say yes. Sometimes people will ask if the Compound is really prepped for warfare, assuming they are survivalists (they’re not). Ruth Anne, who has worked as a first responder in Stockton, says one day someone asked her if she believed in air conditioning. Yes, she said. Her house is modern constructed from concrete poured into plastic foam.“It probably bothers me that people think that’s who we are,” Ruth Anne said, “but it’s funny, too.”“If I was raised outside the religion,” Flint said, “and heard about people with multiple wives, I would think that’s pretty crazy, too.”“I believe Missouri is the promised land,” said Sean Anderson, a 51-year-old fundamentalist Mormon from Mexico who has also lived in Arizona and Utah. He recently moved to The Ranch with his wife and their six children.The residents are a hodgepodge of people whose members in Utah haven’t always gotten along. But here, the polygamists worship not only with each other, but also with the Mormon church, also known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which officially abandoned polygamy in 1890 and excommunicates members found practicing it.Despite their differences, the mainstream Latter-day Saints and people on The Ranch still share core beliefs, and the community still uses its texts. This week, Seth Laub, an elder in the congregation, gave a lesson from the Book of Mormon. “Nothing is hopeless in God’s eyes,” Seth told worshippers.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was founded in 1830 by a then-24-year-old Vermont-born Joseph Smith. To this day, anyone considering themselves to be a Latter-day Saint still reveres Smith. Fundamentalist Mormons, the ones who are not part of the mainstream church, and often practice polygamy, believe in following his original teachings, including a revelation Smith said he received three times between 1834 and 1842: Smith told associates that an angel appeared to him and told him to practice plural marriage. Historians believe Smith married his first plural wife in Kirtland, Ohio, in the mid-1830s. Smith died in 1844.Today, some fundamentalist Mormon polygamists believe plural marriage is necessary to reach the highest level of heaven. Others practice polygamy simply to follow Smith’s teachings. These polygamists tend to believe in big families: women often give birth to 10 or more children. While some of the polygamist leaders have been known to have 20 or more wives, most men have two or three.The idea of The Ranch emerged on 7 November 1983, when Stephen Laub was at his home in Motoqua, an enclave in south-west Utah for members of a polygamous church called the Apostolic United Brethren, or AUB.He was in the cellar, stocking and preparing it to ride out an apocalypse at the end of the millennium, when he heard someone call his name.He went to his wives to ask what they wanted. They said they didn’t call him and didn’t hear a voice.He heard the voice over eight days. Eventually, he tracked the voice to a nearby mountain. He started hiking. The voice had more instructions as he hiked farther up the mountain.As he recorded in his journal: “The Lord told me he wants me to go to Missouri and buy a farm.”For Mormons of all stripes, Missouri – specifically Jackson county – is a landmark. Mormons began arriving there in 1831 and that year, Smith had a prophecy that Zion was in Jackson county and that Jesus would return there one day.But Latter-day Saints had conflicts with other Missouri settlers over land, commerce and governance and by 1838, violence got so bad modern textbooks call it the Missouri Mormon wwar. The ugliest episode happened that year, when 17 Latter-day Saints and one sympathizer were massacred at a place called Haun’s Mill. Latter-day Saints soon began leaving the state.When Laub hiked down from the mountain and arrived home, his brother Derril Laub and another resident, Bruce Compton, were there to help him with the cellar. He told them they needed to go to Missouri. Because Latter-day Saints believe their movement started with a revelation from God, no one challenged him.They did ask where in Missouri they were supposed to go. To provide them with an answer, Stephen Laub hiked back up the mountain to seek a clarification. God told him to go about 100 miles south of Independence.The next day, the Laub brothers, some of their sons, Compton and another resident named Kent Andra loaded into a blue pickup truck and began driving east.“The idea was to build the kingdom of God, establish Zion,” Compton, now 76, said in a recent interview.The men stopped in St George, Utah to make a phone call. It was to the president of their church, Owen Allred, in Salt Lake City. Stephen conveyed his plan.Allred didn’t like it. After being driven from Missouri, the early leaders of the Latter-day Saints issued prophecies saying God’s wrath would be visited upon western Missouri. While some Mormons believe the burned towns and bloodshed western Missouri suffered during the American Civil War fulfilled the prophecy and wiped the slate clean, Allred was among those who thought Missouri still had it coming.He told Stephen to go look at Missouri, but not to buy anything.The truck stopped in Fort Scott, Kansas, just across the state line from Missouri. The men went into a real estate office, where one of the men saw a pamphlet advertising 600 acres between the Missouri towns of Stockton and Humansville.It was a wooded, undeveloped property on one of the Ozark mountains’ massive plateaus. The men drove to the 600 acres to inspect it. They had found their place.The men negotiated a purchase price of $300 an acre and paid $3,000 earnest money. They promised to make a down payment of $34,000 within 30 days. That was money the men didn’t have when they made the agreement. Other believers back in Utah chipped in, and the financing of the property has become part of its mythology — proof that God wanted the believers to be in southwest Missouri.The group contributions were also the first example of ranch residents practicing what’s called a United Order, a fundamentalist Mormon form of communal living where followers give money, entire pieces of property or time and talents to benefit the community.At a coffee shop in Stockton, Missouri, on a blustery November day, Anderson explained what he liked about living out at the Ranch.He’s a two-hour drive from Jackson county for the day Christ returns he also likes that he can have discussions of Mormon doctrine with other residents without fear of offending someone. “They may not agree with me,” Anderson said, “and they aren’t going to ostracize me.”That makes the Ranch a unique spot. Even though Mormon polygamists all trace their beliefs to the same place, they have had disagreements. The groups have tended to isolate themselves within specific neighborhoods in metropolitan Salt Lake City or locations in the Utah or Arizona deserts.While most of the disputes have been peaceful, the most infamous episodes happened in the 1970s when a polygamist named Ervil LeBaron ordered the murders of rival polygamous leaders and others who he thought offended God. One of the victims in 1977 was Rulon Allred, who founded the AUB. He was shot to death in his chiropractic clinic in Salt Lake City.Today some of LeBaron and Allred’s relations live among the polygamists near Humansville. The Ranch has residents who hail from at least three distinct polygamous sects, plus what are known as independents. Those are people with fundamentalist Mormon beliefs who do not affiliate with a church.Anderson would qualify as one of those. He was born in Mexico to a Mexican mother and American father. Anderson developed a belief in fundamental Mormonism. He had two wives for a time, but those marriages dissolved.He and his current wife, Clara Anderson, moved to the Ranch in the fall with their six children. Clara, 39, is one of Rulon Allred’s great-granddaughters.Within their household, the Andersons admit the roles are traditional. Sean works in construction and is a part owner of a barbecue restaurant while his wife stays home.“I stay home with my kids because I want to stay home with my kids,” she said. “It’s not because Sean told me to stay home.”Women from the Ranch are weary of the public perception of wives in polygamy as trapped inside a home. Some women hold jobs in the surrounding communities and some don’t.A review of marriage licenses in south-west Missouri shows most residents of the polygamous community marry in their 20s, though a few brides and grooms have been as young as 17. In Mormon polygamy, the husband usually has one legal wife subsequent marriages are ordained in a religious service, but there’s no license on file with any county clerk.In Missouri, you can be convicted of bigamy if a married person “purports”, to quote the statute, to marry another person. The offense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. That’s a lesser punishment than, say, Utah, where polygamy is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison or 15 years if it’s committed in conjunction with a fraud or violent offense.Cedar county prosecutor Ty Gaither, one of the locals who refer to the polygamous community as The Compound, said he has not received any complaints about crimes there. He points out his county is home to multiple religious communities, including Amish and Mennonite.“Let’s put it this way,” Gaither said of a plural marriage, “if I had three parties who were consenting adults, I wouldn’t have a complaining witness. If I had a complaining witness, we would take a look.”As they finished lunch, Flint, Michelle and Ruth Anne Laub talked more about some of the perceptions people have of their family.Over the years, some have asked if the community has a relationship to Warren Jeffs, the president of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who is serving a sentence of life plus 20 years in prison for crimes related to sexually abusing two girls he married as plural wives. (The answer is no there are no known Jeffs followers at the Ranch.)The spouses also discussed the changes they have seen in the community. The AUB leaders in Utah were never pleased with those who moved to Missouri and as a result, the two communities have had little relationship in the last 35 years.People have come and gone over the years. Compton, one of those Motoqua men who drove to Missouri in the blue pickup truck, didn’t find everything he was looking for on those 600 acres that was supposed to be Zion.Compton says living in a plural marriage and a united order gave him a lot of questions and not enough answers about God. Before he moved to Missouri, Compton came across a book about Jewish Kabbalah during a work trip to California.Kabbalah is meant to explain the relationship between God and the universe. Compton developed an interest in metaphysics. The other Motoqua men didn’t like it. They believed metaphysics conflicted with their fundamentalist Mormon beliefs. They eventually asked Compton to leave.Compton separated from his plural wives, remarried to just one woman, and now leads a church in nearby Buffalo, Missouri, where he preaches a belief in an almighty creator. He’ll teach from the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Torah, the Qur’an or any other text promoting monotheism.“I search for truth,” Compton said.You can also buy a psychic reading from Compton and his wife, Connie Compton. The client will share certain information that Bruce relays to Connie. Through a trance, she will give advice or tell the client the cause of any physical or emotional ailments.As for what’s next at what people call either the Compound or the Ranch, the residents years ago poured a concrete foundation for a temple against a small slope near the center of the community.No one seems to know when the rest of the temple will be constructed, or whether it will take the impetus of the residents or direction from God.• This piece was co-published with the Salt Lake Tribune."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3739267.1545409801!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"crappy new year 16 ways to survive skint january","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHundreds of millions of coppers worth tens of millions of euro, that have simply disappeared in Irish homes.

Photograph: Harry McGeeIt is a ghost village, with four rows of concrete houses stretching along a long empty street. The population all left some years ago for some reasons unknown.Now, under an unforgiving sun, it is being overtaken with brushweed and snakes.This is Koulikoro, in the southern part of Mali, a country that has been beset by sporadic violence and Islamist extremism over the past decade. There is ongoing conflict in the north. Here it is more settled but the threat remains real, if not imminent.A large contingent of Mali soldiers appear out of nowhere, moving in formation through the empty buildings, essentially “casing the joint” for any hostile forces or improvised booby traps. It is an impressive exercise.And that is what it is, it is a training exercise. It forms part of urban terrain training for the armed forces of the country. Here, as in most other countries, increasing urbanisation has meant the theatre of conflict is now densely populated cities rather than open terrain.The training is provided by the Irish Defence Forces, as part of its mandate with the European Union’s Training Mission in Mali, involving 620 personnel from 28 countries.There are 20 Irish soldiers here, working in training and specialist roles. The trainer for this urban terrain course is Sgt John Pearse, a relation of 1916 leader Patrick Pearse. Later another highly experienced NCO, Sgt John Maloney, conducts an equally illustrative exercise with Malian soldiers to identify potential improvised explosive devices (IEDs). As in many recent conflicts, the use of IEDs in Mali has increased significantly.In an outdoor classroom, sheltered from the sun, Lieut Catherine Smyth, Scottish-born and on her first mission, teaches humanitarian law in French to officers of the Mali army.Witnessing all of this is Leo Varadkar, on his first visit to Africa as Taoiseach. He is clearly impressed by what he sees at Koulikoro, a large training camp about 1½ hours north from the capital Bamako. Here the Irish personnel form an integral part of an EU programme to support the local defence forces to maintain peace and stability. “It is great to see the level of sophistication and training that our Defence Forces have that we are able to impart to Malian defence forces,” said the Taoiseach.The chief of staff of the Defence Forces, Vice-Admiral Mark Mellett, who is accompanying Mr Varadkar, emphasised the importance of such missions for Ireland.Mr Varadkar also placed such missions on a wider dimension.“So many of the problems we face at home have an international dimension, housing, climate change, security threats.“We need to be part of the world and engage with the world,” he said.“We have been here in Mali as part of the EU training mission for five years now. Given the impact the region has on the rest of the world in terms of migration and being a sources of terrorism in some cases, in terms of climate change, there will be an Irish presence in Africa for quite a period to come.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3750526.1546897788!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"backstop assurances unlikely to tilt odds in favour of may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May remains convinced that the DUP’s 10 MPs are the key to unlocking the support of Conservative Brexiteers for her deal. Photograph: Andy RainEPAThe Taoiseach’s confirmation that Britain can expect further written assurances on the Northern Ireland backstop will be welcome in Downing Street, as Theresa May’s Brexit deal faces almost certain defeat in the House of Commons next week. The prime minister, who hosted some Conservative MPs for drinks at No 10 on Monday evening, has promised domestic reassurances alongside those from Brussels.Mrs May remains convinced that the Democratic Unionist Party’s 10 MPs are the key to unlocking the support of Conservative Brexiteers for her deal. But the DUP demands legally-binding changes to the border backstop that would make it time-limited or give Britain a unilateral exit mechanism. The party also wants the Northern Ireland Assembly to have a veto over any further regulatory alignment with the European Union after Brexit.None of these demands is acceptable to the EU, which is adamant that the text of the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened and that clarifications on the backstop cannot contradict its definition in the agreement. The EU is also queasy about the prospect of what one senior official described as “a conveyer belt of concessions” without a cast-iron guarantee that they would win a majority for the deal in parliament.The expectation at Westminster is that, if the deal is rejected next week, Mrs May will return to Brussels to seek further concessions as the March 29th deadline draws closer. One option is to craft an amendment that outlines the concessions needed from the EU and to win a majority for that before going back to Brussels.The prime minister’s room for manoeuvre has increased, partly because after last month’s confidence vote her leadership cannot be challenged until next December. The case for her Brexit deal grows stronger as other options such as Canada-plus and Norway-plus fall away because of lack of time and support.MPs will seek on Tuesday to demonstrate that a majority opposes a no-deal Brexit, which is now the favoured option for hardline Brexiteers. Brexiteers who want no deal and the Remainers who want a second referendum both believe they can achieve their goal by remaining implacable in opposition to the prime minister’s deal.In this atmosphere, written assurances on the backstop are unlikely to be robust enough to persuade many of May’s critics in her own party to change their minds about the deal. But as the cliff edge approaches, the prime minister’s argument that her deal delivers Brexit with minimum disruption could become more persuasive."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

such as sleep, exercise and face-to-face socialising.And its experts urged parents to “practise what they preach” - and spend less time of their leisure time glued to tablets and phones.The guidance comes alongside a systematic review of the scientific evidence regarding the health impact of screen time, published on Friday in BMJ Open.It found moderately strong evidence for a link between greater screen time and depressive symptoms.Researchers said it appeared that the “displacement of positive activities” - in particular, lost sleep, as a result of time spent scrolling - was the most convincing explanation for the link.And they said the impact of blue light on screens on the ability to sleep was likely to be a factor.Dr Max Davie, from the RCPCH, said stopping access to all screens for at least an hour before sleep was a  “sensible rule of thumb”.“The process of going to sleep is a physiological process involving the secretion of melatonin and screens appear to interfere with that,” he said.Researchers said the review also found links between high levels of screen time and excess weight - perhaps because children were likely to consume more snacks while staring at a screen.The college also urged parents to negotiate “age appropriate” boundaries on screen time with children, with firm consequences if such limits were breached.Dr Davie said families needed to ensure that screen time was “under control” - for adults as well as children.“Children do learn from example rather than instruction. It\u0027s difficult to impose strict limits on your children\u0027s screen use if you are constantly on screens yourself. It\u0027s much better to be authoritative about screens if you practise what you preach,” he said.“We suggest that age appropriate boundaries are established, negotiated by parent and child that everyone in the family understands. When these boundaries are not respected, actions need to be put in place with parents making consequences clear.”Four ways to keep your child safe onlineProf Russell Viner, the college’s president, said: “If you are authoritative - tough love and giving clear boundaries and warmth, that works.”The chief medical officer is currently considering setting new recommendations on screen time for children. But the college shied away from recommending a daily screen time limit for all children, saying more research was needed, particularly on the use of social media.So far, many studies on screen time have focussed on television habits, failing to keep up pace with the advent of websites and smart phones.Next week the head of the NHS is expected to unveil plans to expand children\u0027s mental health services to deal with the fallout from an explosion of social media.Simon Stevens has said the NHS has been left “picking up the pieces” of an epidemic of mental illness fuelled by digital overload.It comes after The  launched a duty of care campaign calling for more stringent regulation of sites like Facebook and Instagram, in order to protect children from harm.The expansion of mental health services for children - and the rollout of a four week target for treatment - are expected to form part of a 10-year plan for the NHS.Brexit: the Uncivil War, review: Dominic Cummings becomes

scientists condemn irrational claims hindu epics contain","story":"Prime Minister Modi suggested that the Hindu god Ganesh showed ancient Indians were capable of plastic surgeryTop scientists in India on Monday condemned “irrational” claims made at the 106th annual meeting of the prestigious Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA).The Breakthrough Science Society (BSS), an NGO that campaigns for scientific literacy, held protest meetings across the country against presentations suggesting that ancient Hindu epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata contain detailed knowledge of stem cell research, test tube babies, aircraft and guided missiles.People must ask the organisers how they allow this, said Rajani KS of BSS.Professor Nageswara Rao, vice chancellor of Andhra University, told the ISCA\u0027s special Children’s Science Congress that according to the Mahabharata, a single mother gave birth to 100 sons via test tube technology.“The Mahabharata says 100 eggs were fertilised and put into 100 earthen pots” Prof Rao said.He put it to an audience of teenagers that these were early test tube babies, claiming this proved stem cell research was prevalent in India thousands of years ago.Prof Rao also claimed that the Hindu god Ram used guided missiles that would chase targets, strike them and then return.The demon god Ravana, the professor further stated, operated 24 different types of aircraft from several airports in his kingdom.   Another participant, scientist Kannan Krishnan from Tamil Nadu in southern India, challenged Einstein’s theory of relativity and Isaac Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation on the grounds that neither of the two scientists understood physics.Mr Krishnan declared that the Theory of Gravitational Waves would soon be re-named “Modi Waves’, after the Indian prime Minister Narendra Modi.ISCA organisers later distanced themselves from these two speakers and resolved to exercise more caution in inviting participants next year.“We are shocked at the comments made by the two speakers,” ISCA general secretary P P Mathur said.This is not the first time absurd claims have been made at ISCA meets, with critics alleging the Modi government has debased the organisation.In 2015 a paper on Indian aviation technology claimed that the ancient native sage Bhardwaja had detailed blueprints for varied types of aircraft.The year before prime minister Modi buttressed similar logic when he told an audience of doctors and scientists in Mumbai that plastic surgery and genetic science had flourished in ancient India.He said that was how the revered Hindu god Ganesha’s elephant head was attached to a human body, and how the warrior god Karna was born outside his mother’s womb.In a similar vein other members of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, in a bid to laud India’s achievements, have claimed that motorcars, space vehicles even the internet existed in ancient times.Please review our commenting

sally rooney claims victory","story":"Sally Rooney won the prize for her coming-of-age tale, Normal PeopleSally Rooney has become the youngest author to win the Costa Novel Award, four months after she was omitted from the Booker Prize shortlist.  The 27-year-old won the prize for her coming-of-age tale, Normal People, described by the Costa judges as a trailblazing novel about modern life and love that will electrify any reader.The Irish novelist was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize last year and tipped to win. But Normal People did not make the shortlist in what many saw as a snub for a novel that was both critically acclaimed and a commercial hit.Her Costa win is the latest milestone in a career that began with her first novel, Conversations With Friends, written while she studied for an MA at Trinity College Dublin. It was snapped up by a publisher in a seven-way auction.She has variously been hailed as the first great millennial author and Salinger for the Snapchat generation, and Normal People is now being adapted for BBC Three with the Oscar-winning Lenny Abrahamson as director.It is the story of an on-off romance between Marianne and Connell, who grow up in the same small town in rural Ireland and begin a tentative relationship that continues through the years.The Costa Book Awards are ided into several categories, and the overall winner will be announced on January 29.Stuart Turton won the First Novel Award for his debut, The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, a crime novel. Bart van Es, a professor of English Literature at Oxford University, won the Biography Award for The Cut Out Girl, set during the Second World War. It tells the story of an eight-year-old Jewish girl taken in by his grandparents, who were members of the Dutch resistance, and examines a dark period in the history of the Netherlands.The Poetry Award went to JO Morgan for Assurance, a war poem inspired by his RAF officer father’s work in maintaining Britain’s Airborne Nuclear Deterrent, which was chosen as a  poetry book of the year.

Credit card debt was at £72.5bn, or £2,688 per household.“The government is skating on thin ice by relying on household debt to drive growth,” Ms O’Grady said. “A strong economy needs people spending wages, not credit cards and loans.Credit card debt hits £72.5bn despite fears for UK economy’s future“Our economy is not working for workers. They need stronger rights and bargaining powers. Trade unions should be allowed the freedom to enter every workplace to negotiate higher wages.”Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,\u0026nbspsaid student loan debt is a “different animal” from credit card debt, for example, because borrowers don’t pay money back unless they are earning over £21,000.\u0026nbsp“This prevents the most extreme outcomes,” he said.“In aggregate, consumer debt as a whole is below the level it was in 2008, although that is hardly a comfort and means there is still vulnerability.”Mr Kara also pointed to concerns around the\u0026nbsplow level of saving by households. “If there is some kind of trigger or\u0026nbspflare-up – most obviously a rise in interest rates or unemployment – that could have a negative effect on the economy.”A sharp rise in interest rates could have a “material impact” on economic growth which, at 1.4 per cent, is already comparatively low, Mr Kara said.On the positive side, he said\u0026nbspthe Bank of England’s stress tests demonstrate that lenders are in a better financial position than they were before the financial crisis, with more capital to act as a buffer in the event of a shock.However, the central bank has much less room to manoeuvre than it did in 2008. Faced with a\u0026nbspdownturn the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would typically lower interest rates, making debt cheaper and fuelling a recovery. But rates are already close to all-time lows.On the other hand, if inflation were to rise the bank would typically raise interest rates to cool demand and rein in price increases.Perhaps the most likely trigger for rising inflation in the near future is a potential fall in the value of the pound in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspWhile governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney has warned that rate rises could occur if the UK crashes out of the EU, the MPC would likely be reluctant to raise its benchmark too far or too fast for fear of damaging an already fragile economy at a time of upheaval.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Yet neither has indicated its stance has changed since a 1 December agreement by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to postpone further increases.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Foreign Ministry said Chinese military aircraft and naval vessels were dispatched to identify the US\u0026nbspvessel and warn it to leave the area near disputed islands in the South China Sea.\u0026nbsp“We have made stern complaints with the US,” Mr Lu said. He said the warship, which he said was the destroyer the USS McCampbell, had violated Chinese and international law, infringed on Chinese sovereignty and undermined peace and stability.\u0026nbspWhy Trump’s trade war with China is a danger to world prosperity“As for whether this move has any impact to the ongoing China-US\u0026nbsptrade consultations... to properly resolve existing issues of all kinds between China and the US\u0026nbspis good for the two countries and the world,” Mr Lu said\u0026nbspHe added, “The two sides both have responsibility to create necessary and good atmosphere to this end.”\u0026nbspThere was no immediate comment from the US\u0026nbspside about the Chinese complaint.\u0026nbspThe American side in the trade talks was being led by a deputy US\u0026nbsptrade representative, Jeffrey Gerrish, according to the US\u0026nbspgovernment. The delegation includes agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials.\u0026nbspThe Chinese government gave no details of who would represent Beijing.\u0026nbspThe talks went ahead despite tensions over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on US\u0026nbspcharges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran.\u0026nbspECB warns of trade war threat to eurozoneUS and China agree to pause trade war, after G20 dinner Trump and Xi to sit down for dinner as US-China trade war ragesTrump and China\u0027s Xi Jinping agree to \u0027strengthen economic exchanges\u0027Millions of jobs at risk from continued global trade war, WTO warnsMr Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 per cent on $250bn of Chinese imports over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Beijing responded by imposing penalties on $110bn of American goods, slowing customs clearance for US\u0026nbspcompanies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses.\u0026nbspWashington, Europe and other trading partners complain Beijing\u0027s tactics violate its market-opening obligations.\u0026nbspThe standoff also reflects American anxiety about China\u0027s rise as a potential competitor in telecommunications and other technology. Mr Trump wants Beijing to roll back initiatives like “Made in China 2025,” which calls for the state-led creation of global competitors in such fields as robotics and artificial intelligence. American officials worry those might erode US\u0026nbspindustrial leadership.\u0026nbspThe ruling Communist Party is reluctant to give up initiatives it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.\u0026nbspChina\u0027s leaders have tried to defuse complaints by emphasising its potential as an export market and by promising to increase foreign access to their auto, finance and other industries as well as the technology initiatives.\u0026nbspEconomists say the 90-day postponement of additional tariff increases that had been meant to take effect 1 January\u0026nbspmay be too short to settle the disputes bedevilling US-Chinese relations.\u0026nbspBeijing\u0027s goal may be to show enough progress to persuade Trump to extend his deadline, they say.\u0026nbspCooling economic growth in both countries is turning up the pressure to reach a settlement.\u0026nbspChinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 per cent in the quarter ending in September. Auto sales tumbled 16 percent in November over a year earlier. Weak real estate sales are forcing developers to cut prices.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspeconomy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, and unemployment is at a five-decade low. But surveys show consumer confidence is weakening because of concern that growth will slow this year.Beijing has tried in vain to recruit France, Germany, South Korea and other governments as allies against Trump. They criticise his tactics but echo US\u0026nbspcomplaints about Chinese industrial policy and market barriers.\u0026nbspThe European Union filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organisation in June against Chinese rules that the 28-nation trade bloc said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their own technology.\u0026nbspFor their part, Chinese officials are unhappy with US\u0026nbspcurbs on exports of “dual use” technology with possible military applications. They complain China\u0027s companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.\u0026nbspSome manufacturers that serve the United States have shifted production to other countries to avoid Trump\u0027s tariffs.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He also said the company expected revenue records in a range of markets, including the US, Germany and Italy and other parts of east Asia.Despite those successes, the difficulties would encourage Apple to make changes in the future, he wrote.External forces may push us around a bit, but we are not going to use them as an excuse, he wrote.\u0026nbspNor will we just wait around until they get better.This moment gives us an opportunity to learn and to take action, to focus on our strengths and on Apple’s mission — delivering the best products on earth for our customers and providing them with an unmatched level of service.

The three are arranged in a strange line-up: the lenses are in a triangle, and the flash is laying off to the side.As well as the unusual arrangement of the lenses, even the large bump is likely to prove controversial among Apple users who have complained about the fact that modern iPhones\u0026nbsphave small hills sticking out of their back.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe use of three lenses has long been rumoured as a potential future product for the iPhone, but it is unlikely that anyone expected them to be arranged in this way.

The scientists looked at mice, voles, songbirds, frogs and cichlid fishes.They found that in the male brains of these species, there was a common set of 24 genes being expressed that were tied with monogamy.In practice, monogamous behaviour can be highly complex, but the results suggested that at its heart there is a simple mechanism in the brain that triggers it.What intrigued the scientists was the way in which the same “toolkit” was appearing repeatedly across the tree of life. The animals they focused on would not have shared a common ancestor for 450 million years.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.118 Baby mice tears could be used in pest controlA study from the University of Tokyo has found that the tears of baby mice cause female mice to be less interested in the sexual advances of males218 Final warning to limit climate catastropheThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued a report which projects the impact of a rise in global temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius and warns against a higher increase318 Nobel prize for evolution chemistsThe nobel prize for chemistry has been awarded to three chemists working with evolution.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.“There are conserved sets of genes that are used for particular things,” Dr Rebecca Young of the University of Texas told The Independent.She said this is seen not only in the mechanisms controlling physical processes like limb growth, but also the underpinnings of behaviours like bird song and even aggression.“Much of our behaviour or animals’ behaviour is subject to evolutionary processes … that is written down in our genome and manifests itself in particular gene expression patterns in the brain or elsewhere in the body,” said Dr Hans Hofmann.In certain situations, pressures like predators or a lack of resources make it sensible to share the load with a long-term partner, and this is when animals evolve towards monogamy.As for humans, a species that commonly forms lasting pair bonds, Dr Hofmann said it was possible that similar genetic processes may lie at the root of this monogamy.In theory, he said it might be possible to compare our species to closely related, non-monogamous apes like chimpanzees.“If we could do that then we might expect gene expression variation that is somewhat similar to what we find in these other monogamousnon-monogamous species pairs,” he said.“But it’s important to understand there are many factors playing into it.”The\u0026nbspresults were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

Ms May, speaking at the CBI conference, said it was “important” that the UK had escaped EU rules by the 2022 election, but did not give a guarantee“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break,” said Prof Bale.\u0026nbspThe study found that 59 per cent of Tory members opposed Ms May’s deal, compared to 38 per cent who supported it and 3 per cent who did not have an opinion.More than half, 53 per cent, also said that the deal “does not respect the result of the referendum”, comparing to 42 per cent who said that it does.People were then asked how they would vote in a referendum where there were three options – to remain, leave with the deal or leave without one – and in which they are able to put down a first and second preference.Some 57 per cent opted to leave with no deal as their first choice, with only 23 per cent putting Ms May’s deal and 15 per cent backing the option to remain in the EU.Forty per cent\u0026nbspthen put the prime minister’s proposals as their second choice, with 19 per cent putting no deal and 6\u0026nbspper cent opting to stay as a member of the bloc.The survey showed large majorities of members think both that a no-deal Brexit will have a positive impact on the economy in the medium to long term and that warnings of disruption have been exaggerated.A slim majority, 51 per cent, said they thought Ms May was doing “well”, but almost as many, 48 per cent said she was doing “badly” to some degree.But despite wavering support for Ms May and her deal, an overwhelming majority of members – 83 per cent – opposed the idea of having an election, while 82 per cent would not back a further referendum.Yesterday, the prime minister’s Northern Irish partners in government raised the stakes further in the Brexit talks, saying there is “no need” for key parts of the deal she agreed with the EU.Nigel Dodds, DUP deputy leader,\u0026nbspargued that the withdrawal agreement she is seeking “flies in the face” of the government’s own commitments relating to the border between the north and the republic.His comments came after a meeting in Downing Street, and are a blow to the prime minister as she desperately tries to convince the Northern Irish party and her own MPs to back her proposals ahead of a vote in the coming weeks.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The EU says that for a country to participate in the single market, and reap economic rewards from having goods and services flow freely across borders, it must accept the free movement of people.So if we want to control immigration to a significant degree, to the extent that we set\u0026nbspour\u0026nbspown policy in full, it does mean leaving the single market.And\u0026nbspif we want to maintain an open border\u0026nbspbetween\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland and the Republic, the EU have consistently argued that Northern Ireland at least must remain part of the customs union – otherwise goods that have not been subjected to the common tariff could make their way into EU territory across the Irish border.These are just two issues emanating from the single market and customs union questions, but there are many more. To pick one – the closer a country is to both affects what kind of trade deals, if any, it can make with the rest of the world. \u0026nbspIt is for all these reasons that both of the major British political parties have opted for middle-of-the-road Brexit policies, that seek to compromise between keeping as much of the economic benefit of these two systems as possible, whilst also seeking to satisfy the 2016 referendum result, by doing away with parts of them that have fed displeasure over EU membership.Both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have said they will leave the single market and customs union, allowing them to end immigration that is governed by the EU’s free movement principle, which so riled many of their voters.Corbyn calls for public ownership of railways amid train fare hikeBut whereas Jeremy Corbyn has backed a new customs union with the EU, Ms May has said she wants the UK to have no part in a customs union with Europe, which would allow greater leeway to sign trade deals with other countries.Mr Corbyn has said he wants a deal that delivers the “exact same benefits” of the single market, albeit with greater leeway for the British government to intervene in domestic industry, something restricted by the EU’s state aid rules.Ms May meanwhile has said that after the transition period, she wants a trade deal with the EU that would leave the UK outside of the single market, but with as frictionless trade\u0026nbspas possible. In the meantime, Britain would effectively adhere to customs union rules and single market rules during a transition which could last to December 2020 and beyond.Whatever the outcome, the state of the UK economy, the lot of the British people and the government’s freedom to act after Brexit is likely to be directly related to the country’s links to these two critical supranational structures.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Credit card debt was at £72.5bn, or £2,688 per household.“The government is skating on thin ice by relying on household debt to drive growth,” Ms O’Grady said. “A strong economy needs people spending wages, not credit cards and loans.Credit card debt hits £72.5bn despite fears for UK economy’s future“Our economy is not working for workers. They need stronger rights and bargaining powers. Trade unions should be allowed the freedom to enter every workplace to negotiate higher wages.”Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,\u0026nbspsaid student loan debt is a “different animal” from credit card debt, for example, because borrowers don’t pay money back unless they are earning over £21,000.\u0026nbsp“This prevents the most extreme outcomes,” he said.“In aggregate, consumer debt as a whole is below the level it was in 2008, although that is hardly a comfort and means there is still vulnerability.”Mr Kara also pointed to concerns around the\u0026nbsplow level of saving by households. “If there is some kind of trigger or\u0026nbspflare-up – most obviously a rise in interest rates or unemployment – that could have a negative effect on the economy.”A sharp rise in interest rates could have a “material impact” on economic growth which, at 1.4 per cent, is already comparatively low, Mr Kara said.On the positive side, he said\u0026nbspthe Bank of England’s stress tests demonstrate that lenders are in a better financial position than they were before the financial crisis, with more capital to act as a buffer in the event of a shock.However, the central bank has much less room to manoeuvre than it did in 2008. Faced with a\u0026nbspdownturn the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would typically lower interest rates, making debt cheaper and fuelling a recovery. But rates are already close to all-time lows.On the other hand, if inflation were to rise the bank would typically raise interest rates to cool demand and rein in price increases.Perhaps the most likely trigger for rising inflation in the near future is a potential fall in the value of the pound in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspWhile governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney has warned that rate rises could occur if the UK crashes out of the EU, the MPC would likely be reluctant to raise its benchmark too far or too fast for fear of damaging an already fragile economy at a time of upheaval.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He said the warship, which he said was the destroyer the USS McCampbell, had violated Chinese and international law, infringed on Chinese sovereignty and undermined peace and stability.\u0026nbspWhy Trump’s trade war with China is a danger to world prosperity“As for whether this move has any impact to the ongoing China-US\u0026nbsptrade consultations... to properly resolve existing issues of all kinds between China and the US\u0026nbspis good for the two countries and the world,” Mr Lu said\u0026nbspHe added, “The two sides both have responsibility to create necessary and good atmosphere to this end.”\u0026nbspThere was no immediate comment from the US\u0026nbspside about the Chinese complaint.\u0026nbspThe American side in the trade talks was being led by a deputy US\u0026nbsptrade representative, Jeffrey Gerrish, according to the US\u0026nbspgovernment. The delegation includes agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials.\u0026nbspThe Chinese government gave no details of who would represent Beijing.\u0026nbspThe talks went ahead despite tensions over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on US\u0026nbspcharges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran.\u0026nbspECB warns of trade war threat to eurozoneUS and China agree to pause trade war, after G20 dinner Trump and Xi to sit down for dinner as US-China trade war ragesTrump and China\u0027s Xi Jinping agree to \u0027strengthen economic exchanges\u0027Millions of jobs at risk from continued global trade war, WTO warnsMr Trump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 per cent on $250bn of Chinese imports over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.

Mr Trump wants Beijing to roll back initiatives like “Made in China 2025,” which calls for the state-led creation of global competitors in such fields as robotics and artificial intelligence. American officials worry those might erode US\u0026nbspindustrial leadership.\u0026nbspThe ruling Communist Party is reluctant to give up initiatives it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.\u0026nbspChina\u0027s leaders have tried to defuse complaints by emphasising its potential as an export market and by promising to increase foreign access to their auto, finance and other industries as well as the technology initiatives.\u0026nbspEconomists say the 90-day postponement of additional tariff increases that had been meant to take effect 1 January\u0026nbspmay be too short to settle the disputes bedevilling US-Chinese relations.\u0026nbspBeijing\u0027s goal may be to show enough progress to persuade Trump to extend his deadline, they say.\u0026nbspCooling economic growth in both countries is turning up the pressure to reach a settlement.\u0026nbspChinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 per cent in the quarter ending in September. Auto sales tumbled 16 percent in November over a year earlier. Weak real estate sales are forcing developers to cut prices.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspeconomy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, and unemployment is at a five-decade low. But surveys show consumer confidence is weakening because of concern that growth will slow this year.Beijing has tried in vain to recruit France, Germany, South Korea and other governments as allies against Trump. They criticise his tactics but echo US\u0026nbspcomplaints about Chinese industrial policy and market barriers.\u0026nbspThe European Union filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organisation in June against Chinese rules that the 28-nation trade bloc said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their own technology.\u0026nbspFor their part, Chinese officials are unhappy with US\u0026nbspcurbs on exports of “dual use” technology with possible military applications. They complain China\u0027s companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.\u0026nbspSome manufacturers that serve the United States have shifted production to other countries to avoid Trump\u0027s tariffs.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They also sang and danced for reporters, including a rendition in English of “If You’re Happy and You Know it, Clap Your Hands”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

I’m shouting out for help of humanity.”Following a flurry\u0026nbspof attention and demands from rights groups that her deportation be halted, Thailand\u0027s immigration chief\u0026nbspSurachate Hakparn said Ms Qunun\u0026nbspwould be allowed temporary entry to the country for the UN to evaluate her case.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe and UNHCR will talk to her and ask her what her wishes are, whether she wants to request asylum, he\u0026nbsptold a news conference.The United Nations\u0027 refugee agency said it has been in contact with Ms Qunun in order to asses her need for international refugee protection and find an immediate solution for her situation. Images later emerged of her being led from the airport with UN staff.\u0026nbspThe incident comes at a time when Saudi Arabia is under increased scrutiny over its rights record in the wake of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and the use of rendition against activists to silence opposition. Women in Saudi Arabia are forbidden from travelling without the permission of a male . Ms Qunun\u0026nbspwas only able to travel on her own because she had been in Kuwait, which doesn\u0027t have the same law.\u0026nbspMs Qunun said she was fleeing her abusive family, and regularly suffers beatings and death threats from her brothers.“My brothers and family and the Saudi embassy will be waiting for me in Kuwait,” Ms Qunun told Reuters on Sunday. “They will kill me. My life is in danger. My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things.”She added that she had been imprisoned for months inside her house, and suffered\u0026nbspphysical, emotional and verbal abuse.Rights groups had called for Thai authorities to remove the threat of deportation and allow her to apply for asylum.“Thai authorities should immediately halt any deportation, and either allow her to continue her travel to Australia or permit her to remain in Thailand to seek protection as a refugee,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.“Saudi women fleeing their families can face severe violence from relatives, deprivation of liberty, and other serious harm if returned against their will,” he said.Thai immigration authorities said Ms Qunun was refused entry because she did not have the proper documents.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families. In Bangladesh, in 2018, Unicef reached thousands of Rohingya refugee children with mental health and psychosocial support. In Iraq, Unicef is working with partners to provide specialised services to women and children affected by gender-based violence.Democratic Republic of the CongoOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Really I only ask because when the fly-by happened on New Year’s Day, the space craft was traveling at ,mph.This is known in technical circles as “very fast”.And think about it. If you try to take pictures of the underside of a motorway bridge as you pass by, you’re not going to learn much.And you’re only doing .So what nuggets of information came back from the edge of our solar system Ah well. Because the probe only has a -watt transmitter and because it’s four billion miles from earth and because the sun’s currently in the wrong place, we won’t have all the graphs and the algebra for  months.By which time, the boffins will have been given another gazillion dollars to go and look at another bit of frozen rock.I’m not one of those people who say the money should be spent on blankets for refugees.But can we stop pretending that space is a big encyclopaedia of facts we need to know Because it isn’t. The moon taught us nothing of any great consequence.Missions to Mars have given us nothing but a very good film starring Matt Damon and all we know about the bit between is that it’s cold and empty.Yes, further out, beyond the Thermal Shock Region, ten or five thousand galaxies from here, there could be all sorts of juicy titbits for the boffins to analyse.But we can’t get there.And we never will.Becauseyou were on a space ship that took off like the Enterprise, you’d fall over.So let’s concentrate our efforts on something which IS achievable.Turning space travel into the ultimate zero-g theme park ride for tourists.A CHINESE space craft landed on the Moon this week.I anticipate it will learn nothing of any great value but that, within a week, it will have built a factory that makes , pairs of training shoes every month.LIKE many other bores and cowards, I decided on New Year’s Eve to quit drinking for a little while.As I write, it’s lunch time on January  and already, a small rash has developed on my stomach.I looked it up on the internet and, of course, it’s cancer.I was going to have a drink to help me think about that but then I noticed that the pain in my hip is also cancer and so is my failing eyesight and so is my deafness and so is my wonky ankle and so is every symptom anyone has ever developed anywhere.As a research tool, the internet is brilliant. As a doctor, however, it’s scary . . . and almost always wrong.THERE are many noble and well-meaning attempts to make people stop filling the sea with bits of discarded plastic.Iceland, the supermarket chain, has started a “reverse vending machine” scheme which gives you a ten pence voucher for every empty plastic bottle you deposit.And there are many volunteers who comb the world’s coastlines, pulling plastic bags from the mouths of turtles and stranded dolphins.I wish all these people well.But I think a more targeted approach is necessary.Every time I go for a walk on Britain’s coastline, I notice that the high-tide mark is always littered with the plastic wrappers from milk chocolate Bounty bars and Flora margarine tubs.So how’s this for a plan You go to the people who make these things and you give them an ultimatum.Do something about it. Or we will do something to you, involving sharks.AS I watched the fireworks light up the night sky over London on New Year’s Eve, I wondered how long it would take someone to say the money should have been spent on the NHS.The answer, very depressingly, was about four seconds.Well, let me provide a retort.The amount of public money spent on the fireworks was £.million.Which isn’t even enough to buy one decent MRI scanner.Let me put it this way.You could save all your money for a rainy day and live on gruel.But it’s nice once in a while to spend a bit of it on beer and curry.MANY don’t enjoy the first few weeks of the year because it’s usually cold and dark and miserable.I love it though because all my friends are back from their Christmas holidays.Which means my Instagram feed is no longer full of their legs on a beach with nothing in the background but the blue sea and the bloody blue sky.I’M delighted to hear that Olivia Newton John isn’t as poorly as was reported earlier.I’ve always been a fan.Once, in fact, I wrote to Jim’ll Fix It askinghe could fix it for me to sleep with her.The filthy little pervert never even replied.THERE are so many exciting new things set to lt our spirits in .We have what will probably be the last Avengers movie and, a quarter of a century after the original, a new Toy Story.On the small screen, Game Of Thrones will be back and there will be world cups in rugby and cricket.The soundtrack will be provided by the Spice Girls reunion and . . .  none of you will be paying attention to any of it because this month, Theresa May’s useless Brexit deal will be dashed on the foreshore of democratic debate.This will cause Corbyn to propose a vote of no confidence which will trigger a general election.And the winner of that will stage a second referendum which will provide the same result as the first so there will be riots, petrol bombs, power cuts, death and the end of days.Despite this, though, I’d like to wish you all a happy New Year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead he acted as their patsy, issuing childish threats and hyping up the hard-border myth . . . just as the EU wanted.Now his farmers face potential ruin, and he may need a “mega money” rescue.Hate to say it, Leo.

There is nothing cosier than the cocoon of Christmas. And leaving it is a wrench.So a lot of people will be full of dread at the prospect of going back to work.But I actually think that January can be one of the most productive, exciting and dynamic months.And just in case you don’t agree, I’m going to share my tips on how to make January into Fanuary.The first step is to focus on what you want out of this new year. Becauseyou don’t make a plan you will end up exactly where you started, but this time in .If you hate your job, don’t just keep saying that: Work out why you hate it and what steps you need to take to change it. Brush up on your skills. Look for learning opportunities wherever you can — and take them.Be active and invest time in yourself. Dare to dream a bit by applying for jobs you like the look of, evenyou think they are out of your league.Andyou need a helping hand, sign up to my masterclass which will help you to write a killer CV — and even get the pay rise you want.It’s also really important to be positive — evenyou don’t always feel it.If you are surrounded by miserable, negative people you will end up that way too, so go out of your way to mix with positive, enthusiastic types.It’s very easy to stay in your comfort zone but you’ll never know what you are capable of achieving unless you try. Be brave and start taking risks.Another scenario is that you might not hate your job, but wish you felt more challenged, appreciated or engaged.If that’s the case, write a list of things you would doyou were fearless. Then act asyou were. Take small steps: Speak up in a meeting or put yourself forward for something you’ve never done before.And evenyou fail, be proud that you’ve tried.It’s also important to trust yourself — that’s the first step to improving your self image.If you lack self-confidence you won’t achieve much.You might be thinking, “It’s easy for you to say that — you’re successful”.But after my A-levels I never went to uni, and had no other qualications.I had to work really hard and be super-resilient because I could only ever rely on myself.On the way to success you’ll inevitably experience setbacks — but it’s how you respond to them that determines what happens next. Trust that you can handle them.One of the core communication skills is to be assertive, so try to have faith in your opinions. Sure, respect other people’s views but respect your own too.If you’re hoping for a pay rise or promotion in , I firmly believe thatyou don’t ask you don’t get.If the answer is no the first time round, find out what needs to change and work on that so that next time the answer is a yes.Personally, I never hear the word “No”.I hear: “Find another way to get what you want.”Most importantly, never stop encouraging yourself — and find a network to plug into.To network, you have to be ­interested and interesting. First impressions are made in the first seven seconds so, when you meet someone, make eye contact, smile, be polite — and dress the part.Put your phone away and work out an articulate way to explain who you are in  seconds. Be enthusiastic and be your own best friend.Feeling better about January now  I hope so.If you really want to Get What You Want — sign up to my new Masterclass and make this year all about you.IT’S not really a newsflash that British children are addicted to sugar. But the problem is worse than we might have thought.New research shows that from the age of two, children are consuming an average of almost oz of sugar a day, which is more than twice the recommended maximum daily allowance.This is not just destroying our young people’s teeth. Britain now has the worst obesity rate in Western Europe.Being overweight increases the risk of major health problems including Type  diabetes.So this is an unprecedented health crisis waiting to happen.And the reality is it’s not the fault of the Government, the NHS or the schools – it’s down to parents.It’s our responsibility to read food labels and cook healthy meals from scratch rather than relying on ready meals and takeaways.We also need to teach our kids to make good choices themselves and to develop a taste for healthy food.Unfortunately, though, the hardest word in the English language is “No”.Saying: “No, you can’t have sweets, crisps, fizzy drinks or sugary cereal” can be hard.And, often, it’s so much easier to say yes. Sure, you certainly get an easier le, but you’ll also have an obese, unhealthy and unhappy child.Obesity is now a disease. And it’s almost always a self- inflicted one, which takes years off our lives.The good news is that it’s reversible.Perhaps eating less sugar is one new year’s resolution we should all aspire to keep ANYONE  joining me by doing a Dry January this year I’m becoming a bit of a pro since I seem to do it every year.And while I wish I had some uplting advice about how to get through it, the reality is that I am prepared for a depressing, miserable boring month.The only way to survive it is to not go out, not have friends over, do absolutely zilch and just keep on sipping water.I suppose that’s the whole point, in a way.So welcome to the wagon – but roll on February.HUGE congratulations to Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch on the announcement that they are expecting their fourth child.And also . . . isn’t Abbey looking fabulous in her Instagram snap Most of us, me included, looked like a bag of spuds after two children. But she has three kids already and another on the way and still looks incredible.I guess that’s a combination of good genes, good diet and the right exercise. But whatever she is doing, it’s working. Good for her!SOMETHING tells me that Justin Bieber might regret his new tattoo.He’s had the word “Grace” inked above his eyebrow, which is a lovely sentiment, but at first glance I’m sorry to say it looks a bit like he’s had stitches.And that’s not going to be a great image when he is .I’ve never understood tattoos – let alone on the face – and especially when the result looks like you’ve had a am trip to AE.I’M so happy to hear that every child is going to learn basic first aid including CPR in school to help boost heart attack survival rates.Education Secretary Damian Hinds has announced that he wants all pupils to be able to give emergency care by the time they leave school so more lives can be saved.All I can say is: About time.I did an advanced first aid course and now offer them to all my employees at West Ham. In fact, I actively encourage them to do it.You never know when you might use it, andsomeone does need it you could save their le. Now all schools need to do is bring back home economics lessons so kids can cook for themselves.Then they’ll have some real le skills when they finally leave home.“COULD do better”. That’s the phrase that went through my mind watching Khloe Kardashian twerking on New Year’s Eve for her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson . . . who was completely oblivious.A video showed Khloe shaking her bits and bobs in a silver and black leopard-print bodysuit for Tristan’s benefit – only to look round for a kiss and see that his back was turned.She is a beautul girl and, frankly, she doesn’t have to try so hard.Khloe could be with someone who is genuinely interested in her as opposed to flogging this dead horse. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will it be a General Election, a second referendum, the Government’s deal or a “no deal” exit My guess is that the last two are the most likely.Theresa May’s tactic is to run down the clock until MPs feel they have no option but to back the Government’s deal and avoid a no-deal departure.The Government has been blitzing constituencies to put pressure on MPs via their supporters.But a recent poll indicated that  per cent of Conservative constituency workers think a no-deal Brexit would be better than the PM’s deal.So that tactic hasn’t worked, and a nasty Commons confrontation looms.It is not surprising that David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, has suggested the PM should postpone the vote for a second time.It is the Irish backstop, that tortuous measure which binds Northern Ireland closely to EU regulations, which has caused the most dficulty, particularly as the Government is dependent on DUP votes for its survival.To the DUP it is unacceptable that there should, in effect, be a border down the Irish Sea. To Conservative MPs there is also the danger of being locked into the backstop indefinitely and that, having already agreed to accept £billion, the EU would have no incentive to move on and negotiate a decent Free Trade agreement.If the PM could somehow get firm assurances from the EU that would guarantee the backstop was definitely a temporary measure then that might persuade MPs, including the DUP, to change their minds.After all,the backstop is only temporary, all the things that are objectionable in the backstop, such as the inability to sign new trade deals, are also only temporary.It is not impossible that there could be a concession on these lines. Butthe Government is defeated in the Commons, what then In some ways the PM’s hand might be strengthened and she could say to Brussels that it is absolutely clear the present deal cannot get through ­Parliament.The EU will maintain that its offer is final, but this would not be the first time the EU has said that, only for a new offer to then appear.Opponents of Brexit cling to the hope that defeat in the Commons will lead either to a second referendum or a General Election. But neither will happen automatically.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a General Election can only be heldParliament votes for one or the Government loses a vote of ­confidence.The DUP don’t want Jeremy Corbyn as PM and as long as Mrs May’s deal has not passed, the DUP will continue to support the Government.A second referendum could only happenthe Government introduced legislation for one. No Conservative PM would survive doing that.The remaining option is the so- called no-deal Brexit, which really means trading on World Trade ­Organisation terms with both the EU and the rest of the world.This is how much of world trade is conducted and how many countries outside the EU trade with the EU.Strictly speaking there is no such thing as a no-deal Brexit.There would be many side deals covering administrative areas that are not strictly trade, such as health regulations, safety, aviation, transportion of animals and so on.No one is claiming there would be no problems. Inevitably there will be some, but they would essentially be short term, and we would not face a bill of £billion.Leaving without a deal is feared by some large businesses anxious that integrated manufacturing supply chains might be interrupted. But Britain imports manufacturing components already from many non-EU areas of the world. These issues are solvable.Roberto Azevedo, Director General of the World Trade Organisation, has said there is no reason why trading on WTO terms should lead to disruption.He presumably knows what he is talking about.But the Government seems unable to make up its mind about a no-deal Brexit.Originally the PM boldly declared: “No deal is better than a bad deal”. Presumably she meant it.But recently the Government has launched Project Fear Mark , highlighting the alleged disaster of a no-deal Brexit in a lurid way.This campaign provoked a civil servant to write a remarkable anonymous article in a national ­newspaper declaring that “the civil ­service was ready for no-deal”, advanced preparations had been made and she accused the Government of deliberately concealing the work that had been done in order to pressurise MPs to swallow the ­Government’s “disastrous deal”.It seems probable that the Government will not be able to get the PM’s deal through Parliament and so will have to go back to Brussels, not just once, but maybe several times.If the EU refuses to budge, the automatic legal position is that the UK will leave on March , eventhere is no deal and stalemate in Parliament.There is very little that Parliament can do to stop that now. It is what Parliament has voted for in the past.My guess is that the EU may well come up with some concession, perhaps a legally binding clarication, and that there will be a lot of arguing, probably right up to midnight on March .But whatever happens, the next day we will leave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Building conventional weaponry can be done without raising the same levels of alarm as nuclear ones.”The bomb has been compared to the USs ,lb GBU- B Massive Ordnance Air Blast - dubbed the Mother Of All Bombs - which killed  jihadis when it was used for the first time in Afghanistan last year.It is so large it has to be carried by a slow Hercules transporter aircraft.Chinas new weapon is said to be smaller and lighter so it can be delivered to its target by a faster jet bomber.Experts say it appears to be a fuel-air explosive, a controversial type of weapon known for causing horrible injuries.Just before impact the device squirts out a cloud of liquid or gas explosive which fills buildings and is ignited by the main charge.That creates a huge and long-lasting pressure wave - greater than in conventional high explosives - which ruptures the lungs and bowels of people at the edge of the blast radius.And any unburnt fuel is as toxic to survivors as chemical weapons.Russia is known to have stockpiled similar weapons and Bashar Assad is said to have used one against rebels in Syria.News of the Chinese bomb comes days after President Xi Jinping threatened to blow up US warships and vowed to take back Taiwan by force.He also ordered his two-million-strong Army to maintain full preparedness for war."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000460316471.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"how bees feasting on mms from nearby factory made blue honey that baffled french beekeepers","story":"Bees at several colonies in parts of northern France had mysteriously been producing honey in mysterious shades for months.It was soon discovered leftovers from containers of MM sweets being processed at a nearby biogas plant were to blame.Beekeepers near Ribeauville, in Alsace, noticed bees ing to their hives carrying unidentied colourful substances which quickly turned their honey unnatural shades.They launched an investigation and found a factory two miles away has been processing waste from a nearby plant producing MMs -  sweets in bright coloured shells.However, the honey proved a real headache for around a dozen affected beekeepers because they just couldnt sell it, said Alain Frieh, president of the apiculturists’ union.The story first hit the headlines in , but is recirculating on social media after pics of the blue honey emerged via a science site.Agrivalor, the company operating the biogas plant, said it had tried to address the problem after being contacted by the concerned beekeepers.“We discovered the problem at the same time they did.

Right ahead.”Then we all sat and waited for the impact that would surely follow.And waited . . . and waited, as Gemma remained stubbornly upright for the duration.Such is le at Dancing On Ice, “the show where anything could happen”, according to the continuity announcer, but never actually does.That’s the main reason why people stopped watching and ITV buried it in a cold and shallow grave five years ago.Then, without much warning or any great demand, it was suddenly brought back to le, last year, and proved every bit as underwhelming and injury free as I remembered.There’s no horse too dead for another ITV flogging, though, so it’s just ed for yet another run, with most of the same fixtures and fittings.Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby do a solid enough job of hosting, considering their script could suck a black hole inside out, and there’s a four- man Ice Panel where the truth bombs are exclusively supplied by Jason Gardiner, who arrived dressed as Bret Maverick for Sunday’s opening show.What seems to separate this year’s Dancing On Ice from almost every other series, however, is the line-up. It’s actually quite imaginative and offers the show a serious chance of redemption,just one of them can be hospitalised before the end of the run.Among the  contenders, we’ve got: Westle’s Brian McFadden, Richard “Hollywood is the catalyst for everything I do” Blackwood, cricketer Ryan Sidebottom, and Saira Khan, who was advised by Ruth Langsford to “do Strictly”, but is a bit too low rent for the BBC so is stuck here wearing skates and tights.Despite having two hours to fill, none of that lot actually got to dance on Sun- day, though, as, I suspect, ITV wanted to clear the decks for its preferred bookings.These include -year-old Didi Conn , from Grease, Corrie’s Jane Danson, who was put in “a horse lt, with half rotation”, and Mark “Joe Mangel” Little, who’s turned into Dog The Bounty Hunter since we last saw him on Neighbours.But let’s not kid ourselves here. The reason many of us probably tuned in, on Sunday, in was to see Gemma Collins.Towie’s self-styled “GC” the first letter of which stands for Gigantic. A woman who really could do with a heavy landing on that over-entitled a**e of hers or, better still, developing a work ethic and some humility.I prayed for the worst then, and saved what was left for her partner, Matt Evers, but he’d clearly taken one look at Gemma and thought “screw that for le without a disability allowance”.There were no lts, no falls and she didn’t even have the decency to rip her drawers when she tried the splits. Sunday was just another entry in DOI’s endless list of crushing disappointments.Partly thanks to some very sympathetic marking, from everyone except Jason, Gemma will also get to skate again in a fortnight, which, I think I’m right in saying, means they’ll have to make an attempt at the infamous “King Kong lt”.And then, once Addison Lee has dropped her off at the rink, it’s on with the skating.Piers Morgan: “I bumped into Gemma Collins in Langan’s restaurant, at Christmas, and . . . ”A “She’s OK, actually.”B “A Japanese sports network bought the footage for million yen.”THE expression TV gold doesn’t begin to do justice to BBC’s fly-on-the-wall documentary about Matt and Luke Goss’s O reunion gig.It’s a genuine masterpiece that would deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Spinal Tap,the pair of them weren’t so wonderfully serious about everything.Bros: After The Screaming Stops is the title of the film, directed by David Soutar and Joe Pearlman, who had the good sense just to point their cameras at the boys and let them say things like: “I made a conscious decision, because of Stevie Wonder, not to be superstitious.” “Rome wasn’t built in a day, f*** me that’s true, but we don’t have the time Rome did.” “He was a rectangle, I was a rectangle and together we made a square, which is a fortress.” And “There were  one-way streets and one solitary two-way street, where me and my brother met in the middle.” .As well as all the tortured metaphors and Matt’s profundities, though, the film also features a fantastically earnest rant about conkers and an escalating feud between the boys, which should have had every single viewer crying out for both of them to be included in the next I’m A Celebrity line-up, pretty much from the word go.But how did I feel at the end of this emotional dual carriageway In the words of poet philosopher singer Matt Goss: “Two words. Privileged.”John Humphrys: “At least  of the  books of the New Testament are usually attributed to which author ”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “New Year’s Day in the UK, January or December ”Lauren: “December.”And Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In , Mark Calaway, who’s better known as The Undertaker, retired from which sport ”Gerry: “Golf.”The Voice UK fooling me into thinking it might go a whole episode without Jenner Hudson “spontaneously” bursting into song.Luther turning out to be a soulless, unpleasant, far-fetched mess.

Picture research: Amy Reading.TV dramatists haven’t yet rewritten the result of Brexit.But, trust me, they will eventually. This is just the start of the softening-up process.Brexit: The Uncivil War, a Channel  production that toyed with neutrality, for about  minutes, but had given up any pretence long before the drama’s rather desperate postscript finally stopped trying to nudge viewers in the Remainer direction.The two main characters weren’t entirely subtle either.One, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, was Dominic Cummings, the hi-vis dork who was in charge of the Leave campaign.The other, “I’M IN” leader Craig Oliver, whose portrayal, by Rory Kinnear, as a brilliant-but-tragic hero, was rather undermined by the fact Craig Oliver was also one of the drama’s political advisers.What saved The Uncivil War, though, was the acting, particularly Paul Ryan’s Nigel Farage turn, and Cumberbatch, who wasn’t a perfect fit for Cummings as his Durham accent slipped too often.It’s a performance brimming with such mesmerising charisma, though, I can genuinely see The Uncivil War effecting genuine change – two extra zeroes on Dominic Cummings’ next salary.Such is the real power of TV drama.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Downing Street insiders hinted the Prime Minister believed she could get a written guarantee that Brussels would commit to a start date for the future relationship. Brussels officials suggested they were prepared to help by offering an “exchange of letters” confirming their plan for trade talks to conclude by . But they warned it was unlikely to be a legally binding deadline, increasing the chances of it not being enough to win over sceptical Tory MPs. Mrs May insisted today that work was still ongoing with the EU to obtain the “further assurances” she needs to get her orce deal through the Commons.   She said the Government would also be looking at what it could do to give MPs more say in negotiations over the future relationship. This could include giving MPs the right to serve  months notice that the UK planned to quit the controversial Irish backstopBrussels dragged its feet on a trade deal. She hopes a written guarantee on a date for the future trading relationship would effectively limit the need for the hated Irish backstop to no more than a year. The PM made another desperate plea to EU leaders, including Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, last week with more calls expected in coming days. A No  source said: “If we are going to get something we would expect it before the vote. It will be written down and have genuine meaning.” However, the key document is not expected before MPs begin debating Brexit again on Wednesday.   There have been reports whips were plotting a backbench amendment to the vote - now due on January  - which would order yet more talks with the EUthe PM is still heading for a huge defeat. Downing Street did little to dispel rumours it could cancel February recess or even force MPs to sit at weekends to get seven key bills through before Brexit day. Labour is to support a backbench amendment, tabled by Yvette Cooper, that could block taxation powers unless a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table. Jeremy Corbyn described the PM’s plans as a “Frankenstein’s monster of a deal” and accused her of being prepared to “push our whole economy off a clf edge” with no deal.   No  held urgent talks with whips and the Treasury after at least nine Tory rebels, led by former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, signed the amendment with more expected to follow. Tory MP Nick Boles, another backer, told the Mirror: “There will be more bills the Government will want to pass before Brexit day. We’ll be seeking to use any and every opportunity to show that Parliament will not allow a no deal Brexit. This is a single skirmish in a long campaign.” The SNP, Lib Dems and smaller opposition parties are also expected to back the parliamentary guerrilla war to avoid the UK crashing out without a deal. However, the Treasury is understood to be “reasonably relaxed” about the finance bill going through amended as they believe the changes would only have a relatively minor impact.   Whitehall insiders said the plan would not be able to prevent a no deal Brexit as the clause was only intended to deliver a few tweaks to keep tax law working. Nikki da Costa, former No  director of legislative affairs, said: My feel is that while Yvette Cooper et al have found a vehicle to present this as the first big battle of , and some are trying to win the PR battle by saying that it puts government in lock down, its merely a skirmish. It came as a minister broke ranks with the PM to say the Government may have to extend article  to delay the UKs departure from the EU. Digital minister Margot James said that persuading warring MPs to back Mrs Mays plan was the best way of preventing a no deal Brexit. If that proves to be impossible then I think we need to - we have very little time left but we might have to extend article , she added. Later, Brexit minister Steve Barclay did not rule out keeping the option on the table, simply saying it was the Governments firm intention not to extend it.

Ministers sparked outrage when it was announced EU citizens would have to pay the Home Office for the right to live in the UK indefinitely after Brexit. Many businesses, including Heathrow Airport and Carluccios, have committed to meeting the charge on behalf of their workers. And the Scottish Government has promised to refund the fee for public sector workers in Scotland. But Business Minister Richard Harrington last night confirmed the UK Government would not follow suit and pay the fee for civil servants and departmental staff.   In reply to a written question from Labour MP Catherine West, Mr Harrington said: “The UK Government currently does not plan to pay the Settled Status Fee for its non-UK EU citizen employees. The fee is set at an affordable rate , less than the cost of a UK passport. “We value the signicant contribution made by EU citizens working in the Civil Service and we want these colleagues to continue to play a full role in the work of the Civil Service. “We are committed to supporting our EU citizen employees across the Civil Service, the important engagement with EU national networks across government will continue over the coming months.”   Ms West, a Best for Britain Champion, said: “I’m extremely disappointed that the Department for Business, Energy  Industrial Strategy doesn’t intend to set an example for other businesses and pay for their hard working EU staff to stay. “It’s shameful that EU citizens living, working and contributing so much to our country are being forced to pay to stay here. “Many of the security, cleaning and support staff at BEIS are on low wages and asking them to hand over pound is another way they’re being made to feel unwelcome by their own Government” "},{"url":null,"title":"true story behind brexit uncivil","story":"NewsTrue story behind Brexit: The Uncivil War - how much is based on fact How closely does the film match the reality of the Brexit campaign ShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsBenedict Cumberbatch as Dominic Cummings with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, played by Richard Goulding and Oliver Maltman \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrexit: The Unvicil War is based on the true - and often unbelievable - events that led up to the  referendum - where the Leave campaign succeeded against the expectations of many. The Channel  drama, to be broadcast tonight, sees Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch play Dominic Cummings, the maverick strategist behind the Vote Leave campaign. But how closely does the film match the reality of the Brexit campaign  The opening moments of the film, written by highly regarded playwright James Graham, state that some events in the film have been invented for dramatic purposes. But some of the most bizarre moments are genuinely closer to the truth than you might think. Heres some of the more unbelievable moments from the film - and how the on-screen depiction matches up to the reality.  The arch Brexiteer and Vote Leave board member was shown in the film exercising in a wood-led room - presumably his office - on a full-size gym cross trainer. But does he really have one  We asked Sir Bernards office whether his office has a cross trainer in it. A spokesperson replied: Absolutely not. There was. In fact, the Department of Health threatened to sue the Vote Leave campaign over their use of the logo.A government spokesman said: The NHS is one of Britain’s best-loved institutions and its distinctive brand is rightly protected against exploitation. They added added: A wealth of independent authorities – the IFS, the Bank of England and the IMF – have all said that leaving the EU would damage the economy, so that means less money for the NHS, not more. And yes, its also true that Vote Leaves response was largely to ignore their threats. A spokesman said: Reheating  month old legal threats that have amounted to nothing, shows the desperation of the In campaign that are losing the argument and momentum  They did. As far back as , Eurosceptics including MPs Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless and Tory MEP Daniel Hannan met in secret in the London art gallery. Theyassumed no party whip or journalist would expect any political plotters to hang around in an art gallery. They became known as the Tate Plotters. Did Vote Leave really harvest the data of Facebook users from a football competition   Yes. The campaign launched a competition on the social network, offering a pound million prize. They said it was to promote their claim that the UK sends pound million a day to the EU. But among the benefits is that it gave Vote leave access to the personal data of people who took part in the contest - which they could then use to target advertising.

Maxwell Bates-Spiers, widely known as Max Spiers, died in Warsaw, where he had travelled to speak at a conference in April . An inquest heard how the -year-old took the Turkish form of the drug Xanax while suffering from pneumonia. He died on July  at the house of Monika Duval, , who let him stay there after they met at the conference. An inquest into the death of Mr Bates-Spiers, held on Monday in Sandwich, Kent, heard a cause of death given by a pathologist was complications caused by pneumonia and intoxication by drugs. Mr Bates-Spiers, a drug user who had been addicted to heroin and crack cocaine, bought eight to  boxes of the Turkish Xanax during a holiday to Cyprus with Ms Duval and took several tablets on the day of his death. A post-mortem examination also discovered levels of oxycodone, an opiod, in his system at a potentially fatal level, the inquest heard.  A pathologist also discovered there was a rather widespread pneumonia. A statement from Ms Duval, who the hearing was told had an informal relationship with Mr Bates-Spiers, said he fell asleep on her sofa after taking the Xanax, before she noticed he had stopped breathing several hours later. He then began to vomit as she tried resuscitation while waiting for paramedics, the inquest heard. She said: I noticed he had something in his mouth, some remnants of food, so I turned him on to one side and saw gastric fluids pouring out of him - brown liquid, like somewhat tea coloured. Paramedics were called, but Mr Bates-Spiers died at the scene, the inquest heard. A summary of the Polish prosecutors offices inquiry, which was read to the inquest, said he had exchanged numbers with Ms Duval after they attended the Earth Project conference.  He was described as a journalist dealing with the topics of conspiracy theories and paranormal phenomena, the inquest heard. Ms Duval agreed shortly after they met to let him stay at her house, rather than take hisplane ticket back to Britain. After picking him up from his hotel, she took him to a doctors surgery and bought him medication worth more than , Polish zloty . The inquest was told he often suffered illness while staying with her and sometimes he felt weak and sometimes he had problems with focus and attention. He also complained satanic groups were after him in the lead up to his death, Ms Duvals statement said. The inquest heard he bought the Turkish Xanax equivalent during a holiday with her to Cyprus from June  to July , when he visited a pharmacy and found the drug could be bought without a prescription.  Mr Bates-Spiers asked Ms Duval to buy the entire stock, about eight to  boxes, of the drug and she fulfilled that request, according to the Polish prosecutors office . Referring to the day of his death, the PPO statement added: He probably took  tablets of Turkish Xanax, at the same time explaining to Ms Duval that it was an adequate dose because its Turkish equivalent has a dferent dosage. The PPO said the death was caused by natural causes and excluded participation of further persons, the inquest heard. A British toxicologist, David Rose, told the hearing Mr Bates-Spiers had levels of Xanax in his system at twice the therapeutic dose. He also discovered levels of oxycodone which could be fatal in an inexperienced user, the inquest heard. Mr Bates-Spiers GP, Dr Cecily Fahey, told the hearing he had been addicted to a iety of medications. In July , he told Turning Point, a drug and alcohol help service, that he injected two bags each of heroin and crack cocaine daily with occasional use of cannabis, the inquest heard. The inquest, which is scheduled to last three days, continues.

People whose income has been hit by benefit reforms and stagnating wages are suffering the le-changing effect of high-interest loan repayment demands at a time of unmanageable rises in the cost of food and energy. Michael has been criss-crossing the country to meet those affected by payday loans, short-term loans and rent-to-buy outlets. He has founded the End High Cost Credit Alliance to establish a stronger network of lenders that provide credit without exploiting people.  How to save trapped renters and fix the housing market - bold new plan revealed Joining forces with Michael’s shyalliance, the Mirror today launches our Fair Credit For All campaign. We want to ensure those most in need are not forced into the clutches of high-interest lenders. Unfair It comes as figures from a TUC study show personal debt has hit its worst-ever levels in Britain, with the total amount at poundbillion – or pound, for the average household. It was on one of hisvisits to his native South Wales that Michael, , first encountered a debt crisis that was taking a stranglehold. Families were being torn apart by spiralling debts to payday lenders like Wonga and rent-to-own companies. “I would go back to South Wales as often as possible,” the BAFTA-nominated actor tells me. “I started to hear more and more in those visits of people getting into trouble with debt. “And I started hearing about high-cost loans, high-cost credit, payday loans, rent-to-own businesses.   “The people that needed help… were getting the most unfair deal. “Family and close friends were starting to get into trouble with debt. “I started to realise how thin the line is between doing all right and suddenly getting into real trouble. It’s not some cataclysmic thing that happens – it can be an unexpected bill, or something as simple as a washing machine breaking down. “[It] can spiral and be very dficult to get out of, with related issues to do with mental and physical health. “I grew up in a community in which people thought that you don’t get into debt. It’s becoming unavoidable now.” The TUC study shows unsecured debt – which includes credit cards and loans but not mortgages – has gone up by almost half since the Tories came to power in . Separate analysis by the Centre for Responsible Credit and Jubilee Debt Campaign found the unsecured debt to income ratio for the poorest fth of families rose from % to % between  and . During a superb career including memorable performances as Tony Blair in The Queen, and The Deal, Michael never neglected his roots. He worked in his hometown of Port Talbot for two years off and on, living there once again for much of . He found in this time that people in debt often had no option but to use high-interest lenders, or turned to disreputable firms because they mistakenly believed there was no choice.   Michael decided to restore some balance to a deal heavily weighted in favour of the lenders. The strategy for the End High Cost Credit Alliance, which he set up with his own money, is not just to get rid of the bad guys. That would mean those who require quick credit might have nowhere to go. His umbrella organisation wants to ensure fair providers have the resources to take on thousands of new clients. He spoke as he visited organisations in Greater Manchester including the shyLighthouse Project, which has ious aims including to help alleviate poverty. Explaining how the End High Cost Credit Alliance is his top priority, he says: “Now the acting is to support the other work rather than the other work being a sideline and the acting the main thing. “I’m upfront when people offer me a job. I tell them what I need to be available for. Andwe can work that out, then great. If I can’t, I’ll have to do something .” With that the man described as the greatest stage actor of his generation is back on the road, to estates where the tragedy caused by debt needs no shyscriptwriter for dramatic impact. The TUCs Frances OGrady has her say Household debt is at crisis levels. Years of austerity and wage stagnation has pushed millions of families into the red. A decade of Tory austerity has come at a high price for working people. Just paying for basics, like food, bills and rent, has become a battle.  The Government claims it is “making working pay”. But try telling that to families who rely on payday loans or food banks. For those driven into the red, the poverty and anxiety is bad enough, but there’s a danger for the whole nation. We can’t keep Britain’s economy growing on household debt. Eventually it will come crashing down. The only foundation for our economy is wage growth. That’s why we need a higher minimum wage of pound an hour. Too much wealth is hoarded at the top. Working people need more bargaining power to get their fair share. That means giving trade unions the freedom to enter every workplace to negotiate fair pay. Working poverty is not inevitable. We must redesign the economy to make it fair. The shocking statsWages increased by an average of .% last year but real pay is still pound a week lower than it was before the  financial crisis. Many of those forced to take out high-interest, short-term loans are unemployed, so such increases mean little to them. Inflation was up to .% in August . The cost of many daily essentials is rising faster than the rate of inflation. Rail fares have risen three times faster than wages since Tories came to power in .

Luke Glendennings family are struggling to come to terms with his death, the inquest heard, with a statement from his mum saying he has left a massive hole in their lives.The youngster was perfectly healthy when he went in for surgery on November , , but fatal complications meant he died just days later. In the days after his first operation Luke endured five more surgeries to try and save his le but they were unsuccessful and his family eventually had to turn his le support off. The hearing was told how doctors had dficulty accessing Lukes left kidney, that a large amount of fluid emerged around his organs and that he suffered internal bleeding. In a statement read out in court, his distraught mother Sue Hirst, , says she has serious concerns about what should have been a routine procedure.   Miss Hirsts statement said: We have serious concerns as a family, regarding the death of Luke. He was a fit and able young man whos lost his le after what should have been a routine procedure. I cannot come to terms with the fact he has died. He was my only child. I miss him dearly, it has left a massive hole in our lives. Wakefield Coroners Court, West Yorkshire, also heard from Dr Nasim Tahir, a paediatric radiologist at Leeds Childrens Hospital, who oversaw the surgery on November , . Dr Tahir explained the operation involved inserting a camera into Lukes kidney and then using a laser to break the stones down and remove them. He said surgeons had to make six punctures into Lukes kidney in order to create space for the camera but that ordinarily it would only take one.   Dr Tahir said: There was no way of knowing for sure that we would encounter the dficulty that we did on the day. Its not asyou can plan the whole procedure beforehand. Dr Tahir said there were discussions between himself and other doctors about whether the operation should have been aborted after five failed attempts at making a hole. He added: The decision to carry on was because we had already done the trickiest bits. I dont think it was an excessive amount of punctures and there was nothing to indicate we were doing more harm than good. Even now I would do the exact same as what I did then. Towards the end of the five-hour operation, doctors noticed Luke was unable to maintain his own blood pressure, the court heard. His legs had also gone pale and he had suffered a rectal prolapse and a distended abdomen, which means his stomach was severely swollen, doctors said. He also had contracted compartment syndrome, a condition affecting the muscles which can result in death.   They told Miss Hirst and Lukes father Richard Glendenning they could not remove all the stones because Luke had an abnormally formed kidney. Scans revealed Luke had fluid on his lungs and in his chest and he underwent another surgery that evening to remove his left kidney. Luke underwent his third operation in under  hours in the early hours of November , , this time to try and drain some of the fluid from his body. Following that operation the youngsters extremities were cold and his skin was starting to turn yellow, according to a statement provided to the court by Miss Hirst. Doctors were also struggling to find Lukes pulse and he was taken back into theatre to remove packs that had been placed to drain the fluid, but which might have affected his breathing. Following that operation he was taken into intensive care and placed on a machine that supported his heart and lungs. However, Lukes heart stopped beating and he underwent a sixth and final operation to try and restart it, after which he was placed on le support. Miss Hirst, a neighbourhood team coordinator for Leeds Community NHS, and Mr Glendenning, a builder, had to call in family to say their goodbyes to Luke. They switched the le support machine off on November . Assistant coroner Oliver Longstaff, presiding over the inquest, said the word tragic is probably too light to be used in this case. The inquest continues.

The former Truro city councillor still went on holiday to Butlins soon after the win, Cornwall Live reports. His first decision was to do something for the Merlin MS Centre in Cornwall as his late we Rosemary suffered from the condition for  years. He asked the charity what they wanted and the answer was a hot tub the largest hot tub in the country – a high tech anti-gravity pound million hydrotherapy pool for those suffering from MS, strokes, Parkinson’s and ME.   And Peters familys lives have all changed forever.All three of his children – Helen, Sharon and Anthony – now have new mortgage-free houses and brand new cars.His  grandchildren have or will have the same too - as will his three great-grandchildren and the one thats on the way. The lucky -year-old, who still does the lottery every week, said: “I used to go into shops and think it would be nice to have this and that, but now I can have what I want.” That includes a BMW i, an electric BMW i, Porsche Cayman in its own unique colour, a Bentley, and the last three Land Rover Defenders made .   Other purchases have included a pound, watch from Michael Spiers jewellers in Truro, a helicopter trip to the Cheltenham Gold Cup and two static caravans kept at his beloved Butlins in Minehead. But he ensures he keeps himself grounded, saying “I still own the house on Trelanderand would go back in a shot – I loved living there.” It was May , , when Peter Congdon checked his Wednesday Lotto ticket on Teletext as usual.“I’ve got pound,” he thought. “Oh no, it’s not...” Shocked, he walked to his daughter’s house ten doors down from him who double-checked the ticket - and it was certainly a lot more than pound. Peter had won just over pound. million.   The multi-millionaire said: “I couldn’t believe it then and I still can’t really believe it now.” The pool hes funding for the Merlin MS Centre will open in February.It will prove a leline for many and Peter’s kindness has even brought some sufferers to tears, with one man looking forward for his first dip in water for  years. The building will be painted primrose with the flowers planted outside as they were Rosemary’s favourite. Peter and his family have raised thousands for Merlin over the years on top of his poundm donation.   This includes donating a brand new Land Rover as a raffle prize, holding bingo competitions and taking part in a parachute jump. But Peter still gets emails and letters from strangers begging for money three years after his win. Daughter Helen Venton said: “We had funny letters from the beginning – including one man who wanted a coffin for his own funeral. We received the first letter on the actual night of the win – a woman wanted help paying off her husband’s gambling debts.” They have also had requests from strangers askingPeter will pay for weddings. One came all the way from Australia, addressed to Peter Congdon, Lottery Winner, Truro, Cornwall.   But Helen said: “We’ve been on the other end, trying to find money for prom dresses, for example.” That’s why Peter now loans out his flashy cars for school proms, only asking for a donation to the MS Centre in exchange.It’s all about “little gestures”, he says.Those gestures include paying for Tregolls School’s fireworks display for the past three years and funding campaign leaflets for Melissa Mead, the Penryn mum who recently received the MBE for her work raising awareness of sepsis. How much is left of Peter’s cash then  “I’ve got enough for this week,” he said.  He’s made investments and put some of the money in property, owning three houses at Trelander and three at Hendra in Truro. The family say they also fall victim of rumour and gossip. One of Peter’s relatives was shopping for nappies in Tesco when she heard a woman saying: “You’d think she’d find somewhere better to shop.” Peter said: Camelot were great, offering us a financial adviser and which banks we should use. They also respond to the begging letterswe forward them.

The dish traditionally consists of two halves of an English muffin, toasted, and topped with a poached egg, bacon or ham and a generous portion of hollandaise sauce. Diner Thomas Hesketh was tempted by the sound of the meal when he spotted it on a menu in Wigan Tesco, reports Manchester Evening News. But he was left feeling less that impressed with what he was presented with after paying for it.   The disgruntled man tweeted a picture of his plate, which featured two poached eggs on a pair of folded slices of ham, topped with globules of hollandaise sauce.

Matthew Hughes, , went on a diet to sht some of his weight after ballooning to st lbs in his mid-s. But, despite ditching takeaways and sugary food as part of his staple diet - Matthew allowed himself to enjoy a two finger KitKat each night since starting his weight loss journey in January last year, He said he used the chocolatey snack as a way to keep him motivated. The data analyst, from Widnes in Cheshire, has struggled with obesity since childhood and decided to lose weight after seeing pictures of himself at a friends party. Six foot Matthew, who now weighs a healthy st lbs, has gone from wearing XL t-shirts and -inch waist trousers to fitting into large tops and -inch skinny jeans. And Matthew, who lives with his partner Kerrie Murphy, , loves nothing more than telling people how he ate chocolate to lose weight.  Matthew said: I can genuinely say that I have eaten chocolate to lose weight. I love telling people that. Every night since I made my New Years resolution to start dieting, I have eaten a two finger KitKat. Its been great. Its about understanding that you can have treats as long as they are a treat and not something youre indulging in three or four times a day. I knowI eat good stuff all day, I can have the KitKat every evening without worrying and that has really kept me going. Youve got to reward yourself. Just because its a diet doesnt mean you cant enjoy it. Even now that Im maintaining my weight, I still have that KitKat after my tea every night without fail. Throughout school Matthew was bullied for being overweight but his happy go lucky nature saw him embrace being the big lad and shrug off the cruel taunts. A lack of food education in the s, saw Matthew continue to make unhealthy choices well into adulthood.  As well as bingeing on crisps and chocolate bars, every day Matthew would guzzle two pints of full fat milk and five mugs of milky tea, each containing three sugars. Matthew gorged on five takeaways a week and saw the pounds pile on, crushing his self-confidence and seriously damaging his health. At his biggest, Matthew suffered with daily back pain and would be left completely out of breath after climbing a few stairs or going on a short walk. He also found it impossible to find any high street clothes to fit his bulky frame, instead being forced to buy from specialist online shops. Matthew said: I have aways been the big lad, for as long as I can remember. I did used to get bullied a lot for my weight but at the time I felt like it didnt bother me. Ive always been a bit of a happy go lucky character and I shrugged it all off. It wasnt until I started losing weight and started to feel better about myself that I realised how much it had been affecting me - physically and emotionally.  When I was a kid there wasnt the awareness and education about healthy eating that there is now. As a kid you dont care and I started snacking constantly on crisps and chocolate bars. That continued through my adult le. Instead of having three solid meals, I would snack all through the day on sandwiches, crisps and chocolate. People always assumeyoure big you must drink loads of fizzy drinks but milk was my downfall and tea with three sugars. I was bad with fast food too. I would eat takeaways about five times a week. Usually KFC or McDonalds. Despite the crippling affects on his physical and mental wellbeing - and an embarrassing incident with a turnstile at a Manchester United match - Matthew remained in denial until an unflattering photo brought home the reality of his size. After his wake up call, Matthew started doing Slimming World from home, reading every book he could to re-educate himself about food. Since swapping all his unhealthy snacking and fast food binges for three home-cooked meals and one KitKat a day, Matthew has watched his excess fat melt away. His new svelte figure has not only boosted his self-esteem but given Matthew a whole new lease of le - and he even now has the energy to hit the gym four times a week. Matthew, who has now maintained his size for eight months, does a combination of cardio and weightlting to tone up his body as his dramatic weight loss has left him with some loose skin.  Matthew said: At my heaviest I started to get really out of breath and tired after just going upstairs or doing a short walk. And my lower back was always sore. I couldnt buy clothes anywhere on the high street and had to start using specialist shops online. One day I went to watch my football team play and I almost didnt fit through the turnstile. It was so embarrassing that I havent been back since. Youd think that all these things would have made me want to change and would have been that turning point moment but I was in denial. Then I went to a friends birthday party and when I saw the photos I knew I needed to turn things around. Id seen so many photos of myself in the past and thought wow Im big but then I would just push it to the back of my mind. This time it really hit home. In January , I started doing Slimming World and I havent looked back since. Ive had to completely re-educate myself on food and how to eat healthy. Now everything I have is fresh and home-cooked. Preparation is key. I feel so much better for it. Its like Ive been given a new lease of le. Im so much more confident and Ive got loads more energy. The loose skin can be hard to accept but I would much rather look the way I do now than how I did before. Sometimes I look in the mirror or at a photo and I cant believe its actually me. Ive got so much more self-esteem. Im really proud of what Ive achieved. As well as using his daily KitKat as a motivational treat, Matthew encourages others starting their own weight loss journeys this January to celebrate every achievement.  Matthew thinks people should give themselves a mental high five for every target they meet and use lots of before and after photos to keep track of their progress. Matthew said: My main aim when I set out on my journey was to enjoy it. I didnt look at it as dieting and restricting myself, I saw it as a lestyle change. I was going to make my le better. I think its so important to have that mentality and celebrate every single milestone whether its to do with the numbers you see on the scales or something . I would give myself a mental high five every time I lost half a stone and every time I entered a new stone bracket. But at the same time, I would celebrate every time I had to tighten my belt a notch and the first time I ever fit into a pair of skinny jeans. It was amazing. I never thought Id be able to wear them. Another great moment was when a woman at work who hadnt seen me since I was big didnt recognise me until she saw my before picture on Instagram. It gave me such a good buzz. People need to congratulate themselves for all those victories and try to enjoy every moment of their weight loss. Have fun with it. It can be hard to see your own progress so the best way for me was to do lots of before and after photos. It really helps you realise how well youre doing.

Viana, , who is a Brazilian UFC star and president of the sport, then lashed out and used her mixed martial arts moves to keep the alleged would-be thief in a chokehold until police arrived. Speaking about her ordeal, Viana, who has one  of her  professional fights, said the man had originally walked up to her asking for the time.

Then he put his hand over [a gun], but I realised it was too soft.   He was really close to me. So I thought, If it’s a gun, he won’t have time to draw it, so I stood up I threw two punches and a kick. After getting him in an MMA chokehold, Viana then told the man, Now we’ll wait for the police, as they both sat on the floor. She said she was calm throughout the incident because the thief did not attempt to fight back as passers-by called the police.   Viana said the man seemed scared and begged to be let go, claiming he Just asked for the time. Pictures of the man after the incident showed him bloodied as he waited for police to arrive at the scene.

According to Royal experts, The Queen was even sworn at by her now -year-old husband during her time in Malta in the late s. Maltese journalist John Mizzi claimed the -year-old Monarch spent the happiest days of her le in Malta, where she was able to freely immerse herself in shopping, sightseeing and dancing. He also claimed that while the Queen was the boss in public, private le between the couple, who have been married for  years, was very dferent and Prince Philip was the one who ran the show. He said: He seemed to boss her around most of the time.  “I shouldn’t say this perhaps, I heard him swearing at her., reports the Express. And according to writer and broadcaster Hugo Vickers and Royal correspondent Camilla Tominey, the Queen actually liked the fact Philip was able to tell her off. Hugo said: The thing with the Queen and Prince Philip is that they both are very, very well matched. She took on somebody her own size. “He is the one person who can categorically tell hersomething is not going well. He can talk to her directly and he does.”  Camilla Tominey added that the Queen is aware she married someone who doesnt mince their words and that Prince Philip offered a refreshing change. In the  documentary, she explained: I think the Queen herself would be the first one to admit that Prince Philip isn’t somebody who minces his words, who has an opinion on everything and doesn’t mind expressing it. “For the Queen herself, when you consider she is surrounded by a lot of yes men, actually having a man in her le who tells her what he thinks of what she’s doing is probably a refreshing change.  “He does wear the trousers behind palace doors and he is the head of the family and he has made a lot of changes in Buckingham Palace that have been for the better.” Their love story began when the Queen was just  after she met her future husband during a visit to the naval college in Dartmouth. Historian and biographer, Robert Lacy, recalled the moment love sparked between the lelong couple. He said: One of the most extraordinary things about the Queen is that she fell in love and married just about the first man she met.

Meat-eater: This “bleeding burger” is designed to mimic rare meat. It looks weird and tastes bland, and isn’t a patch on a succulent bloody steak. My mushroom, beetroot and coconut oil patty was pale, floppy and failed to bleed…the only thing that could possibly have made it exciting. Vegetarian: Possibly the worst burger I’ve had – and since becoming a vegetarian at age , I’ve had some corkers. I couldn’t finish it. It was far too chewy and felt too much like a real burger. At my restaurant, I was the first to try it as it had only been launched that morning, and, boy, did I feel like a guinea pig. It is supposedly a “bleeding” burger, but which vegan or vegetarian wants to see blood coming out of a burger   Aldi Rainbow vegetable stew pound. Meat-eater: This has four of your five a day and is ready in minutes. But I found the chargrilled shyvegetables in a sugary tomato and lentil stew unsatisfactory and unpalatable. Don’t bother.

But its not just about the money for Jade, who is currently dating nine men and earning almost pound each rendezvous. She also likes the company - her favourite sugar daddy is aged .But she hasnt actually met all of them and it doesnt always involve money and gts in exchange for sex, some just want to talk. I like the intimacy and flirting that comes with it as well. It’s not a constant flow of money but it’s a constant flow of dinner, she told Whimn.

The series of operations for their separation has been dubbed “Operation Freedom” and they are being looked after by the Hungarian team of Action for Defenceless People Foundation. Rabeya and Rokayah arrived in the European country on Saturday for diagnostic and preparatory examinations needed for the final operation which plans to separate their skull.They will have special plastic surgery which involves the implantation of tissue expanders.  A spokesman for the Hungarian Action for Defenceless People Foundation said: The first step of the three-stage surgery series, the separation of the conjoined vascular system of the twins’ brains, was carried out successfully with a so-called endovascular method by Dr. Istvan Hudak, neurosurgeon, during two operations at Dhaka Medical College Department of Plastic Surgery and Neurosurgery in Bangladesh in February and August . The arrival of the twins to Hungary was preceded by serious consideration, which resulted in the conclusion that the procedure of the expander insertion must be carried out under the best conditions from the medical point of view, using the most effective tools and devices possible.  He added: The plastic surgical part of the operation is coordinated by Dr. Gergely Pataki, Hungarian plastic surgeon along with a team of plastic surgeons from Dhaka Medical College.The “major surgery” of the final separation of the brain and skull will be led by Dr. Andras Csokay PhD, neurosurgeon of the Foundation, and that must be prepared by thorough examinations.

The aim is to play football regularly with the goal of helping United reach the Premiership and hopefully secure a longer deal.#Neilson said: #Aidan is someone I know well. I paid money to take him to MK Dons and his first season was excellent.#It hasn#t worked for him under a new manager down there, but I see him as the type of creative player who can help us produce more in the final third of the park.#Another possible target is midfielder Ian Harkes, who was recently released by MLS side DC United, where he’s been a team-mate of Wayne Rooney.Harkes, , is the son of former USA international John and qualies to play in this country because he was born in England during his father’s time with Derby County.By next week they could also be joined by former Tangerines favourite Morgaro Gomis.

Until departures are confirmed, Robbie would not name names.It’s believed, though, that one of them is defender-cum-midfielder Adam Barton, while winger Yannick Loemba is another who’s not likely to be seen again in tangerine.Since Robbie took charge in October, former Jag Barton has had just  minutes of game time via two sub appearances.He’s set to move back to England where he’s spent most of his career.Loemba’s time on the pitch has been even more limited under the new boss and amounts to a four-minute appearance against Inverness in October.Like Barton, the Congolese-born Belgian passport holder only arrived in the summer.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13808455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_shr_ayp_281218weight2.jpg","title":"woman lost weight after deciding","story":"NewsWoman lost weight after deciding to do something before it was out of controlThe -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier.ShareByStephen Houston:,  JAN NewsDeborah Biggar \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHer name is a headline writer’s dream. For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"borders-top-cop-is-set-to-retire","story":"POLICE Scotlands Area Commander for the Borders, Andy McLean, is about to retire.Having joined Lothian and Borders Police in Galashiels in , Chief Inspector McLean has served in ious unorm roles over the past three decades.In his tenure, he has worked within Response and Community Policing, Road Policing and Public Order roles.Speaking ahead of his retirement Andy told us: \"It has been my absolute honour and privilege to have worked for this organisation, and for Lothian and Borders Police beforehand.\"Putting on the unorm always gave me a tremendous sense of pride and while it will be strange to no longer do this each day, I am looking forward to the next chapter and what it will involve.\"While Ive enjoyed all of my roles, being able to serve as Local Area Commander for the Borders is undoubtedly a career highlight and I am extremely grateful to all of the officers and staff Ive worked with and who have helped make our area such a wonderful place to live.\"Id also like to extend my sincerest thanks to the ious partner organisations, whom we work closely with on a daily basis.

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming.

Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails.

Not vote. Let the Tories squirm. Not our problem, mate.Its not Jeremys fault that the PM came back from Brussels with a broken-backed deal that is, in Corbyns words, ldquothe worst of all worlds. If hed been allowed to do the dealing: why, hersquod surely have come back with a joyous, jobs first Brexit. The Corbynator wouldve tough-talked Brussels into agreeing a bespoke customs union, plus privileged access to the European Single Market without any obligation to accept freedom of movement or state aid rules. Job done. If only the Tories would call that election so Jeremy could make it happen!Except of course therell be no General Election, and eventhere was, Jeremy Corbyn has about as much chance of finding a better deal in Brussels as the police have in finding drones over Gatwick, or Chris Grayling a channel ferry operator that actually has ferries. Of course, no-one is allowed to say this in the presence of the Dear Leader. So Labour ministers and MPs bite their ragged lips and perpetuate the most cynical political hood since Donald Trump promised to make Mexico pay for the border wall.And given their supine behaviour thus far, it is probable that many Labour MPs would allow themselves to be whipped into abstaining on the only meaningful vote on Brexit. After all, they abstained last year on the motion to allow parliament to consider the EEA ldquoNorway option, even though thats the one alternative to Mays deal that Brussels might accept. Their latest abstention may not be on the first outing of the ldquomeaningfulvote, scheduled for next week. May is expected to lose that , and to bring her final, final, amended deal back to the Commons, probably in February, hoping that MPs will fall into line as the Article  clock runs out. Thats when Labour will decide the fate of the nation.And lets be absolutely clear: abstaining on Brexit, the most important issue facing the UK since the Second World War, would not just be an abdication of opposition ndash it would be a betrayal, a craven capitulation, for which Labour would never be forgiven. Abstention would mean handing the future of the UK to the hardline Brexiteers who have been holding May and country to ransom for the last two years, despite representing a small minority in parliament. At the very least, Corbyn would be conniving in saving Theresa Mays discredited Withdrawal Deal, thus condemning the UK to a ldquobotched Brexit, which he described in November as ldquoan act of national self-harm.The press would have a field day with headlines about ldquoLabours Meaning-less Vote over pictures of a bewildered-looking Corbyn in Parliament as Theresa May berates him for having no policy on Brexit after two-and-a-half years of attacking the Governments. ldquoWhat is Labour for , commentators would ask, questioning Corbyns reason, leadership and his fitness to govern. But that would be nothing compared to the comments in Labour itself.Abstention would risk splitting the party. The vast majority of Labour members oppose Brexit and want a referendum. This is an issue, uniquely, which unites the young left activists of Momentum with the old right Blairites of what used to be called New Labour. There would be mass resignations, with young members burning their party cards. Rebel Labour MPs, like Chuka Umunna, would likely join with SNP, Liberal Democrats and Tory remainers, creating a new political coalition. The party could be split for years, decades even ndash like Ramsay MacDonaldrsquos Labour after .So, why is Corbyn even contemplating this ruinous route  The answer is partly his own ingrained euroscepticism. He says he voted Remain in , but ever since the s he has opposed the free market economics that underpin the  Treaty of Rome that founded the EEC. Corbyn thinks the rules of the single market could make British socialism impossible. ldquoI dont want to be told by someone , hes said, ldquothat we cant use state aid to develop industry in this country. This is disputed by Labour supporters of the EU, but it is not in doubt that Brussels generally regards Government subsidies as anti-competitive.The other reason is electoral. Most of Labourrsquos General Election target seats are pro-leave constituencies. So, while the opinion polls may indicate that a majority of voters would now vote Remain, Labour could still lose the next General Electionits seen to block Brexit. Again, this electoral calculation is disputed. But clearly Corbyn is trying to keep his pro-European party on side while not alienating anti-European voters. Riding two horses is notoriously dficult owing to the tendency to fall off both of them.But perhaps the main reason Corbyn might be tempted by abstention is the old political adage, attributed to Napoleon: ldquoNever interrupt your enemy while he is making a mistake. Brexit will be a disaster for the Tories from day one, and then get steadily worse. So, why get in her way  Let Theresa May or her successor, implement her useless Withdrawal Deal, leave the EU as planned, and then allow Labour to benefit from the public backlash. Corbyn will have his general election without ever having to have a coherent policy on Brexit, which by then will anyway be a done deal.This is a superficially attractive strategy but ultimately ruinous for Labour. First of all, this is not a battle, but a war. You DO interrupt your enemyheis about to run all over you. By abstaining, and effectively allowing Mayrsquos deal to go ahead, Labour will be fatally implicated in the subsequent disaster. The public wont forgive Corbyn for failing to seize the only opportunity to prevent Brexit. Its unlikely he would survive the backlash that will afflict our entire political class .Remain supporters in Labour hope that reason will prevail and that Corbyn will not succumb to abstentionism. That he will ldquopivot to a Peoples Vote after May loses the meaningful vote next week. But I dont think this is going to happen by itself ndash he is too wedded to keeping his head down. Anyway, Corbyns instincts are clear from his candid remarks over Christmas that, even after a General Election, he would still carry Brexit through.However, the Labour leader is supposed to believe in party democracy ndash hes been arguing for it from the backbenches for most of his career. It is now time for Labours unsilent majority to take control. Either through a special conference, demonstrations or petitions, they must show Corbyn that they will not accept Labour voting for Brexit by pretending to vote for nothing at all. The meaningful vote must mean something."},{"url":null,"title":"from-neon-gin-to-miniature-spacecraft-11-of-scotlands-coolest-brands","story":"Well say Scotland and you say the first thing that comes into your head.So who said something to do with whisky  Or golf, or posh woollen sweaters But what about neon gin, red-hot games, miniature spacecraft or a food container that could help solve the worlds plastics problem Barry Didcock knocks the cliches on their collective head and seeks out some of the coolest brands doing the coolest stuff in Scotland today ...

The Morandi Bridge fell in to a river in August, killing  people and crippling the local economy. Italy has been engulfed by a scandal over under-maintenance every since.The RAC Foundation is not saying that there are similarly dangerous structures on Scottish or UK highways. But it saiddid say the maintenance backlog did include checks on post-tensioned or PT bridges using similar technology to the Morandi.These PT bridges require intrusive inspections that can cost pound,. Almost a third of the  PT bridges managed by Britainrsquos councils have not had this test carried out in the last  years, despite requiring it.The latest study also found that some , bridges in the worst condition have been categorised as ldquosubstandard, meaning they are unable to carry the heaviest vehicles. That includes  bridges in Scotland.RAC Foundationrsquos Mr Gooding stressed that many of the these structures were old stone rural bridges, but weight restrictions came with costs.He said: ldquoAncient bridges on rural back roads might not be the highest priority for repair, but the risk we run is that substandard structures on some roads result in heavier vehicles having to make y detours.Bill Barker, secretary of SCOTS, the body that represents council road engineers, stressed that substandard bridges were not unsafe. Some  per cent of council bridges are subject to such weight restrictions and some  are scheduled to be upgraded over the next five years.Mr Barker said: ldquoThe design le of a modern bridge is  years - and many Councils have ldquoheritage structures - many of Thomas Telford bridges, built in the early s are still carrying traffic.He added: ldquoThe recent history of ever deeper cuts to Council funding will obviously have affected bridge maintenance as it has other infrastructure maintenance. However, each council will have had to make current decisions against ahistory of previous decisions. Those decisions affect current condition.Only  bridges on trunk roads managed by the Scottish Government are substandard, about one per cent of the total. Some remote highways still have stone-built crossings, such as the listed th century Aray bridge on the A near Inveraray."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9256873.jpg?type=article-full","title":"climate-for-change-helping-the-environment-one-stitch-at-a-time","story":"Stitched was launched in  by Elinor Pitt and Will Verrill, as a solution to the alarmingly high levels of waste generated by the home furnishings industry.

The process has proved how incredibly dficult it is to leave a union.\"Nicola Sturgeon is trying to weaponise Brexit, in a desperate bid to boost support for independence.\"But the majority of people in Scotland know that we are better off together, with a shared culture and history we can build our future on.\"The First Minister should take the threat of a second referendum off the table and get on with the day job of fixing our schools, hospitals and railways.\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said there was no appetite among the people of Scotland for another independence referendum.:Mark Smith: Celebrate  years of the Scottish Parliament  Yes of course, but only after wersquove fixed its central problemHe said: \"One of the experiences of Brexit has been just how dficult and painful it can be to break away from a union, even one that has been place for just  years. A union that has been in place for  years would, in my view, cause considerable economic disruption and there is no appetite from the people of Scotland for it.\"So I think the First Minister should take the earliest opportunity to rule out a second independence referendum.\"Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie added: \"The nationalists appear to have learned absolutely nothing from Brexit. Leaving a successful economic and political union leads to upheaval and uncertainty. Breaking up is hard to do.\"Wersquore only a week into  and already the First Minister is putting a isive second independence referendum ahead of fixing growing crises in health and education.ldquoNo one will be surprised to see that independence is the first priority of this SNP government, not fixing our public services."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bridge-over-the-river-tay-to-be-funded-as-part-of-350m-tay-cities-region-deal","story":"Nicola Sturgeon said pound million would be invested in the Cross Tay Link Road project - which will link the A with the A and A north of Scone.This should reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality in Perth, as well as opening up potential new sites for housing and economic development.In addition to this, a further pound million will go towards an industrial investment programme to support manufacturing businesses across the region, including Dundee, Perth, Angus and the north of Fe.The Scottish Government is committing pound million to the Tay Cities Region Deal, with the UK Government also investing pound million.Ms Sturgeon said the additional cash from her administration would \"support transport infrastructure and manufacturing projects, benefiting people and businesses and ensuring the area continues to grow and thrive\".She stated: \"As well opening up land for new housing and employment sites, the Cross Tay Link Road will reduce traffic congestion in and around Perth and improve the air quality in the city centre and Bridgend.\"The pound million industrial investment programme will help drive forward our ambitions to be a global manufacturing leader, creating opportunities for businesses right across the region.\"I am confident the Scottish Governments overall investment of pound million in the Tay Cities region will improve peoples quality of le and encourage sustainable economic growth in the Tay area and Scotland as a whole.\"Perth and Kinross Council leader Murray Lyle described the funding for the Cross Tay Link Road as \"hugely welcome\".He said: \"This project supports the exciting expansion of Perth and Kinross, opening up new housing, industrial development and job creation in the beating heart of Scotland.\"As well as being a multimillion-pound infrastructure project in itself, the road will support the growing population in the area to live le well and expand opportunities for inward investment and better connectivity across Scotland.\"Mr Lyle, speaking on behalf of the Tay Cities Deal partnership, also stated: \"This is fantastic news for the Tay cities region.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Years Honours List in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And they contain a stark warning that the policy will see the attainment gap widen.The Scottish Government insists the tests are a “key part” of its drive to improve schooling standards.MSPs will start an inquiry into the tests this week, with a separate independent investigation into the testing regime already under way after having been announced by Education Secretary John Swinney.: John Swinney hits out at Fe council for scrapping P testsThe Scottish National Standardised Assessmentswere introduced last year and see youngsters tested in literacy and numeracy in P, P, P and S. But they have proved contentious with complaints that youngsters have been left distressed and teaching unions insisting they have little educational value.Joanna Murphy of the National Parent Forum of Scotland warned: “We are now in a situation with SNSAs that is entirely unacceptable: our children’s education is being used to score political points.”And in the forum’s submission to MSPs she hit out at a “repeated lack of good, direct communication” from schools, councils and the government to parents, saying: “When there is a vacuum of information it allows fear and anxiety to spread.” The Scottish Parliament has already voted for the tests in P to be axed after all opposition parties united to defeat the SNP government on the issue. Fe Council has announced it has scrapped the tests for the youngest pupils.And although the exams provide teachers with “exceptional information”, according to Ms Murphy, the information passed on to parents was branded “meaningless”.Eileen Prior, executive director of independent parents’ group Connect said the P test is being introduced at a stage where “learning through play” is the declared focus of the teaching system.“To introduce tests at this stage is to act completely counter to the purpose of this approach,” she said.The tests are a multiple choice exercise carried out online and delivered by the Australian Council for Educational Research International United Kingdom . Acer UK’s director of assessment and reporting, Juliette Mendelovits, will appear before MSPs this week. The same assessment is supposed to take place in every state school in Scotland, though teachers decide when to do them. They do not take place under exam conditions and ministers have said they should happen in “an informal and relaxed way”.Ms Sturgeon has pledged to drive down the gap in performance between schools in affluent parts of Scotland and less well-off areas and in a keynote speech in  called on Scots to judge her on this.But children’s organisation Upstart Scotland warned that the pressure of the P tests could exacerbate mental health problems, particularly in disadvantaged pupils. The body states in a submission: “It is therefore improbable that the introduction of SNSA will help close the poverty-related attainment gap – indeed, it is ore likely to widen it.”It added: “The First Minister’s call to be judged on her record in education means that SNSA is recognised by the public and media as a key factor of a high-stakes policy. As such, it puts considerable pressure on local authorities, schools and teachers.”Children in Scotland added that the assessments “appear to present a pathway to high stakes testing” and questioned their “validity and reliability”.But a submission from the Scottish Government insisted that the tests provide a “valid assessment” of children’s literacy and numeracy in line with Scotland’s Curriculum for Excellence.It adds that the “positive impact” of the assessments on learning and teaching is “clearly demonstrated” in a series of case studies published by ministers in October, and said: “The information can also help redirect learning and support teachers in looking at how certain groupings might be working.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850066.1546196471!/image/image.jpg","title":"survey finds st kilda sea caves in good condition","story":"Researchers have captured #stunning# images of marine le in the waters around St Kilda as a survey revealed its reefs and sea caves are in good condition.Scottish Natural Heritagehas just published the findings of the wide-reaching survey which was carried out in  by a team of ers.Home to nearly one million seabirds, the St Kilda archipelago is the UK’s only dual Unesco World Heritage Site for both its natural and cultural signicance.It was evacuated on August ,  after the remaining  islanders voted to leave as their way of le was no longer sustainable.The survey aimed to judge the current condition of the sea caves in the archipelago, which is situated around  miles west of the outer Hebrides and, in North Rona, north-west of Cape Wrath.The team of researchers concluded that the site was in “good condition”.The researchers also discovered a new species of soft coralwithin one of the St Kilda caves.SNH said that St Kilda hosts huge seabird populations, including the world’s second largest colony of North Atlantic gannets.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4851946.1546682355!/image/image.jpg","title":"interview rising star jade anouka on her new tv drama cleaning up","story":"After a decade, Jade Anouka is finally making her living through acting alone, with breakthrough roles on stage, TV and film, including new drama Cleaning Up.Numbers, numbers, numbers, I’m not a numbers person,” says the actor and poet Jade Anouka and laughs. “It’s funny because everyone  in my family is about numbers – my mum’s a maths teacher, and my dad was a financial adviser. They’re all numbers, my lot. I’m a complete anomaly. I’m a words person.”Shakespeare, poetry, Ted Talks, and over the phone too she’s a wizard wordsmith, but ask her about insider trading, stocks and shares and hedge funds and she’s stymied. No matter because what she CAN do is act, and it all adds up in her latest role in ITV’s Cleaning Up, in which she stars opposite Sheridan Smith as a pair of down-on-their-luck cleaners who find an ingenious,illegal, way of playing the system. The result is a darkly amusing tale of have-nots at the bottom of the social pile fighting back, using the same methods as the have-it-alls they clean up after in Canary Wharf, a tale about modern Britain with zero hours contracts and with strong female leads. Cleaning Up, written by newcomer Mark Marlow, and directed by Lewis Arnold Humans, Broadchurch, Misfits, Banana centres on the friendship between Anouka’s character Jess and Sam, played by Sheridan Smith. The actors hit it off at the audition, lending an ease and authenticity to their performances.“Sam and Jess have grown up together and Jess is the voice of reason, someone who thinks before she does, which Sam doesn’t, so they’re a good match. Jess tries to keep her out of trouble.”It’s not easy to stay out of trouble when you’re hard up and the pair are tempted to take a gamble, much like the financiers in the shiny offices the invisible army cleans overnight. “It’s about who deserves to get away with stuff,” says Anouka. “Being the underdog you feel you’ve got to look out for yourself andyou’re living hand to mouth, one mistake has massive repercussions. Seeing people get away with it, you’d feel like, ‘why shouldn’t I ’” “It puts the spotlight on the everyday people, the ones working hard to pay their bills, not living the high le, which is most of the country. It’s good to see people like that fighting back.”“I think a lot of people will just love Cleaning Up. When I watched it I was thinking about all the people I know and thinking ‘my dad will love this’ and that it really is one of those shows you will sit down and watch with your family, it’s brilliant.”Anouka is no stranger to cleaning up from when she worked in pubs and cafes to supplement her acting income, starting out. Last year was the first she’s made a living through acting alone.“When I was starting out there were times when I had three jobs. If I wasn’t auditioning or learning lines I was always working. I would wake up and go shoe shining, then in the afternoon work in a pub or cafe, then in the evening in a call centre, so it’s quite full on. There’s no chill time. That’s what you see in Cleaning Up, that these characters are always working and never get to relax.”Surprisingly, the bar work or call centre jobs are not the ones that come to mind when Anouka recalls her worst ever job.“Oh God, I was a children’s entertainer when I was at drama school,” she says, still scarred. “I did parties and face painting and that was fine, but it was before I had satnav on my phone and I’d get completely lost trying to find the houses so I’d be late. And I’d look ridiculous, in a yellow car carrying a red suitcase wearing green dungarees or a tutu and having to run into petrol stations to ask directions. Then turning up in tears because I was late and ruining their day.” The children’s “No, the parents, oh my god. The children don’t care, they don’t know you’re late. They were all fine. But the parents were so stressed, and I just wanted to burst into tears but you can’t come in dressed as a clown and cry. It was so stressful I had to stop.” Anouka has been making a name for herself on stage and screen, with the airing of last year’s psychological thriller Trauma, for ITV, with John Simm and Adrian Lester and The Donmar Warehouse’s All-Female Shakespeare Trilogy in , as well as cult hit Chewing Gum in .This last year has been busy for the  Screen International Star of Tomorrow, working on three productions, two theatre and one film. She took the lead as Queen Margaret at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, a composite of Shakespeare’s lines for Margaret of Anjou, a character he gave more words than any other, including Cleopatra and Rosalind, across four history plays. This production saw Anouka reassert Margaret as warrior queen, cutting a swathe through patriarchal power struggles in a re-telling of the Wars of the Roses, and at the same time waging a contemporary war on the historic gender imbalance in Shakespeare performance. Earlier last year she went forward in time to a dystopian world where blood quality can decide your credit rating in The Phlebotomist, and as well as Cleaning Up, she made the film, Fisherman’s Friends. Starring Tuppence Middleton and James Purefoy, it’s a feelgood tale of Cornish fisherman who land a record deal singing sea shanties, due out in March. She’s a familiar face north of the Border too, having won a Fringe First for her one-woman show Chef at the Traverse in  and the film of Donmar Warehouse’s Julius Caesar was up for best feature at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. “Incredible,” says Anouka, “considering it’s a live theatre recording. But Phyllida [Lloyd, the director], is also a film director so she knows what she’s doing. It’s quite special.”Born and raised in Greater London, Anouka is the middle of three children to a Jamaican father and Trinidadian mother. An athlete, she ran for Kent but got the acting bug at school and won a scholarship to the National Youth Theatre while at sixth form college in Lewisham.“Everyone there was going ‘yeah, I’m gonna be an actor, I’m going to drama school’ and I was ‘going to drama school  What’s going on ‘ere ’ Then after that I was like, “Oh, OK, I’m going to do this, it isn’t just a hobby, this is what I want to do.’” Guildford School of Acting followed and from there to the RSC, making her debut in  in Margaret Atwood’s Penelopiad. More theatre followed then TV with parts in Lucky Man and Doctor Who, before she landed the role in Trauma, ITV’S follow up to Doctor Foster, requiring her to learn how to rock climb. On stage, the Donmar Warehouse set her star rising too. Set in a women’s prison, the Trilogy of Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest, prompted Lloyd to hire an all-female ensemble cast of all ethnicities and ages to re-invigorate the Bard. Within a decade from first working in theatre Anouka was playing traditional male leads Hotspur, Ariel and Marc Anthony delivering the “Friends, Romans, countrymen…” speech.“It’s funny because I never liked Shakespeare when I was younger,” she says. ”But when I left drama school I got an interview with the RSC, ended up being there for two years and fell in love with it. And Shakespeare was where people started doing colour-blind casting. Everyone does Shakespeare at some point in this country and we need to look at why those plays should still be done, why they are relevant. So many seem quite modern in their themes – in a scary way I guess it’s history repeating itself.”She might be a words woman but Anouka likes a piece of the action too, and she played Hotspur as a kickboxer, preparing for the part by studying videos of Olympic boxing champion Nicola Adams, and training hard. “I grew up watching boxing with my dad, but they were big heavyweight guys, so I watched Nicola Adams, hours and hours of videos, how she trained. She even copied the Muhammad Ali shuffle. It was great fun, a great way to keep fit and I’d like to do it again. But I never sparred, not that, no-one’s coming near my face!” She laughs.Anouka writes and performs her own poetry, some of it published in her collection Eggs on Toast, and admits to sometimes finding it easier to express herself through poetry than through acting. She would love to combine theatre and poetry, her two loves, into a lyrical theatre piece, at the same time as popularising poetry by making it ‘less stuffy’. “With acting I find it often much harder to express what you want to say because you have less control over what’s going on. I started writing poetry a long time ago because I could use it to have my own voice, whereas in acting, obviously you try to take work that you think is good and represents you, but you don’t always have that luxury. So poetry is a way of being creative and having an outlet when you are not working in something that’s creatively interesting or fulfilling. And between jobs, I always have to do something that’s creative.”It was to her poetry she turned when she was invited to do a Ted Talk last year, reciting a poem she wrote that was inspired by Maya Angelou.“I’ve always thought of Ted Talks as being very intellectual, where you have to have a great invention or know about a particular topic so I wasn’t sure whether I deserved to be doing it or what I should do, but I thought what an honour! And I decided to speak from my experience, so it was ‘Being Black, being a Woman, being ‘Other’ and hopefully that strikes a chord with others, everyone who has felt Other.” And it felt natural to put poetry in there.” Anouka went on to talk about her crowdfunding a screening of Black Panther, the  black superhero film now tipped for an Oscar, for kids in her local area of Peckham because she thought it was an important film for them to see, a film that reflected the ‘other’ and underscored the belief that everyone was entitled to fulfilment and a voice no matter their creed, sexuality, culture or gender. “I couldn’t believe how much we raised. So much more than I expected that I’ve got a bit of money left over. We extended the screening so many more kids got to see it and I’ve given money to charities who work with young people, but I really want to do another film screening. That film was such a special thing, so it’s hard to know what the next film to do that for would be. But I’ll definitely do it again.” As for ersity, Anouka feels inspired by the changes she sees in the acting world, citing Sophie Okonedo, who recently won an Evening Standard Best Actress Award for her performance with Ralph Fiennes in Antony and Cleopatra. “She works in film, TV and theatre, which is a dream of mine. And she was in Undercover with Adrian Lester, who is a legend.”It was Lester who presented Anouka with the Ian Charleston Commendation Award for Shakespeare for Under s and having followed his career ever since, she was delighted to play his daughter in Trauma.“I think things are changing, definitely on stage particularly, it’s going in the right direction, but you can always do more. I think theatre is ahead of TV and film in this country, but I see it improving and more exciting stuff coming out.” “Queen Margaret was an example of that. Rather than just re-telling Shakespeare, it changed the lens we’re looking through, so it was all through Queen Margaret’s eyes.”Having played three of Shakespeare’s great male roles Anouka would love to take on more. “God there are so many. Loads of good ones!” she says and laughs. “I’d do LOADS of them! I’ve said before I’ve wanted to play Hamlet. Obviously it was written as a male role, but I see the character, not as a male character, but as a young adult, not quite knowing how to deal with grief and finding out about relationships, romance, all of these things coming in at once. It very much feels like showing somebody turning into an adult, and it’s something I would love to do before I get too old.”Anouka doesn’t talk about her age in a bid not to be tied down to age specic roles, witness her convincing teenager in Trauma. Similarly, she doesn’t talk about who she shares her south-east London flat or le with, apart from rescue dog Evie, who is possibly half Yorkie half Bichon Frise, “I’ve never seen another dog like her, so we’re waiting for a DNA test, just to see,” she laughs.As someone who has been in Doctor Who twice, Anouka has nothing but praise for Jodie Whittaker’s take on the Time Lord. “I wasn’t the right age for it when it came back – it was my little sister that watched it, but then I was in it and I thought gosh, it’s brilliant, are they all like this  And it’s not just brilliant entertainment, but important to watch, like the Rosa Parks episode. School children should all have to watch that episode, it was a great history lesson.”“And it’s important when you’re growing up to see things reflecting of your le, someone who maybe looks a bit like you, and more and more we need someone to do exactly this, be bold like Doctor Who and then the impact is going to be enormous. You realise how little it happens, because when it does, you see the impact. Cleaning Up’s like that, full of women leads, and you just don’t see that.” Next up, Anouka is in the new Idris Elba comedy, Turn Up Charlie, a series of eight half hour episodes for Netflix. She plays a DJ who is an arch rival to Elba’s character, a failing DJ working as a nanny to an out of control -year-old. “It’s nice to be doing comedy. Cleaning Up has humour in it but it’s lighthearted and heartwarming and sometimes dark, rather than actively trying to make you laugh. But this is more of a comedy and it’s out next year, so that’ll be good. Often people don’t think of me for comedy because I’ve done a lot of Shakespeare on stage and stuff, but I like it. I’d like to do more.” And since she’s as much about words as action, we’ll give the final one to Anouka and the call to action with which she ended her Ted Talk and summed up her attitude to inclusivity and embracing the Other in all of us: “When you get that chance, that opportunity, that seat at the table, get creative. And remember to pull up another seat for the next person.” @JanetChristieCleaning Up begins on Wednesday \u2028 January, ITV, pm©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852459.1546847127!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith deepening division over brexit can t become the new norm","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A new paper offers a path out of the Brexit swamp, so the issues that really affect people can be addressed, writes Brian MonteithLast week Gary Lineker made a fool of himself. He sent out a tweet picturing a supposedly official warning of an NHS in crisis with medicine and prescription shortagesthere is a no-deal Brexit. The Department of Health had to correct his misleading tweet with an official and direct response saying: “This is not an official NHS leaflet. People should trust advice from official NHS sources. We are confident thateveryone does what they need to do, medical supplies will be uninterrupted and patients will get their prescriptions as normal.”In addition Health Secretary Matthew Hancock had to issue a video providing reassurance there would be no shortages. Lineker had to take down the misleading tweet.: Brexit defeat in Commons could lead to second referendum on EUBefore then, in an even more ignorant and egregious act, the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford eroded any remaining respect opponents might have had for him by retweeting a comparison of the treatment of foreign residents following Brexit with the Holocaust. Despite being condemned by relatives of Holocaust survivors for his gross misjudgment that both belittled the crime and demonstrated a lack of awareness that the SNP’s White Paper on independence advocated removing residency rights from EU nationals in Scotland, there was no apology nor a retraction.It is bad enough for elected representatives to focus almost entirely on Brexit when there is so much in society requiring reform and improvement, but it is an especially sad reflection of our current political discourse that celebrities feel the need to ape our politicians who, after all, the public ranks as being among the least trusted and honourable of professions.The truth is – and we can all see it but few are willing to admit it – this Government’s cursed and botched Brexit process has, like the domination of the independence issue in Scotland before it, sucked most of the oxygen from policy debate and dominated column inches in all forms of media communication. Educational standards are being corrupted health and social care is well down the road to a cruel financial reckoning and a sense of disharmony and injustice is growing. Yet while these are real issues that affect people and can change for the worse inidual le chances, the priority of both the Government and opposition parties is Brexit. Even for the SNP, Brexit is the means to keep independence on le support.If one were to stop and ask any person in the street what particular action the UK Government is taking to improve the lives of its people, I wager that practically all, say at least  per cent, would struggle to offer an example of a policy. Nor do the opposition parties offer any comfort. Were members of the public to be asked what Labour or the rest are specically offering – beyond just doing the opposite of the Government – I again believe there would be general incomprehension. This might explain why, in the latest polling from YouGov, with Theresa May’s Government in disarray and Conservative MPs ided beyond what anyone living can remember, Labour has still fallen back five points to only  per cent while the Conservatives are at  per cent.How do we get back to normal – or is this deepening binary ision the new normal for a long time yet  One thing is certain: the Withdrawal Agreement will simply preserve the negotiating stasis as there is no incentive to settle anything until near the end of the transition period. This will only continue the growing mood of economic uncertainty for at least two more years – and in that way risk the recession that its advocates say they wish to avoid. It will maintain the growing polarisation of people across the land where nearly every conversation with friends and family tends towards Brexit and the impotence of political parties to bring about much needed change in society’s institutions is guaranteed.Fortunately the former trade secretary Peter Lilley and Labour Future leader Brendan Chilton publish today a paper entitled  Truths About Leaving on WTO Terms that, one by one, deconstructs the myths of departing the EU without a deal. Naturally it demonstrates how we could keep our £ billion to deal with our own problems, be free to create our own laws from day one, not be held back about making trade deals with China, the US or India and need not worry about availability of medicines, international flights or chocolate for Easter eggs . Notwithstanding all these and many other truths, possibly the strongest to recommend itself is thatwe commit to leaving and living with a World Trade Organisation deal then we can deliver to ourselves something we should all cherish – the debate will be over, we can move on, we canto normal.If May’s deal passes we commit the country to at least two more years of building up ision in our society. If after then there is still no deal acceptable to either partywe will be caught in an interminable maze we can wander around but never escape from.If we leave and make good of the WTO terms of trade – and the accompanying micro-deals on aviation, higher education, scientic research, citizenship of expatriates and the like – we canto fixing our outdated democratic institutions to mending our roads, rail and infrastructure to healing our health and social care systems and ing standards of discipline and learning to our schools. Yes, we shall still have to negotiate a trade deal but we shall have left and the whole issue will move from being dominant to a dull backwater compared with our real societal problems.Businesses, knowing again what they have to deal with, can make plans for trading under WTO rules and begin to make investment decisions. We might avoid an economic recession that in the cycle is now overdue and that two more years of negotiating paralysis and indecision about our future must only make more certain than all the scaremongering we have endured about Brexit.We might even see again the day when Lineker keeps his views about politics to himself and opines instead on football and sport. As for Blackford, with the sting of Brexit drawn, he can look forward to being a crofter again in a more harmonious United Kingdom.l Brian Monteith is a director of Global Britain©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852565.1546853225!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon brexit strengthens case for scottish independence","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The case for Scottish independence has been #materially strengthened# by Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon has claimed as the UK government battles to save the Prime Minister#s deal with the EU.The First Minister said she hoped to be able to unveil her timetable for a second independence referendum “very soon”, renewing speculation that she will issue a demand for a fresh vote on Scotland’s future in the weeks ahead.And she attacked Jeremy Corbyn for refusing to embrace another referendum on Brexit, calling on the Labour leader to “get off the fence”.Her comments came as MPs ed to Westminster following the Christmas break with little sign of progress in convincing Conservative rebels to back Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Opposition parties rallied behind a plan to make delivery of a no-deal Brexit impossible by amending key financial legislation, in a bid to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without an agreement.Meanwhile, critics blasted a test of plans to deal with gridlock around the UK’s Channel ports in the event of no-deal as a farce, after the government gathered half the number of lorries it said it needed for the exercise at an airfield in Kent.Speaking to the BBC, Ms Sturgeon claimed Scotland’s interests were being “completely ignored and sidelined” and that what has happened in the past two years has reinforced the case for it to leave the UK.Ms Sturgeon would not be drawn on timings around an independence referendum, but insisted the SNP had a mandate to call an independence referendum before the next Holyrood election.: Playing a waiting game on IndyRef is dangerous for SNP“Everything that has happened over the past couple of years, from Scotland facing exit from the EU against our will to every reasonable attempt at compromise to protect Scotland’s interests by the Scottish Government being spurned, to the powers of the Scottish Parliament being eroded, to the UK government even taking the Scottish Government to court, all of that has strengthened and reinforced the case for Scotland to be independent, because these are not just academic arguments, all of this will have a material impact on Scotland’s economy and well-being for ­decades to come,” Ms Sturgeon said. “The case for independence is materially strengthened from an already strong base in  because of all of the experience of Scotland in the last two years. We were told in  that it was voting for independence that would put in peril our membership of the European Union.“Because we didn’t vote for independence, we now not just find ourselves facing exit, the voice and the interests of Scotland are being completely ignored and sidelined.”Ms Sturgeon said there is “clearly no majority” to crash out of the EU without a deal and that holding another referendum on Brexit should be the alternative.She said: “I hope the meaningful vote does go ahead next week so that MPs can once and for all say that they don’t support the Withdrawal Agreement, and then the House of Commons can coalesce behind the alternative, and in my view that alternative now should be to have another EU referendum. I don’t take for granted that there is a majority for that, but the SNP will be part of building that majority.”Turning her fire on the Labour leader, Ms Sturgeon added: “I think there’s a big question for Jeremy Corbyn now: is he going to get off the fence and actually do what the majority of his own party members want him to do, which is back a second referendum ”Mrs May’s official spokesman accused the First Minister of “sowing the politics of ision” and said the Prime Minister was focused on delivering her Brexit deal.Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw called on the SNP leader to abandon her “obsession” with independence.“Today Scots are heading back to work at the beginning of a new year, but Nicola Sturgeon is stuck in the past,” Mr Carlaw said. “As at the start of , , , and  her priority is to rerun the referendum of . People across the country will correctly be thinking, ‘There she goes again’.“The best new year’s resolution the SNP could make would be to drop the independence obsession and concentrate on delivering for the people of Scotland.”Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said “one of the experiences of Brexit has been just how dficult and painful it can be to break away from a union, even one that has been place for just  years”.Mr Leonard added: “A union that has been in place for  years would, in my view, cause considerable economic disruption and there is no appetite from the people of Scotland for it.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie claimed the SNP “appear to have learned absolutely nothing from Brexit”, adding: “Breaking up is hard to do.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852898.1546877790!/image/image.jpg","title":"city deal cash to fund new bridge over river tay says nicola sturgeon","story":"A new bridge over the River Tay and other road improvements will be funded as part of the area#s city region deal, the First Minister has announced.Nicola Sturgeon said £ million would be invested in the Cross Tay Link Road project - which will link the A with the A and A north of Scone.This should reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality in Perth, as well as opening up potential new sites for housing and economic development.In addition to this, a further £ million will go towards an industrial investment programme to support manufacturing businesses across the region, including Dundee, Perth, Angus and the north of Fe.The Scottish Government is committing £ million to the Tay Cities Region Deal, with the UK Government also investing £ million.Ms Sturgeon said the additional cash from her administration would “support transport infrastructure and manufacturing projects, benefiting people and businesses and ensuring the area continues to grow and thrive”.• : Pressure on Westminster over Tay Cities Region DealShe stated: “As well opening up land for new housing and employment sites, the Cross Tay Link Road will reduce traffic congestion in and around Perth and improve the air quality in the city centre and Bridgend.“The £ million industrial investment programme will help drive forward our ambitions to be a global manufacturing leader, creating opportunities for businesses right across the region.“I am confident the Scottish Government’s overall investment of £ million in the Tay Cities region will improve people’s quality of le and encourage sustainable economic growth in the Tay area and Scotland as a whole.”Perth and Kinross Council leader Murray Lyle described the funding for the Cross Tay Link Road as “hugely welcome”.He said: “This project supports the exciting expansion of Perth and Kinross, opening up new housing, industrial development and job creation in the beating heart of Scotland.• : Tension between Holyrood and Westminster hit City Deals impact“As well as being a multimillion-pound infrastructure project in itself, the road will support the growing population in the area to live le well and expand opportunities for inward investment and better connectivity across Scotland.”Mr Lyle, speaking on behalf of the Tay Cities Deal partnership, also stated: “This is fantastic news for the Tay cities region.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours.

Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonIt is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.Peoples Democracyemerged as one of the constituent parts of the wider Civil Rights Movementin the north of Ireland during the late s.It was a collective of radical students influenced like the rest of the emergent CRM by global events and motivated by a resolve to bring an end to the injustices of the then unionist state.Inspired by the political example of the Selma to Montgomery march organised by the American CRM, the PD and notably without the approval of the wider CRM, decided to march from Belfast to Derry in a highly symbolic protest against the denial of democratic and civil rights in the north.The march began on st January and eventually arrived in Derry on Saturday th January .  But, not before it was violently confronted by unionist extremists, supported by members of the B-Specials state militia, as it passed through Antrim town and Randalstown in South Antrim, and then most notoriously at Burntollet Bridge, outside Claudy and finally again at Irish Street in Derry, before finally arriving at the citys Guildhall.and Brackareilly, near Maghera.Where the route of the march was blocked by unionists, local people provided transport to the next clear point on the journey.Among the numbers to join and support the marchers as it passed through South Antrim and South Derry were local republicans, including IRA volunteers and members of the then Republican Clubs local Hibernians, social democrats, as well as other progressive minded people, who recognised the importance of the march, and respected those participating. The Long March to Derry as it came to be known made its own historic contribution to the demise of the old unionist regime in the north of Ireland.So to mark this landmark event, fty years on from the actual date of the ambush on the marchers at Burntollet, Sinn Féin in my South Antrim constituency organised an evening of reminiscence and political discussion, compered by the author and Sinn Féins former Director of Publicity, Danny Morrison.A specially produced video by Noel and Noel Óg Maguire was shown, sharing local peoples eye witness accounts and recollections of what happened in Antrim, Randalstown, Toome, and also at Burntollet.Civil rights veterans, and former Sinn Féin MLAs, Mary Nelis and Mitchel Mc Laughlin, and myself then participated in a  discussion.That reviewed the pre-civil rights period, how the CRM came into existence, and how the civil rights era gave way to the political conflict, leading up to the peace process, and the present day political situation.It was an excellent event, with an audience spanning three or four generations from South Antrim and South Derry.Some present were reconnecting with historical events which they helped shape, and which in turn shaped them: others were of an age to draw parallels between their own contemporary experiences of rights denied today with the denial of rights fty years ago.What the Long March to Derry in , and the sequence of other events of that same year, climaxing with the pogroms of August , brought sharply into focus was that partition remained the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society: and, that the denial of civil rights in the north was, and remains inisible from the denial of Irish national independence. Following the RUC assault on the civil rights marchers in Duke Street, Derry, on th October , the Long March to Derry again exposed for a world audience the institutionalised sectrarianism of the northern state, and extent of unionist opposition to the equality and rights agenda.Nothing would ever be the same again.It took a further thirty years before the Good Friday Agreementdrew a line under the use of political violence provided the political architecture of the Irish peace process and, established in legislation equality and human rights for all citizens in many ways the GFA addressed what the CRM did not resolve.It gave expression with an internationally binding treaty to the crux of the CRM agenda, by establishing the bench marks of equality, rights, and respect for all citizens.It became our societys road map away from the legacy of political violence towards the achievement of a rights based society, with parity of esteem, mutual respect and anti-sectarianism, at its core.Both the British and Irish governments have failed to fully implement the GFA.Just as the unionist state in  opposed the CRM, signicant sections of political unionism have pushed back against the GFA since .It is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,  a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.And, that is the fundamental reason why the democratic political institutions in the north remain suspended and why the GFA faces its greatest ever threat.Make no mistake, there is a deep systemic crisis in the north of Ireland.Now that crisis is deepening with the onset of the Brexit catastrophe.Brexit has swept away all of the previously established assumptions about the constitutional, political and economic status quo in Ireland north and south.A solution to the depth of this crisis will only be found through negotiation and decisive political leadership, which commands the authority to make and keep agreements, and embrace and deliver change.Those who marched from Belfast to Derry fty years ago this week were a microcosm of the wider CRM.They were students and others, including, republicans, social democrats, communists, socialists, trade unionists, and labour members. They were from dferent religious back grounds, and none.The timeless lesson of the CRM which applies to our current situation is that the type of progressive alliances which stood up for rights in  are still required today in .We need progressive and democratic alliances to defend the GFA to stand up against the scourge of Brexit to achieve a Bill of Rights and, secure the fundamental language, legacy, marriage, and womens health rights which are enjoyed where in Ireland and Britain.The British and Irish governments should not make the mistake of underestimating the momentum for change which exists, or the expectations of nationalist and other sections of progressive opinion.We have come full circle. The extremists within political unionism must not be allowed to hold back change.The days of second class citizenship are over.The post civil rights generations will never again be pushed to the back of the bus.Fundamental change in relations between Ireland and Britain is now unavoidable.Importantly, progressive and democratic alliances will also be required to persuade and convince a majority as to the desirability and achievability of an agreed, constitutional Irish national democracy, which guarantees a future for all our people based upon rights, respect and reconciliation.A year of new challenges lies ahead in .Those aspiring for maximum change must remain focussed upon the bigger picture. There can be room for complacency. The momentum for change must not relax. needs to be a year of more and louder voices, greater advocacy, and increased popular mobilisation for democratic rights and change.Let us all ensure that  echoes to the clarion call of those iconic words...We shall overcome.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1367796.jpg--.jpg?1546593860000\n","title":"closure of ballymena firm leads to job losses","story":"Ballymena based, JBE Mechanical.Electrical Ltd, has today gone into Administration.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

We were found wanting and the players know that.#The only thing I will take from that is that it had reinforced in my own mind some of the players who are stepping up and others we will have to review.#Antrim actually hit the first point of the game through Paddy McBride in the opening minute, but they were to be swamped at the other end with the points flowing for Armagh before a stray Colm Fleming kick-out gave Ryan McShane a gt of a goal to move Armagh - to - ahead on  minutes.Their second major arrived a minute later, this time from a Jamie Clarke penalty after another stray pass resulted in Rory Grugan being hauled back in the area.By the time McBride added to the Antrim tally on  minutes, the game was gone as Clarke and man-of-the-match Stefan Campbell caused havoc at the other end with Armagh leading - to - at the half.McGeeney#s charges did appear to take their foot off the gas a little in the second half, but it was hard to blame them as the game became rather pedestrian.Credit to the hosts who kept plugging away with Niall Delargy and McBride leading the way in attack and they did grab a consolation goal through Eoghan McCabe with the last act of the game, but this was a rare blemish for Armagh who were worthy winners.“It’s the old adage of goals win games and once you concede two in three minutes it#s massive,” Harbinson added.“Armagh#s tackling was very good too and I thought maybe in the second half we were blown up for some easier stuff, but that#s the inconsistencies.“Armagh showed the desire of getting men forward and breaking lines, but we were just a bit slow in doing that.“It#s disappointing because the boys are working really hard and we know they are. We made eight changes from last week against Monaghan because we#re using the McKenna Cup to look at players, although some were enforced on us through injury. When you make all those changes, you run the risk against a very good team of being exposed and that#s what#s happened.”ANTRIM: C Fleming P Brannigan, R Johnston, A Sweeney P Finnegan, D Lynch, P Gallagher M Sweeney, E Walsh M McCarry, M Fitzpatrick, C DuffinK Quinn , E McCabe , P McBride .

Or, more accurately, David Stitt BSc Hons is on Twitter. Arlene Foster’s erstwhile photo companion has been busying himself of late on the Kilcooley bonfire in Bangor, which he’s determined to ensure is the biggest and the best in Are Wee Country.First up, Squinter’s not sure what Science Dee is a Bachelor of Honours in – the UDA man doesn’t say. But from the tweets about the appliance of structural engineering science to the massive edice, it might appear that it is in that field of endeavour that he excelled at university. We might be tempted to speculate on what university handed the qualication over to him, given the quality of the spelling on his Twitter account, but let’s stick to the matter in hand.On Thursday, as the bonfire crept out of the North Down troposphere and into the stratosphere, Dee gave vent to the vaunting pride that’s filling his barrel chest as the race for the title of Biggest Boney came down to the final furlong: “Kilcooley Bonfire, Well on its way to be Ulster Biggest . A Military Operation, being constructed by Structural Engineers for safety.” Across the Pravince, men of substance nodded slowly and gravely and gave thanks that the health and safety of the children of the large estate is in such professional hands. Next day the Kilcooley boney fell down.AUGUSTAN open letter from Emma Little Pengelly, DUP South Belfast MP, on the Glidergate scandal#Thank you for giving me space in your paper to lay out my position on the Woodstock Road Glider stop, erroneously referred to by some as the ‘Short Strand’ Glider stop, among them the people who designed and built the Glider system and the people closest to it.It has been alleged that I have never before shown an interest in bus stops.. Nothing could be further from the truth. At university I was a founder member of the ‘Campaign to Save Ulster Bus Stops’ and I wrote a very well-received pamphlet which I distributed to membersentitled ‘Classic Bus Stops of Markethill and Richhill – Ulster’s Hidden History’. Furthermore, I have on occasion been on a bus, although admittedly not for a while. That the Glider stop I referred to is near the Short Strand is not in question, but since when did geographical proximity have anything to do with naming things  The Donegal Celtic football club on the Suffolk Road is not in Donegal. The Dublin Road is not in Dublin. Even the Woodstock Road is not in Woodstock, which most people are unaware of . So calling the stop Short Strand because it is near the Short Strand makes zero sense and is in fact potentially confusing. What is this place coming to when routes can’t be changed or amended just because they are traditional  SEPTEMBERSCOTLAND’S Shame, it’s called – the ,lb gorilla in the Holyrood Parliament that nobody wants to speak about. Many and frequent are the manestations of anti-Catholic sentiment at the very core of Scottish society, but the antics this week of a senior Labour Party official at the party conference in Liverpool has seen the issue reach a wider audience and that may make it rather more dficult for it to remain a dirty secret. Speaking from the , Scotsman Andy Kerr, Chairman of the Labour Party’s ruling National Executive Committee, invited a woman to speak and then added: “Did you cross yourself there  In that case I might not.” Not surprisingly, the ‘joke’ went down like a fart in a space suit as Andy obviously forgot that he wasn’t speaking before a select audience in Glasgow. The apology wasn’t long coming “unreservedly” with Andy adding: “I was trying to be lighthearted but what I said was ill-judged and wrong.” Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: “People from all parties and none will be appalled by this and by the casual dismissal of concerns.” Much as Squinter cheered Ruth’s decisive intervention, he must reluctantly point out that her party has blotted its copybook in the recent past when it comes to the matter of Catholics in Scotland. Last year a Conservative member of Stirling Council was readmitted to the party after being suspended for posting anti-Catholic comments online. Alastair Majury tweeted: “Why is the Catholic Church against birth control  Because they#ll run out of children to molest.”Of course, had Andy Kerr made a religiously loaded remark like the one he did about Catholics about, say, Muslims, or Jews, he wouldn’t have seen the end of the day. But in situ he remains, at the very heart of a party currently struggling with allegations of anti-Semitism which so far have not been solid enough to see any heads roll. The Zionist lobby which is after Jeremy Corbyn’s head would surely have claimed their first victory had this remark been aimed in the direction of Judaism. Perhaps you’ll remember that in July the Orange Order called off a parade in Glasgow. They called it off rather than obey a direction not to walk past a Catholic church where at a previous Orange Order march a priest had been spat at and struck with a baton by parade followers. Now the socialists have joined the KKK. Jings, crivvens, help m’boab!OCTOBERWHAT IS THE BACKSTOP The factsAn insurance policydesigned to avoid a hard border in the event that a customs agreement cannot be agreed by the end of the transition period . If no agreement is reached, the EU wants to see the north remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union until London comes up with a solution. Under pressure from hardliners, British Prime Minister Theresa May wants the backstop done away with or, at the very least, subject to a time limit.The loyal Ulster factsKeeping the Pravince in the Single Market and Customs Union while the rest of the UK leaves is an existential threat to the future of Are Wee Country and the DUP is battling to “save the union”. The party is clear that there can be no ergence within the UK, except on things that it wants to erge on, gyeh morrage and abortion, for instance. A DUP source has promised to up the pressure on the Tory government: “We are going to squeeze their balls until their ears bleed.”Promises, promises# NOVEMBERWhich brings us to James McClean. Again. Since last year’s Remembrance Day festival the Derry native and Republic of Ireland international has switched clubs from West Brom to Stoke. In order to keep their fans informed ahead of the annual wearing of the poppy football shirts across the English leagues, the club issued a brief statement outlining the player’s historical stance and confirming that he wouldn’t be sporting a poppy on his shirt this year either.Despite the fact that nothing had changed – other than the name of the club at the top of the press release – the statement sent the Pravince’s media to DefCon , just as it has since the day and hour James spoke his first words on the topic, occasioning the familiar angry social media blast from Ulster’s stout yeomanry. There’s a delicious and very fitting circularity in this local saga:just as nothing has changed in relation to James McClean and the poppy, nothing has changed in Ulster’s attitude to it.DECEMBERA BURNING question finally gets its answer. No, it’s not about Brexit, or world hunger, or famine or plague. It’s simply this: what do you call this item pictured below left  You may never have given the matter any thought, but Squinter has, because, well# because that’s the kind of guy he is. Fact of the matter is that you’re very unlikely ever to ask for one because  out of every thousand of these things sold are simply lted by the customer and brought to the counter or check-out without a word. If you have a shopping list it will simply say ‘milk’ and everyone knows exactly how large or how small their milk requirements are.But every time Squinter buys one he asks himself why he doesn’t have a clue what it’s called and, further,a tourist asked him what it was he wouldn’t be able to answer. So, enough being enough, Squinter put the question to Twitter – and back came around  replies, some of them fairly sensible, some#. Quart.. Barrackbuster.. Big milk.. Flagon Jar.. Green milk..

It’s a time to use our history to our advantage.”She added that the area was one of the most vibrant in the city and many people were passionate about it.“It is a bit of an affront that suggests we’re just not good enough, that we have the name of a place that does not belong to us,” she said.The UUP’s Alderman Chris McGimpsey said he would not support the motion as he believed the name was “logical” and a “sensible option”.“We were the basket case of Europe and we’re not any more. And we need to have the courage of our own convictions,” he said.“Belfast is a vibrant, proud, attractive city. It takes a vibrant, attractive city to be able to throw away the comfort blanket… and say we can take our place amongst the other cities in the world.“Ironically, by being able to choose the name Tribeca, which is obviously connected to New York City, we’re actually showing that.”UUP councillor Jeffrey Dudgeon endorsed his party colleague’s viewpoint and said he also would not support the motion."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660616.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/cattle_prod_seized.jpg","title":"cow prod used on pedestrians in northern ireland town from passing vehicle","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Theresa May will increase her efforts this week to win over her Brexit critics and seek fresh guarantees from Brussels ahead of the crunch vote on her deal. Ms Madigan said that the Prime Minister’s main priority is to secure enough support for her deal. “I think from listening to her comments yesterdayshe is certainly going to endeavour to do that and that’s her main priority at the moment but I think we have to allow the UK Parliament to do it themselves,” she added. “I don’t think it’s going to be helpful for me to comment on how they should do that but obviously we are hopeful that they will.”The Culture Minister added she “didn’t know”there will be a hard Brexit. “I would remain hopeful that a deal can be struck and we hope that Theresa May will get this deal through her Parliament and there will be a Withdrawal Agreement and then a future relationship can be ironed out and there will be no hard border. “I think at this stage it will be premature to try and say anything other than that.”She added that the Irish Government has contingency plans in place for a no-deal Brexit while Ministers will be updating Cabinet every two weeks on their preparation for a chaotic Brexit. Meanwhile, the minister also defended her comments after she advised aspiring female politicians who want to run for office to “get a good husband”they do.She told the Irish Independent: “Get good childcare, get a good husband, have the confidence and don’t over-think it.”However, Fianna Fail TD Anne Rabbitt said that women don’t need a husband to succeed in politics. Ms Madigan defended her remarks saying she was paying tribute to her husband. “When you’re a politician whatever family support you have is going to be crucial,” she said. “When you have school runs and extra-curricular activities andyou are based at Leinster House, I would have found it very dficult in the absence of his support and that was the point I am making. “You need a support system and I think every politician would say that. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a husband, it can be a partner, or we, or mother or father or neighbours but I think you need the support particularlyyou have dependants living with you.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest travel updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential.

They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However, I do prefer to buy and shop from local family businesses.And for all those curious about Veganuary, are taking part for the first time or are interested in finding out more, Ms Thomas will be holding a VeganJanuary fair in Penarthrsquos Paget Rooms on Sunday, January  from pm to pm.There will be a iety of stalls including Melrsquos Kindness Kitchen Vegan Cheeses, Lottiersquos Vegan Bakery and more.For more information, search Absolutely Fabulous Vegan Fayres on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
