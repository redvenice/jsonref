There are plans for the archives pieces to go on display to the public along with more than 50 notebooks on Holy Grail and the 1979 film Life Of BrianScenes and jokes deemed controversial at the time were discarded while the Pink Knight material is very politically incorrect from a modern viewpoint.The archives also reveal how Holy Grail, a typically Pythonesque take on the exploits of King Arthur and his knights, was meant to have a different ending – an epic battle scene – but it was ditched to save money.          Graham Chapman, who played the titular character, accused his fellow Pythons of greed and selfishness in a handwritten note sent before the film\u0027s release in 1979In one of the unseen sketches a man appears from the desert in need of a beer only to find a Wild West saloon which is actually a bookshop.The Pink Knight sketch, which was written by Palin and Jones, begins with a knight standing \u0027in a slightly camp pose\u0027 while declaring that King Arthur cannot cross a bridge unless he gives him a kiss.Another unused script in the archive has a handwritten sequence for Sir Tristram, a knight who tries ineptly to track down the grail using scientific principles.Palin, 75, has given permission for the sketches to be reproduced and said the group often created more material than was needed.Among the more controversial draft sketches to come out of the archive is one which sees Lazarus visiting his doctor with \u0027post-death depression\u0027.Written by Michael Palin, the sketch sees Lazarus\u0027s doctor criticise Jesus for resurrecting the dead, adding \u0027he has nothing against him personally.\u0027 But Palin himself abandoned the sketch, branding it \u0027as pat, neat and predictable as a bad university sketch.\u0027Other documents reveal the Phythons\u0027 lawyer telling them he was \u0027a little nervous\u0027 about a scene in which a woman claims to have fallen pregnant by the Holy Spirit, branding it \u0027a horny little poltergeist.\u0027 He also told the team to cut a scene in which they refer to Jesus as \u0027some long-haired conjurer\u0027. Monty Python: Fraught memo reveals strife over Life of Brian | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/02/09/4EC2E2E800000578-6018527-image-m-9_1533200300508.jpg","title":"Rare 5 note engraved portrait Englands Harry Kane spent licence Wales","story":"    Graham Short has etched a portrait of Harry Kane (pictured) on to a number of £5 notes.

His mother is a professor of computer science at Deakin University.Venkatesh recalls having a ‘fairly normal suburban existence’ growing up, despite being a maths prodigy. As a child, he won medals in the physics and maths Olympiads before becoming the youngest person to study at the University of Western Australia at the age of 13.He went straight into second year after proving that he could answer all of the exam questions on first-year subjects.One of his earliest mentors, Professor Cheryl Praeger, described him as ‘extraordinary’.At 16, Venkatesh graduated with first-class honours in pure mathematics and went on to study at Princeton.His adviser there, Peter Sarnak, also praised Venkatesh for his ‘remarkable insights’, telling Quanta: ‘It was clear that it was just a matter of time before he was going to put things together in unusual ways.’          The Fields Medal winners pose for photos with some attendees during the opening ceremony of the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Aug 1, 2018However, Venkatesh told the site that he felt like he did not have ‘a happy time as a graduate student’.‘I didn’t really feel like… I had added something very original. I don’t think I got the sense out of graduate school that I can do research.’Venkatesh tackled feeling down by reading maths texts on subjects far removed from his field—a coping mechanism that turned out to be the key to finding out what sort of mathematician he really wanted to be. A lot of his work features insights from other areas of mathematics.Venkatesh is married to Sarah Paden, who is finishing her doctoral dissertation in musicology at Princeton, and the couple have two children.What did Akshay Venkatesh win the Fields Medal for?The International Mathematical Union awarded Akshay Venkatesh the Fields Medal for: ‘His synthesis of analytic number theory, homogeneous dynamics, topology, and representation theory, which has resolved long-standing problems in areas such as the equidistribution of arithmetic objects.’Venkatesh, however, was surprised at winning the prize. \u0027It’s very difficult to grasp that I’m one of them,\u0027 he told Quanta. He didn\u0027t expect to win because his work is conjectural, whereas the traditional Fields Medal winners are ones who have solved a famous problem. Who else won the Fields Medal 2018?   This year\u0027s prize was also awarded to three other mathematicians:  Italian Alessio Figalli from ETH Zurich, German Peter Scholze and Caucher Birkar, from Cambridge. Birkar is a Kurdish refugee who came to Britain who grew up in a Kurdish city in Iran to farmer parents. His 14-carat gold medal was reportedly stolen just minutes after he accepted it at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Brazil. Who is Emin Agalarov?

Thankfully, Peter Astbury’s award-wining health tech wristband now offers a stylish solutionPerimenopause – also known as the menopause transition – is experienced by millions of women every year. The months or years leading up to the menopause can have very similar symptoms to the menopause itself, although some of these symptoms may change or disappear over time. “The most common symptoms are hot flushes and night sweats, but there are also other symptoms that are less thought about,” explains Dr Louise Newson, who specialises in treating women going through the perimenopause and menopause. “Migraines, palpitations, memory problems, low mood, anxiety, joint pain, muscle stiffness, poor sleep, reduced libido,” she adds.It’s the more obscure symptoms – migraines, low mood, tiredness – that many women fail to identify as part of perimenopause, something Newson partly puts down to the “big taboo” of the menopause itself. This lack of knowledge can have a severe impact. Not realising that symptoms are part of a bigger picture, many women fail to seek appropriate treatment. Newson cites examples of patients who falsely believe their memory loss is due to dementia, or who are incorrectly prescribed high doses of antidepressants by doctors who haven’t taken hormonal changes into account. But there may be other options. The Perimenopause Challenge is a category in the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Awards that aims to find technologies that can help women track the symptoms of perimenopause – enabling them to get better support and information. The Grace Wristband, developed by designer Peter Astbury and 2018 winner of the category, operates by easing one of the worst symptoms of the perimenopause – hot flushes. At the onset of a hot flush, says Astbury, the hypothalamus (the part of the brain that regulates body temperature) is falsely triggered. The Grace Wristband contains a set of sensors that detect this reaction, activating a “cooling tile” that delivers “intense cooling to the wrist”. The goal is to “use this sensation to signal to the hypothalamus that the body should retain heat” – a response directly opposite to a hot flush. This could, says Astbury, prevent women from waking up in the night with hot flushes, alleviating many of the sleep-related issues faced during perimenopause. Astbury describes one woman going through perimenopause who, waking up sweating 15 or 20 times a night, would get up and run her wrists under cold water to cool down. “I realised at that point that creating a product that could deal with night sweats was just as important as helping with hot flushes during the day,” he says. Astbury started developing Grace when he was just 22 and attending Loughborough University – a time when, perhaps unsurprisingly, he knew “next to nothing about menopause”.During his research, Astbury heard stories from many women – and it was these that left the biggest impression. “I regularly receive messages from women desperate to be involved as research participants so they can use Grace as soon as possible,” he says. As Newson – who was one of the judges for the Perimenopause Challenge category – points out, women’s health issues are not always discussed in an open or comfortable way something Astbury hopes will change.“In the UK, and the west in general, we have developed an environment where people don’t feel comfortable talking about things like perimenopause because of associations with ageing,” he says. “Many cultures don’t suffer from the same taboos as us – one study of Mayan culture found that the menopause was associated with freedom and status, and was therefore a positive milestone in life.”The design of the wristband, says Astbury, is an attempt to break down this stigma. “The aim is for women to wear Grace with confidence – the hope is that more people will feel they can openly talk about menopause.” Astbury is hopeful that a change is taking place: “Women are increasingly talking openly about menopause and its effects,” he says. “I hope that this change gains traction and that our culture continues to evolve and become more and more open about all health-related topics.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

At Bocketts Farm in Surrey, she was minding her one-year-old and newborn baby when another mother came running past, frantically searching for her more mobile six-year-old. He had wandered off on his own, no one knew where he’d got to, and there was no way to contact him. Wong thought: “Why can’t we be more connected to our younger children?”Enter the Gator Watch, a wearable tracking device with call functionality for kids who are too young for a smartphone but old enough to want a little more independence. Wong had researched her idea and found that while there were similar products already on the market in other countries, such as China, there was nothing quite like this. And nothing at all in the UK: the market was desperate for something that filled this communication gap for five- to 10-year-old children. “When I talk to parents, everyone is in agreement,” says Wong. “No one wants to give their kid a smartphone before secondary school, they just feel there’s nothing in the market for what they want, which is pure connection.”The watch can make and receive calls from 13 trusted numbers, it has an SOS button, and if your child wanders beyond defined safe zones you’re alerted as it happens. After eight months working with a manufacturer, Wong brought the watch to market, and this year her company, Techsixtyfour, which is staffed by working mums, won the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award for the Staying Independent with Tech Challenge. The category was set up to discover technologies that facilitate monitoring and emergency contact between caregivers and their charges.Last Christmas, Dave Housley bought the watch for his son Freddie, an eight-year-old kart-racing driver who spends a lot of time travelling to and from races: clocking up hundreds of miles is not an unusual way to spend a weekend for the Housley family. “At a kart race weekend, the kids are outside, they’re playing in the woods and doing stuff that kids should do. With this watch, we’ve got more confidence to let them do that because we can track them and we can get hold of them. It gives us a lot more confidence to let a kid be a kid in today’s world it gives you more confidence in letting them out of your sight.” The watch fulfils Housley’s need to know his son is safe, and it also works for Freddie. “He loved the whole concept of it,” says Housley. “It has that element of fun to it. He’s talking into it like it’s a James Bond watch.”The device has been a roaring success, and not only for reasons Wong predicted. It was always her plan to have the watch disconnected from the internet and social media, simply because she felt children should be able to have a childhood away from the glow of screens. But it wasn’t until she heard a policeman’s feedback that she realised it was solving a much bigger, and newer, societal problem.“He had bought the watch for his eight-year-old daughter because they live on an estate, and he was just afraid for his daughter to go outside,” she says. “But as a police officer, he knows that it’s far more dangerous for a child to stay at home and play on their screens. Parents might fear that allowing their children to go outside would mean they’d get kidnapped, but the amount of danger online is actually far higher – that parents are getting this wrong has been an eye-opener.”Wong has also found another vital use for the Gator Watch: helping older people. Ingrid Ehrlich’s husband, now 85, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s two years ago. “A year and a half ago he went for the newspaper,” says Ehrlich. “He did it every morning, and one day he didn’t come back. It was an hour before he went into the newsagent and bought the paper. Nobody can find out what he did in that hour.”Since getting the watch, Ehrlich has stopped locking the doors of the house in case her husband wanders off. He comes and goes as he pleases, while she monitors a map on her computer. “It’s the only thing he does on his own, so I encourage it. He just feels that he has much more freedom.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

Robert and his entourage of soldiers, who are all due to leave the city the next day, drink, quote Baudelaire and debate “the dirty trade of war”.“I did it to save the lives of people who had not hired out to fight,” the narrator explains. “There was that and the fact that I had learned to know and love an infantry ision and wished to serve it in any useful way I could … I also loved France and Spain next to my own country. I loved other countries too but the debt was paid and I thought that the account was closed, not knowing the accounts are never closed.”Hemingway had a particular fondness for Paris’s Ritz hotel, which also appears in The Sun Also Rises. In 1944, as the German occupying forces fled Paris, Hemingway, who was working as a war correspondent, arrived at the hotel in a Jeep with a group of soldiers and announced to the staff that he was there to liberate them – but was informed that the German dignitaries who had been occupying the building had already left. Hemingway then commandeered the bar and ordered champagne for everyone.“When I dream of afterlife in heaven, the action always takes place in the Paris Ritz,” Hemingway would later say.With other Hemingway papers, A Room on the Garden Side has been housed in the Library of Congress and the John F Kennedy library in Massachusetts.Six decades after it was written, A Room on the Garden Side is set to be published in the summer edition of the Strand magazine, a literary quarterly that has previously published obscure works by the likes of Raymond Chandler, John Steinbeck and HG Wells.“Hemingway’s deep love for his favourite city as it is just emerging from Nazi occupation is on full display, as are the hallmarks of his prose,” Strand managing editor Andrew F Gulli writes in an editorial note introducing the story.Kirk Curnutt, a board member of the Hemingway Society, wrote in an afterword that “the story contains all the trademark elements readers love in Hemingway”.“Steeped in talk of Marcel Proust, Victor Hugo, and Alexandre Dumas, and featuring a long excerpt in French from Charles Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs du Mal, the story implicitly wonders whether the heritage of Parisian culture can recover from the dark taint of fascism,” Curnutt wrote.War was a longtime muse for Hemingway. He worked as an ambulance driver during the first world war, drawing upon his experiences in A Farewell to Arms. The Spanish civil war inspired For Whom the Bell Tolls. He was both soldier and correspondent during the second world war, reporting on Paris’s liberation from Nazi occupation in August 1944 for Collier’s magazine.Numerous works were left unpublished after Hemingway killed himself in 1961. A Moveable Feast, his memoir of life in Paris in the 1920s, was published in 1964, three years after his death. Novels Islands in the Stream and The Garden of Eden were published in 1970 and 1986 respectively, and his non-fiction account of bullfighting The Dangerous Summer came out in 1985.During the last decade of his life, Hemingway wrote many other short stories set during the second world war. In August 1956, he told his publisher Charles Scribner Jr that he had completed five: A Room on the Garden Side, Black Ass at the Cross Roads, Indian Country and the White Army, The Monument, and The Bubble Reputation. Until now, only Black Ass at the Cross Roads had been published."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a32dbd55bf3aea1718ca5c0436d883afb2ff13e5/29_200_3458_2075/master/3458.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=131eee6dc14d25868f00d197bb8ceb93","title":"bank of england raises interest rates","story":"Monetary policy committee lifts cost of borrowing to highest level since 2009The Bank of England has raised interest rates above the emergency level introduced after the financial crisis despite mounting fears about the economic impact of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, told businesses and households there would be further increases in borrowing costs if economy continued to recover from a softer patch earlier this year, but he also signalled willingness to reverse the quarter-point increase in the event of a disorderly Brexit.Charles Hepworth of the City investment management company GAM said: “The Bank of England’s response in a few months’ time could look very different should the Brexit cliff edge slip nearer despite them saying more hikes will be needed.”In delivering its verdict on Thursday, the Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee voted unanimously for the increase, judging that the economy had bounced back from the effects of the “beast from the east” earlier this year.The MPC said recent readings for economic growth “appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter”.The Bank’s decision, only the third change in interest rates in the last decade, comes as fears mount over Brexit, with Theresa May facing parliamentary isions over her plan.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the rate rise would be bad news for hard-pressed households: “Given recent revelations that households are spending more than they receive in income for the first time since 1988, today’s rise will be a blow to those facing high levels of personal debt.”Business groups also criticised the decision given the mounting Brexit uncertainty which, along with higher borrowing costs, stood to deter firms from investing in Britain. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “The decision to raise interest rates, while expected, looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy.”There has been some better news for the economy in recent months, with the summer heatwave and royal wedding giving the country a shot in the arm by encouraging a rise in consumer spending. Inflation has fallen from its highest level in five years, and unemployment remains at its lowest level since the mid-1970s. Factory output has slowed, however, as global economic growth softens and Donald Trump slaps import tariffs on some of the US’s biggest trading partners, including the EU and China. Despite the low levels of unemployment in the UK, pay rises for British workers remain elusive. Having previously delayed raising interest rates in May, preferring to wait and see if the economy would recover, the decision had been widely expected this time. The unanimous vote is likely to stoke speculation that further increases are around the corner.

Pretty much any opportunity: BBC national radio, BBC TV, Channel 4, Sky – I’ve done them all over the years, for good or ill. Even when, as is not infrequently the case, the deck is somewhat stacked against me, or the timing inadequate for anything more than a soundbite, or the question up for debate less than ideal.But this Wednesday, when I was rung up by BBC Radio Cambridgeshire and asked to come on air to debate with a climate change denier, something in me broke, and rebelled. Really? I thought. This summer, of all times?So, for almost the first time in my life, I turned it down. I told it that I will no longer be part of such charades. I said that the BBC should be ashamed of its nonsensical idea of “balance”, when the scientific debate is as settled as the “debate” about whether smoking causes cancer. By giving climate change deniers a full platform, producers make their position seem infinitely more reasonable than it is. (This contributes to the spread of misinformation and miseducation around climate change that fuels the inaction producing the long emergency we are facing.)From a public service broadcaster, this is simply not good enough.What makes it so frustrating is that there are important debates to be had around climate change. And so I told the Beeb that I would be very happy to come on and take part in a different debate. For example, we should be debating whether the Paris climate accord is going to be enough, or if we need to do more. Or discussing just how radically our society needs to change to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, and how we should rethink our activism.But I will no longer put up with the absurd notion that a straight debate about the science can be justified, especially given the fundamental truth that we’ve known for decades: that even if there were any real room for doubt about the science, we should still take radical action to safeguard a liveable climate, on the basis of the Precautionary Principle. This principle of international law states that even the absence of certainty about the risk of widespread and catastrophic harm to the environment or public health ought not to stop us from taking preventive action to head off such potentially ruinous harms.BBC Cambridgeshire is based in Cambridge, the science capital of the UK. I expected better from it, especially after the well-publicised ruling this year that the way that the BBC has been promoting climate change deniers on air is no longer acceptable.In the end, the broadcast went ahead without me. Much of it wasn’t bad. The scientists interviewed were excellent. But the framing of the debate was awful, and framing is everything, so far as the message that most listeners receive is concerned. The presenter introduced the segment by asking, “Is climate change real?” The journalist doing vox pops bombarded ordinary people with canards such as, “Maybe it’s just a natural cycle?” And, of course, a climate change denier was given a huge and undeserved platform on an equal basis to his opponent.In August 2018, this is unacceptable and it seems that quite a lot of people agree with me.However, here’s the exciting thing. If we get more momentum behind the idea of refusing to participate, it will force a change of coverage methods by the BBC, which experts have been calling for for years. For if we all refuse to debate with the climate change deniers on public platforms, and press the BBC to catch up with the 21st century, it will be forced to change its ways, because the BBC cannot defend the practice of allowing a climate change denier to speak unopposed. If we truly want to see change on this issue, we need to be willing to let it know exactly how we feel. So, now I’m going to get on with filing my official complaint to the BBC …• Rupert Read teaches philosophy at the University of East Anglia and chairs the Green House thinktank"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d70c3d4715c95b25a91f516282f5a179530bf830/0_1557_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d52e5dae971e94ffaf3c52739a6178d","title":"the day the snake came and my struggles with pink disappeared","story":"An enormous python hung around a gazebo where I was working. ‘What do you portend, snake?’ I askedOn Monday I was at my uncle’s house in Brisbane, determined to finish a story that had plagued me. Every writer meets their nemesis – mine was a think piece on the singer Pink.Each day I would sit at my laptop streaming Pink’s music and writing thousands of words – none of which was cohering into an argument. The piece was weeks late. And by Monday the bloated draft included quotes from John Howard, Andrew Breitbart and a random selection of 13-year-old Pink fans. It was a mess. Raise Your Glass played from the computer for the 105th time. I wanted to die.I tweeted: “Literally this th!nk piece on P!nk is going to be the death of me.”As I pressed send and I returned to the dreaded piece, something moved in my peripheral vision. Was it? No, it can’t be! Yes it was!An enormous python slithered from the between the slats in the gazebo where I was working and towards my laptop.I leapt back. The snake moved forward. A strange sound came out of my mouth. It was not the high-pitched shriek that I thought I would make on seeing a two metre-long python coming at me. It was more of a guttural yell, like I had been hit at close range in the face with a basketball.“Arrgh,” I yelled. “Arrghhh, help!”My aunt came running out. She thought something had gone wrong with my laptop and I had lost my Pink piece. By now the snake was casually flung across a chair and over the table, like one of Donald Trump’s very long ties.It moved noiselessly, even playfully around the table, and then back up the walls of the gazebo, wrapping itself around a decorative cabinet. The aesthetic effect of the snake against the cabinet was strangely pleasing (they matched) but the emotional effect of seeing such a large wild animal near my laptop was fear and disbelief.True Queenslanders, my aunt and uncle looked at the snake with nonchalance, as if it was a rainbow lorikeet or an ibis in their garden.No, they had not seen it before. Maybe it had come from the creek. Yes, it was big. I cowered behind them.“It’s harmless,” said my uncle. “Look, it’s just eaten.”The snake looked like it had swallowed a large possum. A bulge in its middle was preventing it from moving through the slats of the gazebo. Like a fat man trying to get into skinny jeans – it sort of gave up and just hung out there. Would it just stay in that position until it had shat out the possum?That’s if it was a possum ...Last year while travelling in Indonesia, I had become transfixed by a news story about a farmer who had been swallowed whole by a python. He had been missing for a while, when the python – with a suspiciously large lump in its body – was “spotted slithering awkwardly in Salubiro village”.It was captured, cut open and the man’s body was found inside fully clothed. Fully clothed!I thought about Pink. This was all her fault. I had tweeted: “Literally this th!nk piece on P!nk is going to be the death of me. And then a two-metre long python appears.”It was as if the snake was summoned, just like what happens in the Bible, when shit’s about to get real. Because a snake of course, is never just a snake. It’s a very powerful symbol that humans have used in storytelling and myth throughout the ages, not just as a metaphor but as a portent.“What do you portend, snake?” I asked.The snake did not move for a while, and my uncle assured me it was safe to continue working.Focusing on the Pink think piece was now impossible. I jumped at shadows, I looked at my handbag and thought I saw it moving.The sheer existence of the snake up in the eaves – digesting – was a fact that shook me somehow, like it was an apparition or holy vision that seemed unbelievable even though I was staring right at it. “Look at that snake,” I kept murmuring to no one in particular. “Just look at it.”I tweeted pictures of the snake and the ision on Twitter was sharp: there were those that replied in ALL CAPS that I should set the snake on fire or behead it with a shovel and those who said the snake was beautiful and unique, and I was very lucky to see one so close.For the next 24 hours I wandered outside, looked up at the snake – which had not moved – and would say aloud: “The snake – it’s still there.”“Look at the snake, its still there.”“I wonder if there are any road workers missing?”The snake had taken up residence not just in the gazebo but in my consciousness. My mate Trav, who is a real estate agent in Byron Bay, had told me, “Just wait until it shits everywhere. There’s one that lives in the garage of my vacant listing, it eats, then sleeps, then shits everywhere.”But over time my thinking about the python evolved. I stopped fearing it. It hadn’t given me the evil eye or hissed or shown any inclination that it might eat me.It was wild and beautiful, and although I shouldn’t touch it, I realised I shouldn’t be scared of it either. I shouldn’t want to set it on fire or murder it with a shovel just because it exists near where I exist.When I left Brisbane on Tuesday, it was still there, up in the gazebo, the sun on its skin, the bulge still … bulging.I texted my uncle on Wednesday night. He told me the snake “has been asleep for two days. Just hanging around. Tummy still full. Heavy work.”As in life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33905bbe437e1c6b1ba318b01325370fd37a3344/0_244_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0f71ff6acc298e60e92d025c092477a","title":"the guardian view on butterflies elegant ambassadors for insects","story":"It is almost four decades since Blue Peter editor Biddy\u0026nbspBaxter found out about a new survey being run by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). The\u0026nbspidea was that junior birdwatchers would count the birds in their gardens, to find out which were the 10 most common species. After Ms Baxter featured it on the programme, 34,000 children joined in, and the Great\u0026nbspGarden Birdwatch has run every year since.Volunteers and amateurs without scientific training have long had a crucial role to play in nature conservation. Over the last decade, such efforts have increasingly been grouped under the heading of citizen science. Provided you are somewhere in the UK, this is a good time to join in, because the Big Butterfly Count – the younger cousin of the birdwatch – is on and running until 12 August.Butterflies, like nearly all wildlife, are having a rough time. Since the heatwave summer of 1976, we have lost around half of our abundant butterflies – the generalist species found in gardens, parks and countryside all over the UK – and three quarters of our habitat specialists – those butterflies that rely on rarer plants and settings for their food. As with wild birds, intensive farming is the main cause, with recent evidence suggesting that the introduction of neonicotinoid pesticides in the 1990s may also have been a factor.It’s not all bad news: broadly speaking, British butterflies are thought to be among climate change’s winners, because the UK is in the northern range of most of the 59 species that live here, meaning rising temperatures can enable them to move into new territory. This summer the marbled white, purple emperor and black hairstreak are doing well, while the warm spring provided a boost for the most endangered of all British butterflies: the high brown fritillary. But the drought conditions are perilous for caterpillars, since many of the plants and grasses they feed on have dried out, and this year’s warm and sunny boom could well be followed by a 2019 bust.Big fluctuations in populations are normal for butterflies, so conservationists focus on longer-term trends. But the count – run by the charity Butterfly Conservation, which is 50 this year and also focuses on moths – produces valuable information about how\u0026nbspbutterflies are doing in green spaces such as urban gardens that conservationists are usually unable to access. The delicacy and glorious colour of butterflies, and their metamorphosis from creepy-crawly to gorgeous, fluttering flight, has won them far more affection and prominence in human minds than other insects. Because of the long tradition of collecting and observing them, British butterflies are the most studied group of insects in the world. Though\u0026nbspants, bees and others have their champions, this realm of the animal kingdom is often overlooked by humans, and sometimes disliked. Butterflies are ideal\u0026nbspambassadors for the insect world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e684191b43a9149cc1c12b7b8c206cd942a0fac/0_232_2644_1586/master/2644.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49819b5bffd1d23b631614401c6458dd","title":"student loans company spied on vulnerable students social media","story":"Exclusive: Support workers say estranged students lost funding despite no finding of guilt of fraudThe Student Loans Company (SLC) has been accused of spying on the social media accounts of vulnerable students as part of an anti-fraud drive that resulted in some losing funding and dropping out of university despite no finding of guilt against them.SLC made a random selection of 150 estranged students, part of a group recognised as vulnerable because they have no relationship with their parents and tend to be financially disadvantaged, and asked them to provide evidence that they no longer had contact with their families.According to charity workers now supporting some of the students affected, if they failed to respond within 28 days with the required proof their funding was suspended and in some cases their social media accounts were monitored to try to find out if there had been any contact with parents.Minutes of an SLC meeting seen by the  said 81 of the 150 had funding withdrawn. That figure has since fallen as cases have been resolved, but campaigners say the affected students, many of whom have mental health problems, have suffered enormous stress and hardship.Becca Bland, the chief executive of Stand Alone, a charity that supports estranged people, said affected students had the third and final instalment of their maintenance and fee loans suspended. Some had to wait five months to have it reinstated, leading to extreme poverty, homelessness, defaults on tenancy agreements and a deterioration in their mental health.She described the anti-fraud exercise as ill-considered and heavy-handed. “Stand Alone understands the need to monitor fraud within the student population, but the vulnerabilities and characteristics of young adults who are estranged from their family must be taken into consideration in processes.“Students who are estranged from family suffer from extreme financial disadvantage whilst studying at university as they don’t have family support, and may have mental health difficulties linked to abuse, neglect or rejection from their family or the time they may have spent in the care system.“In this exercise, the actions of this fraud investigation have had negative consequences on students, who have had their funding cut off for many months, have been forced into homelessness or sofa surfing, and in some cases have dropped out of university.“It is both ethically and practically unacceptable to cut off a vulnerable student’s maintenance loan and fee loan prior to finding a student guilty of fraud. The idea of a financial institution monitoring a random sample of students’ social media to determine their family relationships is unsettling, and an invasion of their privacy.”James Smith, 20, quit his studies after his funding was suspended as a result of the fraud investigation. He denies doing anything fraudulent and feels that he has been treated like a criminal. He said he had been left with no choice but to give up his place studying zoology at Salford University, ending his dream of opening an animal sanctuary.He said the SLC had picked through his Facebook account in an attempt to find evidence of contact with his family, and had leapt to the wrong conclusions after finding a five or six word post. “I’m dropping out of university now. I’m not strong enough to be honest.,” he said. “I can’t even find the words to tell you how it’s made me feel. It’s been an absolute nightmare. My house mates were worried when they saw me not eating and not sleeping. It’s all I think about. It’s had a dramatic effect on me. I feel like I’ve been persecuted.” An SLC spokesperson said that as a result of the anti-fraud exercise one student had had all funding removed after submitting a fraudulent estrangement letter, five students would no longer receive the additional estrangement element of their funding, three voluntarily withdrew their application for estrangement funding before the process started and one withdrew during the process.“There are currently 34 students who have not yet responded to our requests for information and, as a result, we have withheld the third instalment of their maintenance and fee loans,” the spokesperson said. “We would ask them to please call us on 0141 243 3324 as soon as possible to allow us to review their evidence and future funding.”Stand Alone has called for an urgent review of the investigation and the reinstatement of funding to those who have been cut off without any proof of fraud.A spokesperson for the National Union of Students said: “The number of students applying for estrangement status is low and at every opportunity the SLC should remain sensitive to the situation these students find themselves in and refrain from overzealous responses.“It is also critical that appropriate means of communication and language are used and that students are directed to sources of support to avoid confusion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c67313977c046259c4dceb662f83cf07bf5ab465/157_0_1062_637/master/1062.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf7feb075ea894b42847d73189e05bb8","title":"if beale street could talk barry jenkins moonlight","story":"Oscar-winner’s James Baldwin adaptation tipped for further awards glory once it premieres at the Toronto film festivalBarry Jenkins, the Oscar-winning writer-director of Moonlight, has revealed the trailer for his much-anticipated new film If Beale Street Could Talk.It’s an adaptation of James Baldwin’s 1974 novel and Jenkins shared the first footage on Twitter to coincide with what would have been the author’s 94th birthday. The plot follows Tish and Fonny, a couple torn apart by a false rape accusation. As Tish prepares to give birth to her child, she must find evidence to free Fonny.It stars newcomer Kiki Layne and Race star Stephan James as the central duo, with Chi-Raq’s Tayonnah Parris, The Leftovers’ Regina King and Atlanta’s Bryan Tyree Henry in support. Jenkins wrote the screenplay at the same time as he wrote Moonlight in 2013.Jenkins’ critically acclaimed drama about the life of a gay man in Miami became the first film with an all-black cast and an LGBT lead to win the best picture Oscar in 2017. Jenkins also won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay with Tarell Alvin McCraney, who he showed an early cut of Beale Street to earlier this year.“Tarell made this beautiful comment after seeing a cut of the film,” Jenkins said in April. “He’s like: ‘Oh, you made this New York. It’s not a New York of places. It’s a New York of faces.’ I think the faces that existed in the time of Baldwin are still present in the New York I see today and the New York that we made this film.”In 1974, Baldwin spoke to the  about his book. “Every poet is an optimist,” he said to Hugh Hebert.

Now the news is all about tinned goods flying off the shelves, which is probably because we don’t have the World Cup to distract us from reality any more.As a sign of how much patriotic fervour had taken hold of the country, there was no better guide than people deciding to dress as Gareth Southgate, fashion icon. Nothing in life made more sense than buying a Southgate waistcoat before the semi-final against Croatia and it was because of one man finding a way to make supporters rekindle their passion for the England team.That does not mean Southgate is the greatest manager in history. Any sober analysis of his decisions during the World Cup would have to factor in criticism of his substitutions against Colombia and Croatia. Yet his status as a national hero owed less to his tactical prowess than admiration for how he set about altering perceptions of English footballers with a positive and modern approach, creating an ego-free culture of engagement and an openness in which Danny Rose felt comfortable talking about depression. All it required was a human touch for the public to connect with Southgate and his team.Yet the return of club football has brought a different mood, with the past fortnight dominated by stories of José Mourinho’s grouchiness on Manchester United’s pre-season tour in the US. A dark cloud is hanging over the head of United’s manager, threatening to shower Old Trafford with gloom, and there are probably many at Chelsea raising a knowing eyebrow at Mourinho’s deepening cynicism, his complaints about signings and his habit of aiming pointed digs at whichever person happens to have lost his trust this time.This is how it has reached the stage where you can have a position on whether Anthony Martial has made the right decision to stay in Paris after the birth of his second child. Martial left United’s tour last week and although Mourinho did not criticise him for flying home after his partner went into labour, he was less sympathetic when the forward failed to catch the next flight back to America as soon as his son had made his entrance. “He has the baby and after the baby is born – beautiful baby, full of health, thank God – he should be here and he is not here,” Mourinho said, with Martial now expected to be fined two weeks’ wages.Mourinho’s frustration is understandable given many of United’s players are still on holiday. All the same, it is worth comparing his comments about Martial with Southgate’s view when Fabian Delph left the England camp during the World Cup to be with his pregnant wife. Delph missed the last-16 tie against Colombia, leaving his manager short of midfield depth on the bench, but his absence was handled with empathy.“It’s a bit of perspective in life,” Southgate said. “There’s only one day in your life when your child is born. You have to be there for your family. The thought process is some things in life are more important than football. His wife is due to go into labour. This is a big tournament but family is more important. I can’t speak highly enough of his character around the group, but his focus should be with his family at this time.”No doubt Mourinho loyalists will say Delph returned to Russia in good time for England’s quarter-final against Sweden. They might also argue that a manager as successful as Mourinho has nothing to learn from Southgate, who took Middlesbrough down to the Championship in 2009 and got the England job only when Sam Allardyce got too talkative over a pint of wine.But stop for a moment and consider whether it is really worth engaging in a point-scoring exercise because Martial has had the temerity to award himself some extra paternity leave. Proof of his loyalty does not depend on giving up time with his family. Yet football has a habit of clinging on to old-fashioned ideals, demanding conformity and obedience even when those values jar with the real world.This is the kind of episode which feeds into the idea that Mourinho’s style of man-management does not sit well with modern players. In his first spell at Chelsea he was seen as a genius motivator and he has spoken about his success with confrontational leadership, explaining it is about being “ready to provoke your players, to try to create some conflict, with the intention to bring out the best from them”. Yet the defining feature of Mourinho’s second spell at Stamford Bridge was his troubled relationship with Eden Hazard, his best and most skilful player.It comes as no surprise that Martial, a talented 22-year-old whose career has stalled since Mourinho’s appointment two years ago, wants a fresh start away from United. Young, creative forwards have often struggled to see eye to eye with Mourinho, whose increasingly glum demeanour is in danger of weighing down his team before the season has started.While Mourinho has griped about taking a weakened squad to America, Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp and Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola have expressed their delight at being able to work with their youngsters. They have sounded full of hope and optimism, whereas Mourinho’s act comes across as tired. The time has come for him to cheer up, buy a waistcoat and phone Martial to tell him that children are our future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13398bfa868e159451ab53ae4b3103ffed33d818/0_37_2080_1248/master/2080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b0af5ea6a3fabc5d71845ac7dbe31cf","title":"burnley v aberdeen europa league qualifying second leg live","story":"Sean Dyche speaks! “It really was a big test.

But Considine sticks out a peg to deflect the ball out for a corner. Wonderful last-ditch defending.Right, here we go again! Aberdeen get the first period of extra time underway. Charlie Taylor has replaced Ward at left back for Burnley.Cork swings a Hail Mary into the mixer, but Devlin clears easily. And we’ll have 30 minutes of extra time!90 min +2: Make that 60 seconds.90 min +1: The first corner, on the right, leads to a second on the left. Mackay-Steven tries to find Cosgrove with his delivery, but overcooks it. Turf Moor prepares for 30 minutes of additional play ... unless something very dramatic happens in the next 120 seconds. 90 min: Cosgrove sends Mackay-Steven into acres down the right with a searching crossfield pass. Mackay-Steven skitters into the area and purchases a cheap corner. There will be three added minutes.88 min: Aberdeen make their second change, replacing Hoban at the back with Dominic Ball.87 min: Wright whips the free kick to the far post. Considine can’t get a touch. The ball flies inches wide of goal. So close to deciding this tie!86 min: Shinnie is taken down by Cork as he sashays down the left. That’s a free kick, and a chance to load the box. But before the set piece can be taken, Lennon is replaced by 18-year-old Dwight McNeil.85 min: From the corner, Aberdeen launch a counter. Suddenly Wright is dribbling at pace down the middle, with players on either side! He drops a shoulder to leave Lowton, but is cynically brought to ground before he can set a team-mate away. A booking. But that could have been a whole lot worse for Burnley.84 min: Lennon dribbles with great purpose down the inside-right channel. He nearly opens Aberdeen up. But he’s forced to turn back. Burnley come again, Cork shooting from distance. Deflected wide for another corner.83 min: Gudmundsson drives down the left and earns a corner off Hoban. He takes it himself, and it’s awful, straight down the throat of Lewis. Nerves are beginning to play a part now.81 min: McGinn - who has excelled tonight - looks kaput, having given his all. He’s replaced by 20-year-old Scott Wright.79 min: Shinnie isn’t far away from slipping Mackay-Steven into the area. Then Cosgrove converts in the rugby style from 20 yards, the ball sailing high into the darkening sky. Burnley hearts were in mouths, though, because a second away goal for Aberdeen now would put the hosts in all sorts of bother.77 min: Considine is booked for clipping Lennon to the floor out on the right wing. It’s a chance for Burnley to load the box. But the resulting free kick is a whole load of nonsense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeac042a9f564e279a2a99b781ce496b27b8c2f4/891_583_5016_3008/master/5016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d47e2dc7e9a82b6c9f567b35928ea878","title":"auf wedersehen britain brexit forcing my german family leave home","story":"Alexander Menden enjoyed his dream job in London, his wife working in the NHS, their boys supporting England in the World Cup. But the disaster that is Brexit has changed all that‘So you’re going home.” This is something I hear a\u0026nbsplot when I tell people that my wife and I have decided to move to Germany after 14 years of living in London. My reply is always the same: “Actually, we are leaving our home. This is our home.” We are moving to a country that my wife and I were born in and are citizens of, but which our children know only as a holiday destination. There was – and is – no burning desire on our part to live in Germany. I never missed the impoliteness, control freakery and permanent moaning that I associate with much of German public life.There is, however, a definite urge to leave Britain, a country that has lost its way and, with it, many of its best qualities. In public discourse, pragmatism, level-headedness and tolerance (or at least benevolent indifference) have been largely replaced by uncompromising partisanship. The result of the EU referendum dismayed me, but did not surprise me. Ever since my time at Oxford University in the mid-90s, I had been aware of the deeply entrenched anti-EU sentiment, especially among politics graduate students – some of whom would go on to work with pro-Brexit politicians and in the\u0026nbspmedia.What that time did not prepare me for was the absurd spectacle that post-referendum British politics has mutated into. There seems to be no fudge, no disaster, no incompetence to which Britain’s current, distressingly myopic and feckless batch of politicians refuse to stoop, be they in government or opposition. The unworkable white paper thrashed out at Chequers, and the resignations, parliamentary chaos and no-deal threats resulting from it, have thrown the current level of ineptitude in British politics into sharp relief.After the referendum, there was a\u0026nbspshift in my journalistic remit. Before, I had what I will always consider the best job imaginable – reporting on the arts for the Süddeutsche Zeitung from the most culturally exciting and erse city in the world. It was every arts journalist’s dream: I covered everything from the Turner\u0026nbspprize to the Booker prize and interviewed artists such as Anish Kapoor, Ian McKellen and the Rolling Stones.Since 24 June 2016, however, my job has been wall-to-wall Brexit coverage. I would not have been doing it properly if it had been any different. From a British perspective, it is the defining topic of our era, even though many Brits seem to prefer to ignore it, hoping it will just go away. In the run-up to the implementation of article 50 in March 2017, for instance, I started writing a daily “Countdown” column covering stories such as the diminished “Brexit Toblerone” to the harassment of our Polish friends after the referendum – and tracing how my perception of Britain had been changed by the result.Brexit even made its way into arts coverage – for example, the National Gallery’s attempt to buy a painting by Jacopo da Pontormo from a US banker was scuppered by the slump in sterling, while the European Union Youth Orchestra, which had always had its headquarters in London, was forced to move to Italy.My journeys outside the London bubble, before as well as after the referendum, made me aware of the broad spectrum of reasons for the Brexit vote, as well as of the fallout that is already happening, or is on the horizon. They showed me a Britain that is ided and directionless. Yet,\u0026nbsplooking at much of the domestic coverage, you would not know this. In most British media, journalists seem biased and underinformed in equal measure – and peddle the “will of the people” line unchallenged. One of the untruths repeated unquestioningly is the British government’s assertion that the status of the 3 million EU-citizens in this country is secure. Despite official protestations, it is still unclear what this status will be after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. If the “settlement scheme” that the home secretary, Sajid Javid, has announced goes ahead, we would at best have to apply and pay to secure as a privilege something that free movement has so far guaranteed. Free movement is neither a privilege nor some kind of transactional immigration deal. It is a reciprocal arrangement between EU member states, which formed the legal basis of our move to Britain all those years ago. It has been changed unilaterally by the British government. We had no say in it.Being used as bargaining chips for two years and then allowed to stay in our home for a fee, turning from citizens into supplicants, is hardly a democratic process – even though, currently, it is the best-case scenario. The assertion that “nothing’s agreed until everything’s agreed”, recently reiterated by the trade secretary, Liam Fox, makes it clear that, should there be a no-deal Brexit, all of this would be irrelevant. At worst, we could be stuck in Britain with no legal status at all. In the light of all this, it is surely better to jump than wait to be pushed.To those who are tempted to reassure us that “it won’t happen”, I\u0026nbspcan only say: look at the many instances over the past few years where you said the same, and then precisely that thing happened. Of course, Germany has its own problems. In her capricious interior minister, Horst Seehofer, Angela Merkel now has her own Boris Johnson-type loose cannon. However, in Germany at least we won’t be totally politically disenfranchised. EU citizens had no say in any of the Brexit decisions – Commonwealth citizens living in the\u0026nbspUK were allowed to participate in\u0026nbspthe EU referendum, we weren’t and we never had the vote in parliamentary elections. What our status would be in local elections (which we have been able to vote in so far) is up in the air, as everything is still legally unclear.I imagine reactions to our departure will range from, “Oh, but we didn’t mean people like you” to “Good riddance, you won’t be missed”. To the former, I would reply: it doesn’t matter the damage is done. Brexit will affect all EU citizens in the UK (and UK citizens in the EU) equally, and you don’t get to pick and choose. I do, however, tend to agree with the latter. The country won’t suffer terribly from having one fewer foreign arts journalist. It will be harder to replace the rest of my family, though. My sons – 13, 11, and seven years old – have dual citizenship but are all UK-born and have never lived outside Cricklewood, north-west London. All three were among the best students in their respective classes. They are rooted in Britain, and have visited (and in some cases been dragged to) more National Trust and English Heritage sites than you can shake a stick at.When a young and very likable England team beat Colombia in their World Cup penalty shoot-out, my sons were delighted about the win. These were English boys supporting England. My children never had to choose between their German and British “identities” – a choice which I still hope they will never have to make. They have been very understanding about the reasoning behind the move. That doesn’t change the fact that they are leaving behind all their friends and, after a life shaped by the multiculturalism of one of the world’s great metropolises, now they will have to get used to an environment that is very different. For example, during our visit to his new school in Germany, one of my sons remarked, with some incredulity: “This is so weird – all the students are white!”My wife, meanwhile, is leaving behind her post as a paediatric consultant at a London hospital. It was her firm belief in the egalitarian principles of the National Health Service, as well as the excellent medical training, that brought us to Britain in 2004. Her skillset and expertise, which she was fully committed to offer the NHS for the rest of her career, will now be applied elsewhere, just like those of many other excellent healthcare professionals from the EU.Having listened to myself talking about all of this quite passionately to\u0026nbspa British friend, I asked him: “Am\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspoverthinking this?” “No,” he\u0026nbspsaid. “You are overfeeling it.” I\u0026nbsphave never considered myself an Anglophile hopefully, my response to this complex nation has been more nuanced than uncritical adoration. But perhaps my friend was right. Our response to Brexit is as much emotional as a practical. Isn’t that correct, though, considering that the leave vote was entirely rooted in emotion? It is not easy to stay calm and rational when faced with the visceral, self-aggrandising, jingoistic drivel that flows endlessly from some in the leave camp. It is painful to see how Britain, particularly England, has bought into its own imperial, nostalgic myth and is now falling prey to the resulting delusions.The discrepancy between the Brexit people thought they voted for\u0026nbspand the one they will get reminds me a little of the story of Boaty McBoatface: “The people” voted to give that name to a 125-metre-long, state-of-the-art research vessel with a top speed of 17 knots and a helipad. What they got was a tiny, remote-controlled, unmanned, bright yellow submersible that looks like a suppository. Yet Boaty McBoatface, as disappointing as it may look, is much more useful than any form of\u0026nbspBrexit. I would be delighted if this\u0026nbspgreat project of national self-harm were not to happen. Unfortunately, I\u0026nbspthink it will, and we want to be gone when it does. For whatever shape Brexit takes, it will inevitably be worse than what we – what all of\u0026nbspus – had before."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76fd446bc2307d799e498f04edb432cbf47833b9/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b613656641a2920ec933382313b30069","title":"womad visa fiasco brexit britain live music festival","story":"This isn’t the first time esteemed overseas artists have been refused entry to the UK for a festival. The Home Office is killing our world music scene – and it’s going to get worseThe UK has long been a leading destination for discovering sounds from far-flung corners of the globe, whether it is Malian songbird Oumou Sangaré’s set at Glastonbury, or the shadowy South African electro of DJ Lag in a sticky-floored club in London. But last weekend, that reputation was thrown into disarray following comments by Womad organiser Chris Smith, who lambasted the UK’s oppressive visa restrictions on world music artists. Three of the acts scheduled for the festival – Sabry Mosbah from Tunisia, Wazimbo from Mozambique and some of the members of Niger’s Tal National – were denied entry to the UK and either had to cancel their festival appearance or perform stripped-down sets. Indian duo Hashmat Sultana passed through border control 24 hours after they were due to go on stage. Smith said that an increasing number of performers were now declining invitations to the event because they deemed the Home Office’s iron-fisted process humiliating.Questions have been raised about what this means for the future of world music in the UK. The festival’s co-founder, Peter Gabriel, this week released a statement calling the situation “alarming” and asked: “Do we really want a white-breaded, Brexited flatland? A country that is losing the will to welcome the world?” Channel 4 News’s Jon Snow, meanwhile, tweeted: “The ‘hostile environment’ took its toll at Womad … a number of events were seriously affected by visa refusals. By definition, a festival of world music requires visas for many bands. What on Earth is the Home Office doing refusing them? Is music the new enemy?”From booking agents and gig promoters to festival curators and artists themselves, many have had disheartening experiences trying to bring esteemed musicians into the country. Each time, they must navigate a confusing matrix of box-ticking processes via outsourced application centres only for a visa to be refused regardless, causing gigs to be cancelled at the last minute and money lost.“It’s definitely the toughest country to enter,” says Ben Makkes, manager for the 82-year-old Ghanaian highlife pioneer Ebo Taylor, denied a visa last year despite playing in the UK many times during his 60-year career. During his application, the visa office kept his band’s passports for weeks, meaning they couldn’t travel elsewhere in Europe, missing vital shows. “There was no communication, no help whatsoever,” says Makkes. “The reason they eventually gave us was insufficient funds on accounts, even though my company had stated that we would cover all costs. In the end we lost €20,000 (£17,000) in flights and fees, and I don’t think we’ll come back to the UK because of that.”That despair is reiterated by many artists abroad. The Serbian DJ Tijana T told dance music site Resident Advisor she felt “like a criminal” after having her UK visa denied three times last year. Booking agent Clementine Bunel agrees that artists find it “demoralising”, while Seun Kuti, son of Afrobeat legend Fela, said on the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire show last week: “What we musicians go through is hell”.The UK visa process for entertainers does indeed sound like a gift from Satan himself. It is eye-wateringly complex, costly (£245 slow-track much more for premium fast-track) and certainly not user-friendly. Steve Richard, of entertainment specialists T\u0026ampS Immigration Services, explains that applicants must fill out an online form, containing sections that are “not entirely clear”, followed by a personal appearance at a visa application centre. “Some people will live near a VAC but many won’t, particularly in Africa,” says Richard. “Applicants from Mali, for example, have to travel to Dakar in Senegal for their nearest VAC”, and trips such as these, which can be about 1,000 miles each way, for 15 band members can cost several thousand pounds.“It’s an absolute scandal,” says Paul Duhaney, director of Liverpool’s annual Africa Oyé festival. “It’s like me having to go to the USA, but going to Moscow to get my visa. I just wouldn’t do it. So why are we expecting African artists, or artists from anywhere for that matter, to go to another country for interviews?”Performers invited by a number of approved events such as Womad (there are 45 in the UK in total) can apply for a permit-free festival visitor visa without the need to issue a certificate of sponsorship. But they must “provide bank statements showing a consistent balance of around £1,000 for at least three months,” says Richard. Even these visas are clearly no longer guaranteed, often due, according to David Jones, a director at live music producer Serious, to spiralling processing times. “What used to be the absolute maximum period they would turn the visa around in, 15 working days, has become the norm.” Often this means that passports are returned long after a gig has taken place.According to Richard, visa officers “don’t always appreciate that the simple fact an artist is popular in the UK is reason enough that they should want to do a show here”. Duhaney agrees: many of these bands have “played to 40,000 people in their own country. It’s like Robbie Williams going to Ghana and they’re saying: ‘Who are you? Not really sure we can let you in, mate.’” These refusals seem to be more common than ever in the past year, adds Richard. And it is taking its toll on event programming.“We have four bands on reserve just in case of last-minute visa issues, because it happens every year. It’ll happen in the years going forward,” says Duhaney. “This could seriously affect all UK festivals, if this continues.”Alison Phipps, a language professor at Glasgow University and a Unesco chair in refugee integration, says: “It is an extraordinarily difficult thing to bring a musician into the country,” and that “undoubtedly, since 2015, it has got considerably harder”. In 2017, she booked 22 musicians and dancers from Ghana to perform as part of a £2m UK government-funded academic project at Solas festival. At first, 20 were denied visas. “We’ve done this in the past and we’ve never had a problem,” says Phipps, but this time “they received letters and refusals saying that the Home Office did not believe that they were musicians, that they were working with me on this project. We’re funded by the government to do this work, and then the same government refuses us permission to do it.”After appealing, with the help of her local MPs, all but two of Phipps’s invitees were let in. But not before flights had been rebooked for thousands of pounds. Whether it is official or not, Phipps says, “there is a travel ban in place in the UK. What I see constantly is that if you are from the global south, you will be refused almost invariably.”Brian d’Souza, who performs as the musician Auntie Flo, met one of the key collaborators on his next album, Senegal’s Mame n’Diack Seck Thiam, while in Amsterdam. One of their tracks, Mame’s Story, details Seck Thiam’s difficulties getting a visa to perform at a BBC World Service event at the 2017 Edinburgh International festival.“There seems to be a very colonialist attitude when it comes to presuming underlying motivations for the artists I’m trying to book,” says d’Souza. “It’s saying: ‘If they come to the UK, they’ll just end up staying.’ But most of the artists I’ve ever worked with are here to do a job, and then they’re quite happy to go back to their own homes they’re not desperate to come and live in the UK. They are performers, they’re not trying to emigrate.” Examples such as the nine members of the Orchestra of Syrian Musicians, granted asylum in 2017, are in a minority. Most musicians’ work is rooted in where they live, and they have no desire to move – something underlined by often decades of touring without any attempt at illegal immigration.Was Jon Snow right, then, when he said that the hostile environment is in effect for touring musicians? “Perhaps, but it’s hard to say this is deliberate,” says Richard. “From how we see it, most of these problems seem to stem from their processes not working very efficiently.” Jones also suggests that it is down to administrative incompetence, as a result of cost-cutting. “I don’t think there’s someone sitting inside the immigration authority who’s going: ‘Let’s be racist,’” says Jones. “But instead of being a system that isn’t quite working in the face of government cutbacks, and it’s just bumbling inefficiency and a nuisance, it’s become something that’s been perceived in a different light. Because of Brexit and belligerent statements about ‘reclaiming our borders’. Really, this process has been eroding over time.”Brexit rhetoric might not help Britain’s image as a cultural nexus. But how it will exacerbate the current climate for touring musicians – as well as artists of all other kinds – remains to be seen. Richard says it is unlikely to affect those from countries already on the visa list, but what about those from the EU? A recent report published on 26 July by the House of Lords’ European committee about the movement of people in the cultural sector suggested that the government should offer a “multi-country, multi-entry, short-term touring visa for EU citizens,” and vice versa. But changes have already started to come into play on some borders – and without warning. American artists who would once fly to Ireland to play shows and then go on to the UK without an entry visa now require one to enter the UK, says Richard, “whereas if they enter from any other country, they just need a paper permission, not a visa”.What it could mean for the future, he continues, is that “non-EU acts are less likely to play shows in Ireland. Bands may deem that slotting a Dublin show into their tour is too troublesome.”While Jones estimates that fewer tours are likely to be undertaken in the UK by artists needing visas, he says that he won’t be discouraged from booking them. “That sense of keeping international links wide open has never felt more important in my lifetime.” He says a solution would be simply to “trust” the festivals on the permit-free list who have signed up to take responsibility for the artists they have invited to Britain. Others suggest a specialist for the entertainment sector within the Home Office who can distinguish between genuine and non-genuine acts, and an independent organisation who can advise on forms.If the current situation is not reviewed and improved, however, “everything is going to get a lot harder”, says Phipps. “The UK will be isolated.” Artists, she says, “bring us in to a relationship with difference. They play a line of music we’ve not heard before and we welcome it and our lives are enriched – and then we begin to learn it and then we sing it. What we are doing with Brexit, with the closing of the borders, with all of this focus on a hostile environment, is trying to make our lives dull and stupid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b46fb8c0877d3f91570126c2bc91b88e2fa1da4d/0_1784_3641_2184/master/3641.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a995b3b038e3c88cb9d1122bb2a1cbdb","title":"meriel armitages recipe for jackfruit carnitas","story":"Get your hands dirty with these vegan-friendly treats inspired by offerings found in Mexico CityMexican food is all about using your hands, piling up a lot of napkins on the table and getting messy – it takes the formality out of hosting dinner parties and saves on the washing up.

It is Instagram-friendly, has a daft name and is rooted in deep and meaningful culinary history that it plays on in order to fill a need which didn’t exist before.Before you ask – and I did – bubblewrap waffles are indeed named because of their resemblance to the packaging. Every so often Sunny Wu, founder of Bubblewrap in London’s Chinatown, will receive a phone order for a metre-long roll of packaging.It opened in 2015, first as a stall and last year as a bricks and mortar shop. Shortly after opening, Wu lost her voice because she had to explain the history to every customer. Back then, she was selling two a day, sometimes none. Now, over a weekend, it’s hundreds Wu has considered live-tweeting the queue.To understand the egg waffle – to use its proper name – is to understand its provenance. The most commonly held theory suggests egg waffles, or gai daan jai, were street food items first sold in Hong Kong in the early 1950s. They were originally conceived as a way of using up broken eggs, with people adding them to flour, milk and sugar to create a batter. These waffles used to be made on a hexagonal waffle iron and cooked on charcoal. Where they came from before that is open to debate, but Wu believes they were inspired by European waffles – “it was a colony after all” she trills, with some irony – with the recipe travelling and morphing from west to east and back again. When Hong Kong entered its period of economic reform, eating habits branched out – eating waffles became less about survival and more about pleasure.Here, pleasure certainly abounds each warm waffle is rolled into a cone and filled with ice-cream, fruit, sauce and nuts. The taste is akin to a regular waffle, except lighter, with a slightly sweeter crust. The bubbles don’t pop so much as melt. In the past few weeks, Wu created a vegan version, made with linseed instead of egg, and all toppings vegan, too. Bubblewrap sells this vegan variety on Fridays, so as not to contaminate the waffle irons. I have yet to taste a vegan alternative of anything so close to the original. It is slightly softer in texture, but otherwise Wu is either a scientist or a witch.In an age when Instagram is considered to be the first and final symbol of millennial navel-gazing, and “bad vegans” – those who adopt the diet for superficial reasons – are seriously frowned upon, it is refreshing to meet someone who doesn’t seem to care what people think if she embraces both. Wu joined Instagram the year it launched, and has even hallmarked her own shot in which customers hold the bubblewrap up in front of Wardour Street’s Ching dynasty-designed gate, as if the batter alone has been marketed for peak Instagrammability. “Most people order strawberry and Oreo because the colours work,” she says. “Why not?” she shrugs. “It’s fun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d99a6da148be01c5ee8d9a9ef11d45101c644c80/0_0_1048_699/master/1048.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=85d409e5980e0e83b05d2bc93def9c72 1320w","title":"ella mai bood up r and b charts number 1","story":"The singer is the first UK star to top the US R\u0026ampB singles charts since 1992, with Boo’d Up – a retro feelgood smash.

Eighteen months after its release, south London singer Ella Mai’s infectious single, R\u0026ampB throwback Boo’d Up, has gone from being a sleeper hit to the US-conquering song of the summer – last week she became the first British artist to top the US R\u0026ampB charts since Lisa Stansfield in 1992.But when asked to pinpoint a standout moment from her song’s rise to US radio dominance, Mai’s response is decidedly level-headed. “It’s the way it’s steadily progressed,” she says, speaking from LA. She giddily reels off chart positions in the song’s ascent to its current eight-week reign in the US Top 10 as if she is still pinching herself. “For a purely R\u0026ampB song with no featured artists,” she says, “that’s insane.”With its puppy-love lyrics, Boo’d Up is a rose-tinted trip back to a time when a Friday night canoodling at the local arcade was dating goals, and the only right-swiping was at a Tesco checkout. Over a beat that sounds like a lost classic from SWV or Xscape, Mai’s swooning vocals transpose teenage heart-flutters into the chorus’s giddily onomatopoeic hook, on which she scats: “Ba-dum, boo’d up Biddy-da-dum, boo’d up.” Among the sharp-edged trap and hip-hop that dominates today’s playlists, Mai’s laid-back style is a welcome rush of nostalgia, like the first sip of Ribena on a summer’s day.She says it makes her “super proud” to represent the UK, but her US dominance is yet to be replicated in her birthplace. That is partly because Mai lives in LA, where she is signed to hip-hop heavyweight DJ Mustard’s 10 Summers label. But also, “the music industry in England doesn’t really know what to do with R\u0026ampB,” Mai says. “If it were up to England, Boo’d Up definitely wouldn’t be where it is now.”Despite Britain’s rich history of soul artists, pure R\u0026ampB can often feel sidelined. A new wave of artists such as Mabel and Jorja Smith have scored their biggest hits by leaning into Afro bashment and UK garage, while the slightly more retro grooves of Etta Bond, Mahalia, and NAO don’t get the mainstream love they deserve.Growing up in Wimbledon Chase and Mitcham in south-west London, Mai’s mum gave her a love of music, and would play Mary J Blige, Lauryn Hill, and old jazz records around the house. When she got a teaching job in New York City, her daughter, then 12, joined her and moved to the city’s Queens neighbourhood, before returning to the UK at 17 and studying at London’s BIMM music college. At 19, she auditioned for The X Factor with a couple of mates, performing a well-crafted, if unmemorable, cover of a Little Mix ballad. She first truly found her audience on Instagram, belting out soulful takes of Drake and Kanye West hits. “That was a huge part of building my fanbase,” Mai says. “I had no makeup on my hair looked crazy. I was just being myself: the girl next door.”Mai strengthened those connections to fans with sincere songs about self-acceptance, and biting kiss-offs (“I hope the next girl you love ends up fucking you over,” she sneered on one early track). On Boo’d Up’s parent EP, Ready, tracks are linked by straight-talking interludes aimed at a partner, like Destiny Child’s The Writing’s On the Wall for the WhatsApp generation. But for older audiences, Mai’s retro-leaning style can summon decades-old musical memories. “I can press play on Boo’d Up and reminisce,” says Marsha Ambrosius, a solo R\u0026ampB artist formerly of millennium-era duo Floetry. “I can put my hair in a pineapple up-do, gel down fingerwaves at the side, and feel like it’s 1996. Among all the current madness, you just wanna listen to something that makes you feel good again.”That feeling may be too irresistible for the UK to pass up. On this week’s midweek singles chart, Boo’d Up jumped from 78 to 56, and it was added to Radio 1’s C-list last week, meaning it will be played around eight times a week. “People request it all he time,” says DJ Ace, who runs an R\u0026ampB show on BBC 1Xtra. “I was recently in Ibiza, and that was the number one record that women wanted to hear in the club.”As her next single Trip is released this week, Mai wants Boo’d Up to be a success in the UK: for herself, sure, but also to prove R\u0026ampB’s deserved place at the heart of UK music. “There’s a place for R\u0026ampB in the UK industry, a huge market,” she says. “I hope that Boo’d Up can be a testament to the fact. Sometimes, it takes you moving outside the box to prove that it can be done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e952ddad3c63baa33a6bd1f62f7ff42c31fbe9a/147_80_2085_1250/master/2085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3c72284beddf93f9940b46c381ecbc3","title":"is compassion fatigue inevitable in an age of 24 hour news","story":"We have never been more aware of the appalling events that occur around the world every day. But in the face of so much horror, is there a danger that we become numb to the headlines – and does it matter if we do? By  Elisa GabbertIn April this year, a woman calling herself Apathetic Idealist wrote to an advice columnist at the New York Times, asking for help in overcoming a sense of political paralysis. This condition, which was keeping her from engaging in “real action”, began in November 2016, when Donald Trump won the US presidential election. “I continue to be outraged by this administration’s treatment of Latinos, Native Americans, Muslims, LGBT folks, women and so many others,” she wrote. “But I’m struggling to summon a response.”“I have no doubt that many people can relate to your letter. I can relate to it,” began the response from the columnist, Roxane Gay. “It is damn hard to expand the limits of our empathy when our emotional attention is already stretched too thin.”This seems to be an increasingly common condition. Glance at Twitter or Facebook, and you’ll probably see someone say, “I’m so tired”. There is so much bad news that it feels like we’re running out of emotions. I can relate to Apathetic Idealist, too. For the past several months, I have experienced a creeping psychic exhaustion. “I’m in a numb period,” I tell my friends when they send me frantic texts about the day’s events or ask me how I’m holding up.It wasn’t always like this. In the months after Trump’s election, my husband, John, printed out the phone numbers of our government representatives in Colorado, where we live, and stuck them on the fridge. We started calling them weekly, demanding, even begging them to fight on our behalf – to defend the Americans with Disabilities Act, to fight the attacks on minorities and immigrants and trans people, to fight for gun control. They were supposed to be working for us, weren’t they? My heart would beat faster as I made these calls, trying to translate my anger and fear into something coherent.Sometimes the public outcry seemed to work. A rushed Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act – a flawed but important step toward universal healthcare, established under Barack Obama – failed to find support. It felt like a victory. But a few months later, those same senators cut billions from government healthcare programmes under the guise of “tax reform”. I made a number of calls to my representatives about the tax plan, but it didn’t help this time, the Republicans in Congress had enough votes to pass their plan into law.I haven’t called my senators in months. It was starting to feel like a waste of time and energy. On most occasions, our Republican senator’s office doesn’t even answer the phone. Most of the time, outrage itself feels largely useless. Stay mad, social media activists like to say. How hard is it to stay mad, I remember thinking last year – just watch 20 seconds of any news clip. But it did, in fact, get hard to stay mad. The news is still horrifying, at home and around the world I know this intellectually, but the physical feeling of horror is gone.There’s a clinical name for what Apathetic Idealist and many of us are feeling: it’s called compassion fatigue. Psychologist Charles Figley defines compassion fatigue as “a state of exhaustion and dysfunction, biologically, physiologically and emotionally, as a result of prolonged exposure to compassion stress”. Symptoms include behavioural changes (becoming easily startled, a reduced ability to remain objective), physical changes (exhaustion, anxiety and cardiac symptoms) and emotional changes (numbness, depression, “decreased sense of purpose”). It is an important framework in professions such as nursing, where over-exposure to trauma can lead to health problems for the nurses and worsened outcomes for patients. But it can and has been applied to the general population, too, especially when we are saturated with pleas for attention.Though the term is relatively new, the idea of compassion fatigue has been around for centuries. As historian Samuel Moyn recently put it: “Compassion fatigue is as old as compassion.” And the anxieties that come with our awareness of compassion fatigue go back just as far. According to Moyn, the 18th-century philosophers and moralists who “rooted ethics in sentiment and sympathy” were simultaneously troubled that “devoting oneself to an ethic of exposure and sensitivity to others’ suffering (or of engagement and action to relieve it) might lead to a numbed ethical sense”. It was partly this worry that emotional fatigue could undermine our morals that led Immanuel Kant to abandon sentimentalism for an ethics based in reason – a more objective alternative, at least in theory.The debate around the value of compassion has continued into the 21st century. There are those who argue, following Kant, that a subjective experience of empathy should not be required for moral action, and those who go further, contending that empathy actually gets in the way of morality. But the more commonly held view today seems to be that empathy is vitally necessary, not just for direct human interaction, but as a spur to solve the world’s most pressing problems. Why would we come to the aid of people who are suffering, the thinking goes, if we don’t on some level feel their suffering, too?If it is true that empathy is a necessary motivator for making the world a better place, what happens when we feel bombarded every day with the details of local and global disasters, with every shocking crime, political scandal and climate calamity here and abroad? The war in Syria. Refugee crises. Melting sea ice. Professionals on the frontlines of trauma are trained to watch for signs of “compassion fatigue”, but lately it feels as if everyone is at risk. After a year of news addiction that left me with insomnia and heart palpitations, I’m starting to detach. Is there any way around it? What happens when the world wants more empathy than we can give?The term “compassion fatigue” first appeared in print in a 1992 article by the writer and historian Carla Joinson. While observing nurses in emergency departments, Joinson noticed “a unique form of burnout that affects people in the caregiving profession”. A nurse named Jackie had recently lost her favourite patient, despite “desperate efforts” to save her. Afterwards, Jackie had complained of “lingering feelings of helplessness and anger”. Likewise, a surgical nurse named Marian reported going through a period of “despair and frustration” that almost drove her to leave the profession – until she started to practise a kind of strategic remove.Before it had an official name, something similar to compassion fatigue had been recognised in medical literature. By 1980, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders claimed “knowing of others’ traumas can be traumatising”. Though it was not yet well defined, there was a sense that proximity to trauma could itself be damaging, like secondhand smoke.In the early 90s, Figley explored these ideas further. He identified how professionals providing “empathic support” to people with post-traumatic stress disorder can themselves begin to exhibit some of the same symptoms as their patients, such as anxiety and other emotional changes. According to Figley, trauma spreads to people who work in areas such as healthcare – not only because they are more likely to be exposed to those who are traumatised, but because caring is often inherent to their sense of self: empathy as a liability. Figley, who had served in Vietnam, went on to adopt and popularise Joinson’s term, and became a major advocate for compassion fatigue awareness.If you have ever cared for a sick parent, or child, you might recognise the symptoms of increased stress: the bad sleep, bad moods, bad stomach. I have experienced compassion fatigue as a caregiver myself. My husband has a chronic illness, and when he started getting ill, several years ago, we didn’t know what was wrong. He would be struck with sudden vertigo and trapped on the couch, panicked, for hours. On other days, he was too dizzy to drive, or too unsteady to walk without a cane. Even more worryingly, his hearing started fluctuating, the levels changing from day to day, sometimes better in one ear and worse in the other. This made his work particularly difficult – he was teaching at a university at the time. Throughout it all, he had roaring tinnitus, which he compared to hair dryers, vacuum cleaners, jet engines, sirens, and on one occasion, a UFO landing. Some days he could barely hear anything, and it seemed that any day, he might wake up with no hearing at all, unable to work or communicate, even with me. John was in his 30s.Because he couldn’t reliably drive or talk on the phone, I became John’s assistant, ferrying him to class when he was well enough to teach, cancelling his classes when he couldn’t leave the house, calling doctors and insurance companies, driving to appointments. I still had a full-time job, too. I hated these new and sudden demands on my time and energy, but I hated even more how easily frustrated I would get. If he asked for help when I was busy, I would snap at him, then feel awful about it. Many nights we stayed up late, exhausted we lay in the dark side by side, worrying and arguing.“Stress” doesn’t quite capture this era in our marriage we felt terror and despair. I was afraid for John, yes, but I also felt alone, starved of compassion. I remember thinking (and maybe saying, shamefully) that I wanted someone to take care of me. I was pouring all my emotional resources toward John, and it seemed that he was hoarding his, spending all his feeling on himself. (And wasn’t that natural? Aren’t there times when we deserve to collect, rather than pay out, sympathy?) Studies have shown that stress, anxiety and uncertainty can reduce our levels of empathy. But it felt more like my empathy was being used up faster, due to greater demand.The effects of compassion fatigue on healthcare workers are real and documented. Left untreated, it leads to reduced quality of care, an increase in clinical errors, and high employee turnover. Caregivers take these symptoms home, as well, harming their relationships with friends and family. Accordingly, caregivers are instructed to monitor themselves for signs of compassion fatigue. A textbook authored by Figley includes self-assessments to test your “ego resiliency”, “self-compassion” and “post-traumatic growth” – that is, the “positive changes that some trauma survivors report as a result of the struggle to cope with traumatic events”. In the US, there seems to be a fixation on these positive narratives thus, after a terrorist attack or similar disaster, some will claim it has made them “stronger than ever” – the Hollywood ending for real-world trauma.Caregivers are coached to follow various established guidelines of self-care in order to ward off compassion fatigue, or to recover if it has already struck. These include physical, psychological and social commitments such as maintaining healthy eating and sleeping habits, making time for relaxation and meditation, and building a social support network, including at least two people who can be counted on to be “highly supportive”. If trauma is communicable, one hopes those supporters have a support network of their own.“On any given workday, I’m interacting with many people who are literally having the worst days of their lives,” says an acquaintance of mine who works as a hospice nurse. But she is conscious of the risk of giving any one patient or family too much of her attention and energy. “I don’t try to put myself in my patients’ shoes or try to feel what they’re feeling – although this sometimes happens anyway,” she told me. “I need to maintain my emotional endurance by not using it all up in my first years of being a nurse.”My day job is nowhere near that harrowing I work in marketing. But when I try to keep up the work of an informed citizen, I too feel that my emotional endurance is being tested. There’s a sticky note on the wall by my desk that says: “BE AN ACTIVIST.” It has been there so long that I hardly see it anymore. I worry sometimes that I haven’t paced my outrage.Not long after compassion fatigue emerged as a concept in healthcare, a similar concept began to appear in media studies – the idea that overexposure to horrific images, from news reports in particular, could cause viewers to shut down emotionally, rejecting information instead of responding to it. In her 1999 book Compassion Fatigue: How the Media Sell Disease, Famine, War and Death, the journalist and scholar Susan Moeller explored this idea at length. “It seems as if the media careen from one trauma to another, in a breathless tour of poverty, disease and death,” she wrote. “The troubles blur. Crises become one crisis.” The volume of bad news drives the public to “collapse into a compassion fatigue stupor”.Susan Sontag grappled with similar questions in her short book Regarding the Pain of Others, published in 2003. By “regarding” she meant not just “with regard to”, but looking at: “Flooded with images of the sort that once used to shock and arouse indignation, we are losing our capacity to react. Compassion, stretched to its limits, is going numb. So runs the familiar diagnosis.” She implies that the idea was already tired: media overload dulls our sensitivity to suffering. Whose fault is that – ours or the media’s? And what are we supposed to do about it?By Moeller’s account, compassion fatigue is a vicious cycle. When war and famine are constant, they become boring – we’ve seen it all before. The only way to break through your audience’s boredom is to make each disaster feel worse than the last. When it comes to world news, the events must be “more dramatic and violent” to compete with more local stories, as a 1995 study of international media coverage by the Pew Research Center in Washington found.Advert-supported media channels survive on attention, and this leads to sensationalism and images meant to shock: starving, bloated children, cities ravaged by war. But these images, by design, are upsetting, and eventually we turn away – a form of self-preservation. And when a story isn’t hot any more – that often meant low newspaper sales in the 90s now it would be judged by a lack of clicks – the media tends to move on. As Tom Kent, a former international editor with the Associated Press, tells Moeller: “We cover things until there’s not much new to say.” In other words, crises often get boring before they get better.In 1991, Moeller says, Americans focused more on cyclones and earthquakes than other, slower global crises, such as famine in Africa, because they saw the natural disasters as “one-shot problems with specific solutions”. There were clear ways to help, finite amounts of aid that would make a substantial difference. Famine, on the other hand, had been going on for years, despite it being a cause célèbre in the 80s, when benefit concerts and charity records had raised tens of millions of dollars of humanitarian aid. For many people, it had probably come to seem like an intractable crisis.The fact that coverage of slowly unfolding, complex disasters tends to be limited is a problem that the public aren’t interested is another. But there may be a good reason for both, beyond moral decrepitude. Numbness or indifference to real atrocity may, from the outside, seem callous. But as Figley has argued, compassion fatigue, in the medical sense, stems from a desire to help. There is no compassion fatigue without compassion: the caregivers at risk see somebody suffering, and they want to reduce that suffering. But they can’t always succeed. Compassion fatigue, then, is stymied compassion.If caregivers are at risk because they give care to the traumatised, then empathetic news consumers are at risk because they consume the news. Just opening Twitter on your phone, or looking at the TV in a bar, exposes you to enormous problems you can’t possibly solve. Perhaps you can help, but the difference that an inidual contribution makes – placing a call, voting, going to a protest – often feels imperceptible.Compassion is generally seen as pure virtue, but is it always selfless? In The Science of Evil, psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen cites multiple studies that reveal an “empathy circuit” in the brain. These are the parts of the brain that usually activate when, for example, we look at a needle piercing someone else’s hand – the psychology-experiment version of watching the scene in Un Chien Andalou, Luis Buñuel’s surrealist film in which a man appears to slice through a woman’s eyeball with a razor. (It’s actually a sheep’s eye.) I cringe and look away because on some automatic level I imagine it happening to me. In some sense, having empathy is a way of feeling compassion for myself.Human propensity to empathy, Baron-Cohen claims, much like height and other traits, follows a normal distribution, the so-called bell curve. This means that a select few people have extraordinarily high levels of empathy – he offers anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu as an example – while some at the other end of the curve have zero empathy, including people with narcissistic personality disorder and psychopaths. (My mother once told me she had read that the two professions that test highest for psychopathy are surgeons and Buddhist monks – presumably because both require detachment. It sounds like dubious science, but does suggest another way in which empathy can be a liability: a barrier to objectivity or enlightenment.) The fact that most people are in the middle of the curve, Baron-Cohen writes, suggests that “moderate empathy levels are most adaptive”. Most adaptive for what, we might ask – proliferation of the species, or good ethics? And are policies that favour local proliferation actively harmful to populations farther away?Average empathy will fail some of the time we will fail to feel what others are feeling, as the hospice nurse I know put it, even if we try. And this may be a rational response, whether conscious or automatic. Empathy, like any bodily process, has a cost. Hunger would be meaningless if it didn’t make you eat. What good is compassion if it doesn’t translate into concrete, external action? Perhaps it is rational to cut off the supply of emotion if it amounts to wasted energy.Can compassion fatigue be avoided, given our unprecedented access to appalling events around the world at every moment? Searching for solutions to apathy in the age of daily mass shootings, I found an article by a family therapist, written in November 2017:The therapist identifies his victim-blaming reaction as a classic case of compassion fatigue, then outlines some solutions to the syndrome. First, the therapist suggests it is necessary to “personalise the tragedy”. “Read the stories of each of the dead and connect with them as people, not nameless victims. This simple act of reading their stories can maintain compassion and protect us from apathy.” (Can it, I wonder? This could be effective for any given mass shooting, but if we read up on the victims of every mass shooting, won’t the hundreds of details begin to blur together?) Secondly: “Be outraged … Don’t give into the desire to withdraw.” (This seems like telling someone the solution to cancer is “don’t have cancer”.) And third: “If you are still feeling burnt out emotionally, look for a tragedy closer to home.”This last tip struck me as particularly inane, as though compassion were an end in itself. Shouldn’t we fight compassion fatigue because we worry that paralysis and apathy will make the world worse? I don’t hope to increase my empathy for its own sake, especially by way of nearby tragedies. In any case, the tragedies are there – my husband’s condition has been diagnosed, but that’s what he would call a pyrrhic victory the condition is deteriorating and has no known cure. I have a friend whose wife is dying of cancer he has had to pay for her treatment through crowdfunding campaigns. This isn’t unusual. Everyone has their own local tragedy.Moeller claims compassion fatigue is not inevitable, and that the media can fight it by providing coverage that is neither formulaic nor sensationalised. “More graphic is not better,” she writes. Sontag, for her part, believed fatigue was a reasonable response to a barrage of terrible images: “Someone who is perennially surprised that depravity exists, who continues to feel disillusioned (even incredulous) when confronted with evidence of what humans are capable of inflicting in the way of gruesome, hands-on cruelties upon other humans, has not reached moral or psychological adulthood.” In this view, compassion fatigue is a coming of age.On the other hand, if we feel entitled to apathy, or even self-righteous about our apathy, it can become an easy excuse for moral laziness. In 2000, the New Yorker published a cartoon that showed two men in suits walking past a disgruntled-looking homeless man asking for money. One suit says to the other: “Here I was, all this time, worrying that maybe I’m a selfish person, and now it turns out I’ve been suffering from compassion fatigue.”I have reached the point where being shocked feels normal it is a fact I hold in my mind but don’t feel in my body. I would like to follow the guidelines of self-care, to preserve my “emotional endurance”, not as a professional caregiver, just as a regular person who cares about the world. So I take breaks and try to reduce my stress. I go out with friends, I watch old poker tournaments on YouTube. But my breaks are getting longer. They feel dangerously close to avoidance.That distance is better, I suppose, than feeling hopelessly enraged. But what is my responsibility? How much am I supposed to know about global suffering, and what can I really do with that knowledge? Social media, 24-hour news, alerts on my phone – the demands on our compassion are much higher than a caveman or Kant had to contend with. It is overwhelming, even paralysing, and very likely makes me less effectual in the local spaces where I might actually be able to do some good. Whether or not I keep up with everything happening everywhere, all the time, I know that the information exists that awareness alone is fatiguing. It’s very easy to succumb to fatalism, which is perhaps the logical extension of compassion fatigue – believing that we’re screwed no matter what we do is mysteriously tempting.Do we need to feel bad in order to do good? The psychologist Paul Bloom, who wrote a book called Against Empathy, argues – or perhaps hopes – that we can be moral without depending on empathy, which is biased and unreliable. We shouldn’t dole out aid in accordance with the amount of sympathy we feel for people we should help the people who need the most help. The answer, in Bloom’s mind, is not to dial up our sympathy for everyone to unsustainable levels, but dial it down so we can approach problems more logically. Even Baron-Cohen, who equates “empathy erosion” with evil, concedes that there are people with zero empathy who are also rigidly moral they do it by systematising right and wrong. This seems to prove that good ethics don’t depend on the feeling of empathy. However, most of us are not that systematic. On New Year’s Day in 2017, John and I invited an activist we know over for dinner, an older man with much more experience in organising than us. While they talked and planned, I cooked and drank wine and grew maudlin. “Stop despairing!” our friend snapped at me. “That’s not a strategy.”The next time I saw him, a couple of months later, he apologised for having raised his voice and conceded that there are many forms of activism. “Maybe writing can be yours,” he said. I had skipped several public protests in the interim, feeling I had too much other work to do. But I was heartened that people I knew attended. I liked the photos they posted on social media – I felt inspired by the size of the crowds, knowing others had the time and energy to march in the streets for what we all believed.It is comforting to think that when we’re too fatigued to fight, someone else will take the lead. It is, perhaps, too comforting.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eac5d3e651b161db0080be689864f6f7ac38147e/0_0_2749_1649/master/2749.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9b391f314c407dcaf723bbe0e131fad0 1440w","title":"electoral commission drops investigation into dup over brexit spending","story":"Democratic Unionist party faced allegations of breaching spending rules in its pro-Brexit campaignThe Electoral Commission will not investigate the Democratic Unionist party over claims it coordinated its Brexit referendum campaign spending with Vote Leave in order to break legal spending limits.The Northern Irish party, which props up Theresa May’s government in the Commons, had faced a series of allegations about its spending during the 2016 EU referendum, after it spent hundreds of thousands of pounds campaigning to leave the bloc. The DUP’s referendum spending was aided by a £435,000 donation from unknown iniduals, channelled through an organisation run by a former Scottish Conservative parliamentary candidate. The original source of the donation remains unclear, as until recently the law did not require political parties in Northern Ireland to declare their financial backers.The DUP then spent most of its money campaigning outside Northern Ireland, including buying a £280,000 advert in the  newspaper, which is only distributed in Great Britain. The party also paid for targeted Facebook advertising through AggregateIQ, at that time an obscure Canadian social media business, which was at the centre of the illegal campaign coordination between Vote Leave and the campaign group BeLeave, run by the young campaigner Darren Grimes.The Electoral Commission considered the DUP allegations after they were made in a BBC investigation, which alleged the party’s pro-Brexit activity was conducted as part of a common campaign with Vote Leave – enabling the pro-Brexit lobbying group to break spending limits. The regulator has now concluded it “does not have grounds to open an investigation” because it does not have sufficient evidence. A spokesperson confirmed there were no other ongoing investigations into DUP activities during the referendum.The commission has also rejected claims from the Tory MP Priti Patel that the official remain campaign should be investigated for allegedly coordinating spending between various pro-EU groups during the referendum.Edwards said there had to be clear evidence of one pro-EU group directing another on how to spend money in order to prompt an investigation. She said it was legal for campaigners to “use the same suppliers and the same volunteers”, while donors are legally allowed to give to more than one campaign group working for the same cause. However, the Electoral Commission concluded that it would investigate a campaign group called Wake Up And Vote after finding there was “reasonable suspicion” that it may have coordinated its spending with an ad agency to produce a series of videos featuring actors Lily Cole, Keira Knightley and Dominic Cooper urging people to vote.In May the Electoral Commission fined Leave.EU, the pro-Brexit campaign group founded by Arron Banks, £70,000 after finding that it had breached multiple counts of electoral law.Pro-Brexit campaigners have increasingly turned their anger on the commission itself following its ruling against the activities of Leave.EU and Vote Leave. One activist who was fined £250 as part of the investigation into Brexit spending, on Thursday released a film of himself paying the penalty in cash, which he dumped on the floor in the foyer of the Electoral Commission’s central London office.The commission also told Patel, a former cabinet minister, that they were exasperated by the attacks on the organisation’s neutrality with regards to Brexit: “It would be wrong for us to take decisions on the basis that we must balance action in respect of ‘leave’ campaigners with action in respect of ‘remain’ campaigners. That would undermine our neutrality, rather than ensure it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd58c37743c94e259b77f6f8d355e474c13b9c34/194_107_2014_1208/master/2014.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d0e9b5d531558edfc7b9517801f1a1d","title":"improve emergency brake offer to stop brexit says french senator","story":"Jean Bizet says safeguard on migration should be discussed at May-Macron meetingEurope should try to keep the UK in the EU by improving its offer on an emergency brake on the free movement of people, first made before the 2016 referendum, the chair of the French senate’s European committee has said.Jean Bizet was speaking to the  before a meeting between Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May at the French president’s holiday retreat on Friday. Bizet is the first senior French politician to respond to an apparent shift in UK public opinion in favour of a further referendum on the final outcome of the Brexit negotiations.The meeting at Fort Brégançon has been billed as an attempt to explore whether May can persuade Macron to show greater flexibility in the deadlocked Brexit talks than the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. The Élysée stressed on Thursday that the meeting was not intended to undercut Barnier or initiate parallel talks.The remarks by Bizet, an old political ally of Barnier, shows how Macron is under conflicting domestic pressures. The intention is not solely to ease Britain’s EU withdrawal but also to see whether even at this late stage Brexit can be forestalled. Bizet’s committee has just published a report on the Brexit talks warning of a real risk of failure to reach a deal. He said no-deal would represent “collective mutual suicide”.Bizet, expanding on a theme he has raised in the French senate, said it was possible to revive and enhance the idea of an emergency brake on migration, negotiated by David Cameron and Donald Tusk, the EU president, in 2015. “I have no doubt European capitals would accept the introduction of a safeguard clause in which a country closes its borders when the balance of society is judged to be in danger,” he said. “The Tusk package could come back for discussion. It can be a collective effort by the 27 to keep the UK inside the EU. The Tusk package is not a transformation but a modification.”The original proposal negotiated by Cameron allowed for an emergency brake on the payment of in-work benefits. The proposed enhancement would allow for an EU-wide restriction on free movement in an emergency.Bizet, a member of the centre-right Républicains, claimed many senior figures in the European commission and the Visegrád Group of central European countries agreed with this thinking, but it required May to show a willingness to explore the plan. He said he hoped Macron would raise the proposal with May in their private talks. Bizet said he saw little room for an extension of the EU-UK negotiating timetable. He said the best option was for the UK to remain in the EU, but failing that the next best option would be for the UK to adopt a Norway-style arrangement through membership of the European Economic Area.The EEA proposal has recently been adopted in private by the Eurosceptic Michael Gove as a temporary port for the UK from next March, the Brexit deadline, so giving leeway in the transition period for detailed talks on a future trading arrangement. In recent days Gove has said privately that May’s Chequers plan for Brexit may be dead in the water.British ministers have been fanning out across European capitals since the publication of the Chequers plan, warning that a collapse in negotiations would damage not just the UK but also the already stressed EU project before European parliament elections due next May.

Fifteen titles including Olympic gold and silver, plus a stranglehold on the quickest times in history, attested to his supremacy. Hence defeat at the Commonwealth Games – albeit by four-hundredths of a second over 50m by South Africa’s Cameron van der Burgh – felt\u0026nbspseismic.“A reality check,” he said. The subsequent analysis detected a current of fatigue that had been swirling beneath the surface. “I\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspgoing in the water,” he says, “and it was like: ‘I don’t really want to be here.’ I mean, everyone has down days. It’s just the way we’re wired. But when you’re racing, or you’re training 5,000-6,000 metres a\u0026nbspday, it’s just like: ‘Oh, my God, this\u0026nbspis tough.’”Four months later the 23‑year‑old has undergone what he terms a renewal of his motivation, of his application and, of greatest significance, of the fun factor derived from pushing his muscular frame through the mill at dawn and\u0026nbspdusk. “It stopped me from getting bored really,” he says, grinning. “That I can actually be beaten if I’m not in top form, which is an important lesson in itself. But\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspjust want to be the best, and\u0026nbspgoing through the training these\u0026nbsplast few months has been really positive.”Ominous talk, both for those who would seek to dethrone Peaty\u0026nbspcome the 2020 Olympic Games\u0026nbspin Tokyo and for his challengers at the European Championships which begin on Friday in Glasgow. It is a meeting he can view through the prism of nostalgic fondness. The 2014 championships in Berlin were the venue for his maiden world best amid four golds which was repeated two years later in London. They were staging points en\u0026nbsproute to Rio’s glorious pinnacle.Fame and relative fortune followed. It was principally a blessing but had the potential to affect his willpower. His long-time coach, Mel Marshall, has craftily carved time for commercial activities around diligence in gym and pool – and kept Peaty’s quicksilver feet planted on the ground by embedding him in the Sport in Action project Marshall has long supported in Zambia.The pair have cycled together on a fundraising tour. More recently, Peaty has persuaded sponsors to finance a sports centre in the capital, Lusaka, with pitches for football and courts for basketball that double as havens from the mania outside.“That’s obviously in an enclosed area,” he says. “So it’s not going to be used for gangs, it’s not going to be\u0026nbspused for crime, drugs, alcohol, it’s\u0026nbspnot going to be used for any of that. It’s guarded so people can’t steal the equipment. And the place it was built on was a place where people had been raped, been killed, so it’s a turnaround of the community, the local people out there, and it gives the kids a safe place to go.“We’re lucky enough to be born in the United Kingdom but even more lucky to have these facilities. It just put everything into perspective when you moan about something. It’s like: ‘Shouldn’t be really moaning about that.’”Amid the philanthropy Peaty has\u0026nbsptreated himself to a few rewards for his labours. One of the two Mercedes he acquired to feed his adrenaline has been sold but his favourite, a twin-turbo S63 AMG, remains. “The faster I swim, the more I can get of them,” he says, smiling. Expect the realisation of his grand project, to be the first man to dip under 57 seconds for the 100m breaststroke, to result in another trip to the dealership.But do not expect advancements in Glasgow, he cautions – merely medals. “I’m still at about an eight probably on an emotional level this year, not investing too much.” That is further along the scale than\u0026nbspGold Coast but a long way from the perfect 10 he will demand of himself at the Tokyo Olympics. “The methodology is one: to keep enjoying it. That might sound a bit\u0026nbspcringey but it is all about how much can you enjoy it and get the best out of it.“And two: people only burn out because they forget the reason why they do it. And that’s the most important thing. I don’t really like the term burnout. Because it’s almost, if you’re burning out, then you shouldn’t even be doing it.” Peaty’s fire, reassuringly, is flaming brightly again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d71ecdbda5e2b7dd27fd6315ffba1486377acd10/25_168_2446_1467/master/2446.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b5c4567654f0bbc65679e0f1283abc8","title":"england india first test day two match report","story":"• England 287 \u0026amp 9-1, India 274• Captain hits 149 before Cook falls for duck to end day twoVirat Kohli, the single-handed hero, produced the innings of a lifetime to keep his side in what has become a wonderfully volatile game of cricket. India’s captain began myopically under examination from Jimmy Anderson but finished majestically against any bowler summoned up by Joe Root. His innings of 149 ned three sessions and lasted 225 balls and without it India’s chances of victory in this Test match would have long disappeared. The next highest score in India’s 274 all out was Shikhar Dhawan’s 26.Kohli’s imperious strokeplay in the evening sunshine was all too familiar, yet in a sense the most impressive element of his innings was his early struggle against Anderson, who dismissed him cheaply so often four years ago. Here he displayed the humility of a great player. There were no flowery strokes against Anderson. He was hellbent on no more than survival. He was prepared to graft like a mortal. Anderson kept probing, Kohli kept prodding. Ostensibly not much happened and yet this was a riveting, high-class contest from which both players emerged with credit.But in the end it was Kohli’s day. Thanks to him England’s first-innings lead was restricted to 13 when it might have been 130. Then to the tourists’ delight Alastair Cook was bowled for a duck by another perfect off-break from his tormentor, Ravi Ashwin, the last act of a day of vivid entertainment and the fall of 12 wickets.Initially a clatter of wickets seemed unlikely once England’s first innings had been polished off without delay. After eight overs of India’s innings the ball, which declined to deviate, was tossed to umpire Gaffaney, who soon threw it back to Root. At the start of the 14th over England tried their luck at the other end with umpire Dar. After a polite glance at the ball he also declined any overtures to change it.Then Sam Curran found enough swing to hit Murali Vijay’s front pad. England had already wasted one review but they were convinced enough to try again and this time their request was justified. From here onwards there were no further attempts to change the ball. It had started swinging – just enough – for Curran. His next delivery to KL Rahul produced an edged boundary. Then Curran propelled a wide half-volley, which may have swung a smidgen a wayward drive and the ball ricocheted on to the stumps. Che Pujara might have left that one.In Curran’s next over there was enough swing to find the edge of Dhawan’s bat, especially since the left-hander was seduced into playing an airy drive despite the loss of two wickets in three balls. At the other end Kohli began his fascinating duel with Anderson.Curran had found significant movement at a modest pace. After lunch Ben Stokes swung the ball rather more quickly. His 10-over spell should have produced more than two wickets. Ajinkya Rahane would have been lbw had England reviewed but this mattered little since he soon hung out his bat and was caught at third slip by Keaton Jennings. Dinesh Karthik disappeared as rapidly as his middle stump, which cartwheeled towards the city centre.India were suddenly 100 for five and on the ropes but now England missed their chance to take charge of the game. They could not help the fact that Hardik Pandya successfully reviewed an lbw decision off Stokes but then two slip catches were spilt from consecutive deliveries. Most crucially Dawid Malan, at second slip, dropped Kohli, who had a mere 21 at the time, off Anderson. The next ball, which was delivered by Stokes, was edged by Pandya to Cook at first slip and that chance was spilt as well. Suddenly England’s hands were no more trustworthy than those of the ECB’s chairman on the first morning.Soon Kohli had surpassed his highest score in England (39) and was batting ever more fluently. He added 48 with Pandya, who was lbw to Curran when the ball struck his boot just before his bat. Kohli reached his half-century from 100 balls, whereupon he had another reprieve from Malan, although this was the toughest of chances away to the fielder’s right hand side.After tea Anderson was rewarded for his earlier efforts when he bowled Ashwin and dismissed Mohammed Shami, caught at second slip by Malan. This was no more than he deserved. By contrast Stuart Broad struggled, not so much for pace but movement. He is an analytical cricketer and will recognise that he would have bowled more than 10 overs in the innings if he had been on song.Now Kohli was like a solitary puppet master, pulling all the strings. He dominated the strike and removed the hand brake with a sequence of silky boundaries against a tiring attack. After the adhesive Ishant Sharma was lbw to Adil Rashid’s googly (though the ball was shown to be missing leg stump on a day when the umpires too often proved fallible) he calmly square-cut Stokes to register his 22nd Test century and one of his best.The last two Indian wickets added 92 runs, of which Sharma contributed five runs and Umesh Yadav one. Eventually Kohli was caught at backward point off Rashid seeking the strike and his 150th run. By then he had rescued his team and buried a few demons along the way.

That the course opens with a par three provides such opportunity. Hall’s first tee shot, to within a foot of the hole, was duly backed up. Her Thursday round of 67 – five under par and bogey-free – raises the prospect of only a third British success in this event since it was afforded major status in 2001.Hall will hope location carries deeper meaning: the last such victory, by Catriona Matthew in 2009, was at Lytham.Hall finished third in this event a year ago. Then, as now, the Englishwoman opted not to use her standard caddie, her boyfriend, Harry, with her father, Wayne, taking on bag‑carrying duties.“He knew about it in about March,” Hall said of the disappointment for Harry. “Dad’s done it for the last four or five years and he did the Scottish Open as well it is our thing. Harry was OK, he gets to do all the rest of the tournaments.”More pertinent, perhaps, was the dinner Hall shared with the former European Tour player turned analyst Ken Brown at the start of the week. “We were talking about when he played here and he walked nine holes with me on Wednesday,” Hall said.The 22-year-old Hall also welcomed the concept of pressure over the coming three days. “Because that means I’m doing OK,” she said. “It is the British Open. I expect some pressure.”Australia’s Minjee Lee, who lost out on a playoff at the Scottish Open on Sunday after missing a three-foot putt at the 72nd, set the early pace with a 65. Mamiko Higa of Japan is only one adrift.Matthew, playing in the company of Lee, signed for a 71. Charley Hull played the closing four holes in two under in matching Matthew’s score. Florentyna Parker’s 69 was most notable for a hole in one at the 9th. “I was two over par so you think: ‘Just hit the green’ because you’re not playing great,” Parker said. “It was a quite short hole, downwind. My caddie said eight iron. I wasn’t sure, seven or eight, since the wind was strong.“I hit my eight iron and I was like: ‘Phew, I got it on the green.’ It was directing towards the pin and bounced, I think, a few times, and then it just disappeared. It was amazing. I’ve now had three but that’s my first in a major.”A rapid improvement in the weather after a squally morning on the Lancashire coast was reflected in the scoring. Yu Liu was one of few to make progress as the wind swirled and rain battered down before taking a triple-bogey seven at the last for a 69. On the same hole, Shanshan Feng thinned a shot from a greenside bunker but watched her ball, remarkably, hit the pin before flying back to a decent position. Feng duly chipped in for a par four before providing the uncontrollable laugh which perfectly described the absurdity of the situation.Michelle Wie’s appearance lasted only 12 holes. From the position of seven over par she withdrew citing a hand problem.“I have been doing everything humanly possible this past couple of weeks to get my hand healthy enough to play this event,” she said. “Unfortunately it wasn’t enough. I gave it my all today but I just couldn’t handle the pain any longer.”A penny for the thoughts of Paula Creamer, the first reserve who would have been given a place in the field had Wie not started her round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe19017c001ef3875d73d7bb3fe8a3aea602e5c/0_295_5675_3405/master/5675.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51dd1bc383ce83b902306f14d469d4fa","title":"lies review almeida theatre","story":"Almeida, LondonThis ingenious high-stakes show uncovers the psychology of those whose financial flutters shook the worldIn place of the Almeida theatre’s rows of tip-back seats are 10 semicircular gaming tables, each with a curve of seven stools. Though it is common to reorganise an auditorium to suit a show, £￥€$ (Lies), by the Belgian group Ontoerend Goed, removes any sense of a standard playhouse or, indeed, play.Thirteen black-clad performers serve as croupiers or financial advisers, but the busiest participants are the 70 ticketholders. Groups at each table form a bank and trade on global markets by gambling with poker chips.The experience most resembles an extreme game of Monopoly. Different rounds are ingeniously designed to offer more return for greater risk, and, on the bong of a gong, complications are presented, such as shorting, mergers and foreign bonds.One possible false note is that all institutions are expected to pay full tax to the central bank. One member of our team, showing what might be called an Amazonian attitude to her balance sheet, was punished by having to play for a while with special “naughty dice”. Potential objections to the project are that our interventions in the global economy are a matter of gambler’s luck rather than skill and that, as we are not playing with real money or consequences, the jeopardy is theoretical. However, a common critique of the financial industry is that it depends more on casino throws than economic theory, and many of those involved in the 2008 bank crashes admitted losing sight of the fact that they were playing with real lives and livelihoods. So the underlying unreality is the point. Though revealing nothing about the blackjack table of capitalism that wasn’t in the play Enron or the film The Big Short, the power of the show is that it immerses the audience in the psychology of those whose flutters shook the world. Early in the two-hour gameplay, a cautious investment strategy starts to seem boring, and competition with better-performing banks encourages ever-riskier punts and loans. We are tellingly experiencing a mindset that is played for real on global markets.• There are two nightly performances of £￥€$ (Lies) at Almeida theatre, London, until 18 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/586c45daad5eb19901fabc507895bceba602b286/76_53_2913_1749/master/2913.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0bd34067afc861982a1d06c640d2c1f","title":"macs ipods apps how apple revolutionised technology","story":"Over 42 years, the company has created an ‘app economy’ and placed itself at the centre of itFew companies change the world, and fewer still do it more than once. Apple is one of them, with a string of products over its 42-year history that have revolutionised computing, upended industries and ultimately reshaped society.The company’s first computer, the Apple I, sold a few hundred units, barely enough to make an impression on a small high school. But its 1977 follow-up, the Apple II, was a different story. The innovations of the Apple II were so influential that it is hard to even see them as such today. The computer was housed in a sleek plastic case, modelled more on kitchen appliances than its predecessors in the microcomputing world.A built-in keyboard made input a dream, while an RF jack allowed owners to plug it into a standard television for output, making the Apple II a “ready-to-run” machine. And the whole thing cost “just” $1,298 – a shade under £4,000 today.It was enough to make the machine the workhorse of Apple’s lineup for more than five years. Almost problematically so: Apple’s attempts to replace the Apple II, such as the Apple III, or the Lisa, an early (expensive) example of a computer with a graphic user interface, struggled to take off. In the end, it took until 1984, when the company launched the Macintosh, for it to stumble upon a worthy successor.New industries turned to the technology, with Apple gaining a reputation in desktop publishing and digital art that it has held through to the present day. In 1987, Quark Inc released its QuarkXpress page layout software exclusively for the Macintosh. In 1990, Adobe Systems released Photoshop, exclusively for the Macintosh. In 1985, a year after the Macintosh was released, the software company Aldus released PageMaker, a desktop publishing program, again exclusively for the Macintosh. PageMaker was bought by Adobe and ultimately replaced by Adobe’s InDesign in 1999. InDesign is the software used to lay out the  today – and it is still on a Mac.Even by the time of the Macintosh, Apple’s strengths were becoming clear. The company was not the trailblazer: the Apple II was not the first microcomputer, and the Macintosh was not the first with a GUI.Instead, it was the company that brought concepts to the mainstream. And that is what it did almost 20 years after the Macintosh, with the product that remade Apple and put it on the path to becoming the world’s first trillion-dollar company: the iPod.When the iPod was first announced in 2001 the reaction from much of the technology press was apathetic. “No wireless. Less space than a Nomad. Lame,” was the verdict of Rob “CmdrTaco” Malda, the founder of the influential tech site Slashdot.MP3 players already existed, such as Malda’s Nomad Jukebox, and they were technically better, with larger hard drives, replaceable batteries, and compatibility with both Windows and Mac (the iPod would take another year to come to Windows). What did Apple have to offer?With hindsight, the answer is obvious. The iPod looked cool: it had a sleek aluminium shell half the size of its competitors, and a physical scroll wheel that could zoom through the trademark “1,000 songs in your pocket”. The iPod revolutionised Apple’s fortunes, kicking off a five-fold increase in its share price over the following five years, and providing a gateway drug for winning round Windows users to its Mac ecosystem. But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer.In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc. That same day, it also announced something else: the iPhone.Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder and chief executive at the time, revealed the iPhone to the world as three products in one: “A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communications device.”And for a while, that was all it was. But it was enough: the device sold out across the US when it launched in June that year – even at its initial launch price of $499 with a two-year contract. But the real revolution came a year later – almost exactly 10 years ago today –when Apple launched the App Store. If the iPhone was three products in one before the App Store, then on 10 July 2008 it did not become four products in one, or five it became 500, one for each new app available on the store on release day. Suddenly, the iPhone was a games console and an image editor, and a musical instrument and a torch. Apple is not just changing an industry: it is changing the world, reshaping it into an “app economy” and planting itself in the middle of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/321378c8162ce5c45b13d3f7cb3d4016615c5f70/0_79_1180_708/master/1180.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2d48668293d92ae55d5af846f8fb720","title":"which thinkpad buy t480 x1 carbon replace macbook air","story":"AB wants a new laptop for his studies and has narrowed the choice to two Lenovo ThinkPads. Which would suit him best?I enter grad school this fall, and plan to upgrade my 2015 MacBook Air. After a lot of research, I’ve narrowed it down to the ThinkPad T480 and the sixth-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon. With modifications and warranties, both fall within my €1,800 (£1,599) budget, with the T480 being marginally cheaper. However, being a student, portability is a major priority. The X1 is certainly lighter at about 1.2kg, but how much of a difference will this make in practical terms?Keyboard quality is another prerequisite, with reviews proving inconclusive. Which device would be a better bet?Lastly, is it worth upgrading the Core i5-8250U to a Core i7-8550U? My usage will mostly be light – word processing, note-taking, browsing – but I intend to keep this laptop at least five years. ABThese two 14in laptops should not be comparable, because they are based on completely different design philosophies. It’s a testament to the progress made in reducing the size and weight of traditional laptops that they are now surprisingly close.There’s still a big market for PCs, so they come in different varieties to meet different needs. The market segments include ultraportables, tablets and convertibles, mainstream laptops, all-in-ones and desktop-replacements, gaming laptops and workstations. Each segment also has different price levels, with “value” ranges for people watching their pennies (eg Dell Inspiron) and high-performance models for upmarket buyers (eg Dell XPS).There’s also a split between consumer and business machines. In general, businesses want their laptops to be functional, durable, expandable and repairable. They also prefer stable configurations. They want to buy thousands of laptops that have the same specifications, not consumer laptops that can change every few months.Both your picks are high-performance laptops built to American Mil-spec standards. The difference is that the T range is designed to be expandable and repairable, like a traditional business laptop, while the X range makes compromises for portability.The ThinkPad T480 is designed to be upgradeable and its two memory slots and can support up to 32GB. This would appeal to programmers and to business users who need lots of memory to handle large spreadsheets, databases and similar tasks.The T480 has a full drive bay that will take a hard drive, though it often ships with an SSD. You can upgrade the HDD or SSD up to a 1TB SSD, if required. It also has a good collection of ports including Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.0, HDMI and SD ports, and an RJ-45 Ethernet port.Like some other ThinkPads, the T480 has a second “bridge” battery, which is removable: you can carry a spare and swap over when you run out of juice. The battery life isn’t exceptional with two 24Whr batteries: Lenovo claims 13.9 hours. However, you can install a monster 72Whr bridge battery and run for a claimed 30.3 hours in all. Of course, this adds weight, as well as a bulge at the bottom.Around the start of this century, I used to carry a ThinkPad with two fat batteries and can testify that, if you want really long battery life, it works a treat. But recharging them is a bit of a chore.The T480 is a good choice if you need lots of memory, or have to work away from mains power. But these features may add to the thickness (19.95mm) and the weight (from 1.58kg to 1.87kg).The X1 Carbon is much more like your MacBook Air in being designed to be as thin and light as possible for its screen size and specification. In fact, at its 1.13kg starting weight, an X1 will be lighter than your 1.34kg Air.If you’re carrying it around, you will definitely notice the difference between an X1 and a T480, even if you are young and fit enough not to mind.To save space and weight, you lose the T480’s drive bay and Ethernet port, and the SD card slot is reduced to a microSD slot. But at least you get two Thunderbolt 3 ports, HDMI and an Ethernet dongle.As a MacBook Air user, you will be familiar with the compromises required for an ultraportable laptop. If you found them really frustrating, that would be a reason to go for the T480. If not, the X1 Carbon offers more power and more expandability than the Air, at a higher cost.Both the T480 and X1 Carbon have the latest Intel processors and should deliver much the same performance. Having bought a desktop with a Core i5-8400, I’m pretty confident that the quad-core i5-8250U will last you five years. You don’t need a Core i7-8550U for word processing, note-taking and browsing. The i7 only costs an extra £91.20 in the UK, which is tempting, but perhaps you could spend the cash on a better screen.I couldn’t say which machine has a better keyboard without trying them side by side. In theory, the T480 should be better, because thicker laptops allow keys with more travel. However, given the X1 Carbon’s hero status as Lenovo’s brand leader, I’d expect it to be above average and not significantly worse.Otherwise, as I keep saying, laptop keyboards are not ergonomic. Whenever possible, put your laptop on a riser – or just a pile of books – and plug in an ergonomic USB keyboard and mouse.If you set the brightness too high then it will also devour your battery, but that’s another story.In the end, both machines are good, but they meet different needs. It seems to me that you will benefit from the X1 Carbon’s best features – lightness, fast charging and screen quality – but you will not really benefit from the T480’s features, such as fat batteries and the ability to handle 32GB of RAM. In the end, of course, it’s your money, your choice.Have you got a question?

But are they missing out and what does it do to television?It feels as if we are in a period of boom and bust in TV. It’s definitely boom time in terms of the amount of new shows being produced – more than 520 in 2018 – but the bust comes from how quickly those shows go from critically lauded to seemingly laboured.In the golden age of TV, big shows have tended to have a slow burn. Breaking Bad flew below the radar and survived cancellations and capricious network execs in order to make it to five staggering seasons. The Wire took a similarly glacial path to critical adoration and cult status, as did Mad Men.But now, as TV produces more shows than ever, something has changed. Viewers’ thirst for new shows has grown and – with the rise of on-demand services and competing streaming sites – they have a larger choice than ever before. It is not just the latest crop of productions that is vying for their attention, but also things they might have previously missed in their TV education. It has never been as tempting to quit a show and move on to the next offering.“In general, dramas are the most resistant to steep declines, maybe because the sheer need to know what happens next keeps audiences placated even if the plotting and writing aren’t quite as adept as they once were.”That last idea, that audiences will stick with a show because of its previous achievements, seems to be wearing thin. Announcing that you are quitting a show is in. Producing an extensive list with your reasons for stopping watching it is even better. Some critics have gone as far as to explain how long you should give certain types of shows (comedies, procedurals, dramedies etc) before jacking them in. When the options seem endless in an era of plenty for the viewer, a show’s potency can easily become diluted with each passing season.There could be another factor at work: whether or not a show is deemed “necessary”. In a piece for the New York Times, Lauren Oyler discussed how the idea of necessary art is changing the way people consume culture.“What has become truly necessary is stating the obvious: no work of art, no matter how incisive, beautiful, uncomfortable or representative, needs to exist. Yet the internet — the same force that has increased awareness of social-justice movements — has hyperbolised all entreaties to our fragmented attention s … the concerned citizen’s natural response is to prioritise.”When we prioritise, we shelve those shows we no longer need.Last year shows that arrived with huge fanfare and critical adoration ended with a whimper. Girls, The Americans, Halt and Catch Fire and even – arguably – Twin Peaks, no longer had the critical support or tenacious audiences that their earlier efforts had garnered. Just like Phillip Jeffries, the steam runs out of shows. Others seem simply too big to die.Orange is the New Black seems destined to remain in a sort of TV purgatory. It has more than enough fans to sustain itself on Netflix and the streaming site is keen to back it considering it’s still one of its most-loved originals. But does it feel as vital as it did when it was first released? Remember when Empire was breaking viewing figures and making history? Now it’s a cautionary tale of hubris and the fickle nature of modern viewers.The Handmaid’s Tale looks destined to go a similar route. When it arrived you couldn’t move for critics and commentators falling over themselves to talk about how “timely” it was, but before we were halfway through season two things had shifted. Now its unremittingly bleak brand of TV has become too much for the same people who cheered it on 12 months ago, and the prospect of another eight seasons seems like Gileadean torture rather than something worth enduring.Speaking to The Ringer, Parks and Recreation showrunner Mike Schur made the case for sticking with shows beyond middling first seasons. “You have to bail on things that don’t work, even if you’ve sunk a ton of time into them,” he said, referring to why shows can take time to find their feet. “The reason that most shows’ best seasons are number two and three is because you’ve had enough time to learn about the characters and the audience has had enough time to get to know them.” Who’s up for Handmaid’s season three?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba18963f27f887168b76a5fe486c0e89e27e89d7/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f44fbc6179b7259b76261ec7bb1d285e","title":"what happens after ice tears your family apart the storm descended","story":"After Ice raids Fresh Mark, a meatpacking plant in Salem, Ohio, and detains 146 workers, chaos and confusion follow for affected families On 19 June, Ice officers descended on Fresh Mark, a meatpacking plant in Salem, Ohio, and detained 146 workers. The scene was chaotic. “Nos cayó la tormenta,” one worker told me: the storm descended on us.One minute, people were slapping labels on packages of bacon. The next, there were uniformed men shouting, “Go!” Many workers thought the building was on fire. They fled outside to handcuffs and the swirling lights of police cars. Three men hid in a storeroom, crouched on stacks of wooden pallets. They waited it out and escaped. All the other Hiic workers were detained, even those with work permits.Workers who could prove authorization were let go, though some were held for days. Pregnant women and women with small children were also released, a mercy bestowed only because of timing: earlier in June, after a large raid on an Ohio gardening center, hundreds of children had been stranded at daycare centers and schools when their parents were detained. The situation had caused public outcry, which Ice was keen to avoid this time around.Many of the released women were given ankle bracelets and court dates others were told to watch for papers in the mail. Meanwhile, the women held in detention disappeared. While the detained men were channeled to Youngstown and Cleveland and Michigan and began to strategize with family members via phone, the women vanished more than a week after the raid, no one had any idea where they were.In response, the labeling line at Fresh Mark sped up. The remaining workers had to compensate for missing bodies. Sandra, a Guatemalan mother of three who’d been detained in the raid and released because she was eight months pregnant, explained to me: “Los Americanos se van.” The Americans leave. The work is too much for them, the line too fast, she said, with the only hint of pride I saw light up her face. There were too few workers left: seven out of 11 in Sandra’s unit had been detained. The four who remained were viejitas, Sandra explained: little old ladies.Fresh Mark produces meat products: the hot dogs sold at baseball stadiums across the midwest, the pepperoni on pizza, the bacon on Wendy’s Baconator. These iconic American products – bought at Walmart and grilled in a backyard on the Fourth of July, sizzled up for Sunday breakfast, chowed in the seventh inning of a Reds game – are carefully prepared by indigenous Guatemalans working long hours without papers.The landing page on the Fresh Mark website is a banner of a little white boy taking a piece of bacon from a paper-towel covered plate, held out by an older white hand. The banner reads: “Feeding families is a great responsibility.” In the lower right corner is a circular stamp declaring: “Made With Pride, USA, Since 1920.” The Made in USA stamp travels with the scroll, standing firm in the right corner.Scrolling down, the company announces over a supersized image of pepperoni pizza: “Like you, we take it very seriously. Some of the world’s most well-known grocery stores, food service companies and restaurants count on Fresh Mark.”Scrolling a little further, the message concludes on a photo of a blonde, white girl eating a sandwich: “So our customers and yours,” the banner reads, “can focus on what really matters.”The Friday after the raid, I traveled to Salem with my friend Mary Jayne, who runs a non-profit that offers interpreting and translation services, to volunteer as an interpreter for released detainees and family members of the detained.Approaching Salem from the south-east, we drove on a narrow seam between plots of corn and soybean. Passing through the small communities of Unity and Columbiana, the American flags came on quick and brash: 15, 20, 50 in rapid succession, until the excess was almost comical. Then, quick as they’d appeared, the flags were gone, and we were back in open land and sky.Soon, we arrived at the Centro San Pablo, a charitable organization run out of the packed, overheated basement of Salem’s Saint Paul’s Catholic church.Centro San Pablo is run by Sister Rene Weeks, a tall, thin white woman with close-cropped gray hair who manages to be everywhere and handling everything at once. She welcomed us before disappearing into the fray. Two lawyers sat at a folding table with laptops and papers. The wait to see them was hours long. Women breastfed infants in slings, and many wore outfits that were Walmart incantations of indigenous Guatemalan dress: ankle-length skirts with floral prints, black flats with fake rhinestones. Several girls had combs in their long black hair, which fell to their waists. The men wore baseball caps, sleeveless tank tops and chanclas, open-toed athletic sandals. Most people were considerably shorter than my own 5ft 3in.The room held that distinctly Latin American energy derived from a whole lot of people waiting interminably for an obscure bureaucratic procedure that may never come to pass. There was an open box of sticky Dunkin’ Donuts. Stale coffee. Packages and packages of diapers. We joined the chaos.For the next three hours, we asked people for their names and immigration histories: were you detained? Was a family member detained? Have you heard from him or her? Did you sign anything? Have you ever been arrested, deported, had any interaction with the law?I snuck in extra questions on the side. I spent years living in Mexico, and my husband is from a tiny village that, 30 years ago, was much like the ones these people had fled. He and I have traveled throughout the remote mountain pueblos of Oaxaca, reporting on immigration, and in these Guatemalan workers’ faces I remembered those mountains – the smoke coming off comales, the señoras hurrying small children wrapped in fleece blankets through vast, empty plazas.“Why did you come?” I asked one woman, whose name I carefully sounded out after she told me with shamed apology that she could not read or write. Her face was marked by the pale splotches that signify malnutrition. Like many of these migrants, her first language was K’iche’, and her Spanish was basic. She squinted to understand me and I leaned closer to understand her. There wasn’t enough food for her and her son in Guatemala, she said. “We were searching for herbs.” When I pressed further, she shook her head, closed her eyes. “No, no, I don’t want to talk about that time.”She had come to the US with her brother, who was now in detention somewhere in the Midwest. She hadn’t heard from him since Tuesday. What could she do? she asked. I had no idea. “Gracias,” she said, and sat back to wait her turn. One intake form after another: detained brother, uncle, husband, wife. Can I go back to work? the room wondered collectively in a dozen variations. Even those with work permits were hesitant one 18-year-old waited hours just to sit with a lawyer and ask him if it was OK to go back.“You have a work permit!” the lawyer told him. “Yes, yes!”Around 5 o’clock, Sister Rene announced that we were done for the day. She asked for a closing prayer from a woman named Flor, who was a full foot shorter than me, with dark hair pulled back in a low ponytail. Flor had been detained in the raid but released. She had five children, including a six-month-old and a one-and-a-half-year-old. She stood in the middle of the room and smiled at us. Then she bowed her head and closed her eyes, thanking the sister and the volunteers, speaking to God with the notes of humility, endurance and misericordia that form the chorus of the migrant experience. When she opened her eyes, she began to cry.“Pray for my children,” she begged us, sobbing. “¿Qué van a hacer mis niños?”The next morning, Mary Jayne and I returned to the Centro San Pablo with another volunteer interpreter from El Salvador named Ximena. At 9am, families were already waiting to apply for assistance. Their breadwinners snatched, these families were suspended over a financial cliff. My day would be spent cataloguing need. “How much food do you have in your fridge right now?” “How much for rent?” “When is it due?” “Tienes biles?”Most people who weren’t part of a large family lived with at least three or four others. Most did not know their landlord’s name, or the name of their electric, light or gas companies. Someone showed up on their doorstep once a month and they handed that person an envelope of cash. On time, no questions. I had brought a bag of toys, and the second I put them on the ground they were descended upon by a small girl and boy. I gauged the boy’s age as about two, the girl perhaps four: she was the same height as my daughter. Their mother sat near them on a chair, shushing a tiny baby in a sling. She looked unbelievably young.I beckoned her to come over: “Pase.” She spoke hardly any Spanish, only K’iche’. She smiled a lot. Her baby was barely three weeks old, and sick. Her little girl, whom I had thought was four, was seven. The boy was two. The husband had a job at a rancho, picking fruit or vegetables, but something had happened I couldn’t make out specifics. Neither of them had been working at Fresh Mark but had noticed a fervor of help at this moment and positioned themselves near it.She did not know her address or her phone number and I couldn’t fill out her form. I offered to help carry diapers and wipes to her house so that her husband could give me this information and the Centro could contact them later.We set out across the hot parking lot. The mother walked quickly and the children kept up. The family crossed the streets diagonally, as if they were not streets at all but fields. Each time, I clutched the older daughter’s hand. The houses had chain link fences cordoning off tiny yards, soggy toys toppled in patches of grass. At the house, her husband was surprised and cordial, with a mouth full of gold teeth. He, too, looked impossibly young, barely into his early twenties. He spoke Spanish and explained that he’d been working at a rancho – a farm or gardening center – picking tomatoes, but the work was sporadic, and lately he hadn’t had enough. He was too scared now to try Fresh Mark. He was looking for more work at ranchos, but two huge raids in the preceding weeks made this dicey. He gave me his address and phone number while I watched the seven-year-old carefully remove the two-year-old’s shoes.The kitchen was small and smelled of cooking oil next to it was a living room of the same size, bare except for scattered objects around its edges, with a linoleum floor. I couldn’t see any other rooms, or furniture. The husband thanked me and I waved goodbye, the mother smiling the same smile – innocent or weary, I couldn’t tell.Flor, who’d led the prayer on my first afternoon in Salem, told me: “We ran away from one thing in Guatemala, and now another thing is happening to us.” Everywhere these migrants went, they worked – the most difficult and least appreciated work – and everywhere they went they were loathed for it.When Flor was detained, and she waited for hours panicking about whether she’d ever see her children again, she thought, I am not a criminal. I’m fighting to eat, to give something to my children. I’m not stealing.When the national conversation tends to revolve only around the “illegality” of immigrants – the role of various agencies in immigration enforcement, what that enforcement should look like and how much it should cost, and most of all, whether or not to give “amnesty” – no one actually has to acknowledge their labor.Amnesty is the most ironic term of all: Republicans rage and Democrats cower at the idea of granting “forgiveness” to the people who have, for decades, been powering the US economy. Here the absurdity of their invisible labor reaches its nadir: when we, driving on roads they have built, offering our toddlers the blueberries they have plucked, eating the meat they have slaughtered and cleaned and processed, ask: “Should we or should we not pardon them for their work?”A week later, my husband and I returned to Salem to talk to families affected by the raid and try to get a bigger picture of its effects. The Centro San Pablo was quiet. The detained were still gone – perhaps for years. The released were lying low, trying to decide whether to return to work or pack up and head elsewhere. Several families had already left for Alabama, where there was work in the chicken plants.In the mid-afternoon, a family wandered in. The father, Francisco, was tall and broad-chested. The mother, Sandra, was short with a big gap-toothed smile. (Sandra and Francisco, as well as their children, are identified by pseudonyms.) Sandra was noticeably pregnant and trailing three little girls. They knew most of the small smattering of people in the room and said their holas and como estás before settling in.Sandra was waiting to see what would happen after her release, whether she’d get papers in the mail. Francisco, who had finished his shift at Fresh Mark just before the raid, was trying to decide if and when to go back to work.They had both grown up near the Guatemalan border with Mexico. When she was a baby, Sandra’s parents and grandparents had fled with her to the southern Mexican state of Chiapas to escape the massacre of indigenous peoples by Guatemalan government forces during a devastating civil war. When Sandra was six, her father died, and her mother remarried and started another family. Sandra’s grandparents moved back to Guatemala, taking her with them. She stopped school before second grade, and began work at age seven, harvesting plums, peanuts, hibiscus. “Trabajas por ti mismo,” she told me: you work for yourself.At 14, Sandra’s grandfather died, and her uncle took her in, but not for free. He was a sharecropper in Chiapas. He would take her and other workers in the back of a truck across the Mexican border to his plots of land, where they would shuck and degrain corn all day. She wasn’t paid. She was simply earning her keep. At 18, she decided to join Francisco, whom she’d met in the village, in San Diego.She walked for four days through the desert. Towards the end, her group ran out of water. They used their hands to scrape the needles from cactus leaves and crack them open. The water inside was so sour it was hardly drinkable, but it kept them alive.In San Diego, she and Francisco rented a room for $550. The room was in an apartment with four other rooms, each filled with three men splitting the rent. She bought a small refrigerator and the landlord charged her $25 extra per month for it. She took care of a little boy, and Francisco worked in landscaping, but the money was barely enough. When an uncle told her about rents in Salem – where, for around the same price, Sandra and Francisco could rent a whole house and their family could live alone – they decided to make the move.Francisco had already been in the US for 14 years. He had also started work in Guatemala at seven. In the morning, he would go to school, and in the afternoon his family would assign him a plot of land to work. He was not allowed to rest or do homework until finished, at which point it was dark. “I used to study by candlelight,” he said.He had been deported twice. The first was not long after he arrived he and four friends had the extraordinary bad luck of taking a wrong turn onto a military base. He had no idea at the time that he could avoid deportation because he was a minor. He told the authorities he was Mexican, so they sent him to Tijuana, where he crossed immediately back into the US.The second time, he and Sandra were in Salem and the three girls had been born. He was driving in the snow and the car lost traction and slid up onto a sidewalk, where it was stranded. The police officer who came to help asked him for his license, and that was that. In detention, he said to the Ice officer: “I have my daughters,” and the officer replied: “You’ll have to call them.”Telling me this, he sighed. He crossed his arms over his chest. I asked him if he wanted to stay in the US.“She wants to stay here for the girls’ education,” he said, gesturing at Sandra.“You’d like to go back to the pueblo?” I asked.“Sí, claro, sí, el pueblo,” he replied, like it was a no-brainer. When I asked him what they would do in Guatemala if they went back, he widened his eyes, pursed his lips and shrugged. It was absurd. It was like asking my daughter what she would do with a million dollars: an unimaginable concept. There was no work. He might, if he were scrappy, be able to run a small subsistence farm that would feed his family. But schools? And where he lived near the Mexican border, he said, narcos were constantly killing each other.We were interrupted by a waitress from Jalisco’s, a nearby Mexican restaurant that had provided free meals for the workers affected by the raid. The waitress, Isabel, was dressed in a teal uniform straight out of a telenovela. She had a pale, heart-shaped face and a sturdy sense of conviction.In Guatemala, Isabel said, the people don’t even have potable water. They live in cardboard houses with tin roofs. There is no money for anything, not even clothes. She pointed to a certificate on the wall, thanking Jalisco’s for contributing funds for a town’s school. The mayor of that town, she told us, had spent money on that certificate for Jalisco’s when the kids at the school didn’t even have notebooks.Francisco nodded. Sandra was on the floor, putting together a butterfly puzzle with Jorge and the girls.“I lived in rough poverty. I know what it is to live through hard times, to get by day to day.” Isabel had come to the US at 25 and started working in a restaurant. There were weeks, she said, when she had nothing to eat weeks she slept as much as possible, so she didn’t feel hungry. Eventually, her sisters had joined her here and they’d opened Jalisco’s. She’d married an American citizen. They had two children.“Here,” she told us, “It’s easy to raise a child who thinks they’re better.” She tried to guard against it, telling her kids, constantly: tú tienes todo. You have everything Sandra and Francisco gave their three girls American names.: Ashley, Tiffany and Kelly.The night Sandra was detained, she called Francisco, crying, saying: “Take care of my children.” He was sick with fear. He did not tell the children that their mother might be sent back to a country they did not know. But they picked up on it anyway. On TV, they saw police cars with flashing lights outside their mom’s workplace. The oldest asked why her mother wasn’t home, what was going on. Now, when they see a police car passing, they run inside and hide.Sandra and Francisco work six days a week: he on the am shift, from 6 to 2.30, she on the pm shift, from 3.30 to midnight. He walked to work at 5am so he wouldn’t have to drive. I asked what they did on the weekends and they looked at me for a moment as if trying to grasp the question. The one day they had off – Sunday – they woke, cleaned the house, went to Walmart to buy groceries, then headed to the lavandería to do laundry.That was it. That was their American life.Americans consume their labor, literally – in protein – and figuratively, in the ongoing enthrall to corporate profit. Yet a significant percentage of Americans want to give absolutely nothing in return. Not a fair minimum wage. Not health care. Not decent education in public schools. Not even the most fundamental right of legality.At a candlelight vigil for separated immigrant families in DC, a Sikh priest repeated: “We are not separate. We are not separate. We are not separate.” Greed grows out of separateness, out of a belief that I am more deserving of the luxury of comfort, of security, of my house full of light and books than the African who has crossed an ocean and a continent to get here, than the Honduran man who picked my cherries.Flor told me that while she was waiting in detention, she couldn’t eat, she couldn’t drink. She had no idea if she would see her children again. She had spent $15,000 to get her family here, to this tiny town in Ohio, where there was a job on the line. All she wanted was to work and be with her children.I want to give them the best,” she told me. “You know?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d7d6c06dfac28ffe6dc927dba7edabb76cfd3cc/0_426_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95a0f2c07bc1636cb184cebcf2cd025c","title":"british airways criticised by lgbt groups over asylum removals","story":"Activists accuse airline that is sponsor of UK’s biggest gay pride event of putting profits before human rightsBritish Airways has been condemned for cooperating with the removal of refused asylum seekers persecuted for their sexuality while sponsoring the UK’s biggest gay pride event.A letter signed by LGBT rights campaigners, performers and businesses as well as several MPs calls on BA, a sponsor of Brighton Pride, to stop accepting contracts from the Home Office for immigration removals. “The presence of companies that profit off deportations is an affront to the vision of freedom Pride represents,” the letter says. “It is an added insult that many of those deported on British Airways are LGBTQIA+ people who should be marching with us at the parade but instead are brutally rounded up and ejected from the UK to face poverty, persecution and in some cases death.”Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the Home Office accepted only a quarter of applications for asylum based on sexual orientation, “despite applications coming from some of the most homophobic regimes in the world”. Abbott, one of the signatories of the letter, said: “Any airline that engages with the Home Office’s current regime is quite clearly putting their profits ahead of basic human rights.” Other signatories include the Labour MPs David Lammy and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, Matt Beard, executive director of the global LGBT activist group All Out, Zita Holbourne, national chair of Barac UK, and Mike Jackson, a co-founder of Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners. BA said it was proud to support Brighton Pride and it had a legal duty under the Immigration Act 1971 to remove iniduals when asked to do so by the Home Office. “Not fulfilling this obligation amounts to breaking the law,” it said.“We are not given any personal information about the inidual being deported, including their sexuality or why they are being deported,” the airline said. “The process we follow is a full risk assessment with the Home Office, which considers the safety of the inidual, our customers and crew on the flight.”Colin Yeo, an immigration barrister, said captains and airlines who refused to carry out immigration removals could face criminal charges, but in practice it was likely that the government and airlines had more pragmatic arrangements.  understands that the Home Office has contracts with airlines to carry out removals.However, she said, there were “certain circumstances” where the law required airlines to carry deportees. “We will always comply with the law and will continue to comply with this legislation,” the spokeswoman said. A spokeswoman for the airline later said it had never been forced to fly any removals under the Immigration Act. The Home Office would not answer questions about the exercise of its powers to force airlines to deport iniduals, nor about its contractual agreements with airlines to fly immigration removals. It said the UK was a world leader in handling asylum claims based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and no one found to have been persecuted would be returned to their country of origin.“However, where someone is found not to need international protection and has no other basis to remain in the UK, we do expect them to leave,” a spokesman said. “We work in collaboration with airlines to ensure any facilitated voluntary or enforced removals are carried out effectively, efficiently and with the welfare of returnees and other passengers at the heart of the process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a101504d3fb4a921747266c37bbe1e13d143194/0_311_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4541f8ee9c32641a2cfba348f023442","title":"google working on censored search engine for china","story":"Human rights groups concerned by reports about software that would leave out blacklisted contentGoogle has been condemned for supporting state censorship following reports that it is working on a mobile search app that would block certain search terms and allow it to reenter the Chinese market.The California-based internet company has engineers designing search software that would leave out content blacklisted by the Chinese government, according to a New York Times report citing two unnamed people familiar with the matter. Such blacklisting would allow the company to reverse its move out of the country eight years ago due to censorship and hacking.The Intercept news website first reported the story, saying the Chinese search app was being tailored for the Google-backed Android operating system for mobile devices. The service was said to have been shown to Chinese officials. Google did not respond to a request for comment. The state-owned China Securities Daily, citing information from “relevant departments”, denied the report.As well as the search app, Google is reportedly building a second app, focused on news aggregation, for the Chinese market, which would also comply with the country’s censorship laws, according to the Information tech news site. The news app would take its lead from popular algorithmically-curated apps such as Bytedance’s Toutiao – released for the western market as TopBuzz – that eschew human editors in favour of personalised, highly viral content.There was no guarantee the project, codenamed Dragonfly, would result in Google search returning to China. Google already offers a number of apps to Chinese users, including Google Translate and Files Go, and the company has offices in Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai. But the largest of its services – search, email and the Play app store – are all unavailable.Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin has previously cited his birth in the Soviet Union in the 1970s as explaining his opposition to enabling Chinese censorship. “It touches me more than other people having been born in a country that was totalitarian and having seen that for the first few years of my life,” he told the  in 2010, as Google pulled its censorship from Chinese search after four years of cooperating with the authorities.The Chinese human rights community said Google’s acquiescence to China’s censorship would be a “dark day for internet freedom”.“It is impossible to see how such a move is compatible with Google’s ‘do the right thing’ motto and we are calling on the company to change course,” said Patrick Poon, China researcher for Amnesty International. “For the world’s biggest search engine to adopt such extreme measures would be a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom. In putting profits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory.”GreatFire, a China-based organisation that monitors internet censorship and provides ways around the “great firewall” for Chinese residents, said the move “could be the final nail in the Chinese internet freedom coffin” and that “the ensuing crackdown on freedom of speech will be felt around the globe”.Speaking to the  in 2016, GreatFire’s co-founder “Charlie Smith” – a pseudonym – had praised Google’s initial decision to pull out of China in 2010 over what it said were cyber-attacks aimed at its source code and the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.“I think people are going to be very wary and attentive to how Google goes back into China. And hopefully they’re going to show us that there is a way to go back in without having to censor,” Smith said at the time.“I would be disappointed, and I know that a lot of other people would be disappointed, if Google went back in and said ‘we’re going to censor our search results again’, because they’ve made that mistake already, and they should understand that the situation hasn’t changed.”Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae646aabf75edb3d2a152b9a0b4754fcfb08848e/0_185_4383_2630/master/4383.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f677e06bad3a2b3500e195a68efbbee0","title":"europeans keep cool in the heatwave in pictures","story":"As the Met Office forecasts record-breaking temperatures of nearly 50C in Portugal and Spain, people do their best to stay cool across Europe"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Teacher seeks to stop the TCI from notifying the Garda\u0026rsquos National Vetting Bureau about an investigation into himAbuse survivors to gather at Garden of Remembrance during Pope\u0026rsquos visitUK government urged to bring forward legislation allowing donations since 2014 to be made publicPost network to be reduced to 950 offices after postmasters take retirement packagesDUP leader accuses former Labour spindoctor of \u0026lsquoliberally adding\u0026rsquo to the Belfast AgreementGsoc report cites serious failings in Garda investigation into 1996 west Cork killingFarmers say animals have been \u0026lsquomercilessly\u0026rsquo raiding feed supplies in the areaWarren Dumbrell who is serving life for fatal stabbing, claimed detention rights were breachedGarda forensic investigator says he did not note any warning signs or marking on approach to severe bendOrders for patients with dementia are among the first of their kind to be sought from the courtsCases believed to have developed following contact with one of two earlier cases at Dublin hospitalsNormand Larose (62) suffered severe brain injury in fall from pony and trap in AprilIrish Water Safety appeals to public to take precautions and reduce risk of getting into difficulty in waterMinister: \u0026lsquoThey\u0026rsquore doing the State a great service\u0026rsquo by allowing parents to go back working\u0026lsquoWe need evidence-based investment and a cash payment to grandparents is not that\u0026rsquoBottle found on Alaskan shore is traced to a cousin of Oscar-winning actor Brenda FrickerEstimated half a million Roma were exterminated by Nazis during second World WarCourt hears man in his 60s with epilepsy and brain disease is a Spurs fan and wants to be able to walk to his mother\u0026rsquos grave"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584835.1533239998!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"an post to close 161 post offices","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe IPU and An Post had been involved in protracted industrial talks over restructuring plans for the postal network.  Photograph: Bryan O’BrienAn Post has announced it will close 161 post offices as part of a voluntary retirement scheme agreed with postmasters. The deal follows lengthy negotiations between the State postal service and the Irish Postmasters’ Union (IPU). The closures will reduce the post office network from 1,111 offices to 950, and An Post will release details of which offices will be closing at the end of the month. The IPU and An Post had been involved in protracted industrial talks over restructuring plans for the postal network. In May, the IPU passed a ballot to support a new plan for the post office network, with the support of 80 per cent of members. The voluntary retirement package was included as part of that overall future plan for the postal service with 161 postmasters applying for it. The plan had been agreed with the union’s executive and An Post, and was approved by the membership on May 11th. Debbie Byrne, managing director of An Post retail said the closures marked a “key point on the journey towards a stronger post office network.”“Some closures were inevitable in a network that has been largely unchanged for many years. The consolidation of post office business will strengthen the remaining post offices,” she said. The restructuring would include the rollout of a wider range of services post offices could provide, which would “see a reinvigorated network across 950 post offices,” she said.“We appreciate that these decisions have not been easy for the inidual postmasters and we are grateful for their dedication over many years of service in their communities,” she said. In a statement, An Post said the company was in agreement with the IPU and postmasters that consolidating the network and “the subsequent transfer of business to neighbouring offices, is essential to the sustainability of the overall network.”The semi-State company said it would stand by commitments that communities with populations of over 500 people would have a post office, and 95 per cent of the population would always be within 15km of at least one post office. There were no plans to close any post offices based on island communities, An Post said. “To meet the above coverage commitments, An Post will also publish at the end of August a target list of new post office locations,” a spokeswoman said. The restructuring is part of a wider €50 million investment programme for the postal network. In areas where post offices will be closing, local shops will provide some services such as stamps, bill payments, mobile-top ups and television licence renewal through a PostPoint counter facility, the company said.

Photo: Nick Bradshaw for The More than half a century after a wildlife biologist in Alaska discovered a message in a bottle buried in the sand, the mystery of the man who threw it into the Pacific Ocean has been solved.In the winter of 1964, Michael Perensovich, who was based in the city of Juneau in Alaska, discovered a small glass bottle on the shores of the Yakutat region of Alaska while on a field trip counting moose in the area.Inside the bottle was a piece of brown paper with a name and address clearly printed in black marker.“Finder please write John J. Fricker, 215 Sarsfield Road, Inchicore, Dublin 8,” says the message. “Dropped into the Mid-Pacific Ocean April 7th 1963. From MV Irish Rowan.”A year after discovering the bottle, Mr Perensovich, who will turn 92 later this year, wrote a letter to the address in Dublin but never heard back. “He wrote to the address a couple of times but never heard anything,” his granddaughter told The . “He’s always told people about it and if ever you go over to the house he says ‘hey, did I show you my message in the bottle?’”More than 50 years after the discovery, Mr Perensovich’s granddaughter, Kari, arrived in Ireland this week hoping to track down the Fricker family.“It’s in a glass case and he hadn’t talked about it in a long time. When I said I was going to try and follow it up he got really excited.”The  had a look too, and following a visit to the address on Sarsfield Road, discovered John “Jackie” Fricker had died in 2013.One of 10 children, Fricker trained as a chef in Paris before backpacking with friends across Europe. He then began working as a chef on board Irish Shipping cargo ships which brought him to the Pacific Ocean. A copy of the Irish Ships Signal newsletter from December 1963 confirms there was a cook on board the Irish Rowan cargo ship.“He was a world class chef and when he wanted to change ships the crew would double his wages to get him to stay,” recalls Gerry Fricker, Jackie’s younger brother who still lives close to the family home.“He was a really nice guy but he had a fiery temper. To meet him he was very gentle speaking. He travelled all over Europe working in hotels, he had a great life.”Jackie never married or had children but “he had a little shop over on the north side of town, a little grocery shop where he made his own bread,” said his brother. “He also did house painting and he loved a bit of gardening himself.”Gerry Fricker, who briefly worked on an oil tanker in the Irish sea, said it was quite common for seamen to drop bottles with messages into the sea. However, most people quickly forgot about the messages and moved on, he said.“It’s really intriguing after all this time that this has happened. It’s like magic. We finally have a conclusion so to speak.”A first cousin of the Fricker brothers is Oscar-winning actor Brenda Fricker. A common ancestor is John Frickers , who was born in about 1874, according to census records. By 1901, he was working as a newspaper reader in The  and living with his parents, retired clerk William Henry and his wife, Sarah.Among his children were Maurice, father of Jackie and Gerry and Desmond, a public relations officer for the department of agriculture whose children included Brenda Fricker who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1990 for her performance in My Left Foot.Kari, who has yet to meet the Fricker family, said she was shocked to discover Jackie’s siblings still lived in Dublin and were willing to meet her.“I was honestly just expecting to take a selfie in front of the address so I’d have a picture to show my grandpa. This is above and beyond anything I believed could happen. It’s an unexpected but very pleasant surprise.“This won’t just make my grandpa’s day, it will make his life.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584187.1533211204!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the 50 year mystery of the irish message in a bottle found on an alaskan shore","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Perensovich was on a break from counting moose when he found this message in a on a beach in Yakutat, Alaska in 1964. Photograph: Kari PerensovichThe granddaughter of a man who discovered a message in a bottle from a Dubliner on the shores of Alaska more than half a century ago has come to Ireland to track down the family of the Inchicore man who wrote the note.It was the winter of 1964 and Michael Perensovich, a wildlife biologist based in the city of Juneau in Alaska, had been sent out on a field exhibition to record the number of moose in the Yakutat region north of the city.Perensovich and his wife had moved from California to Alaska in the late 1950s where the couple bought land near the city of Juneau and built a log cabin. He was often sent on field trips by the forestry department to remote parts of the Alaska and in 1964 he travelled to the Yakutat borough which is known for its long stretches of sandy beach.“That’s where he was the day he found the bottle,” says Kari Perensovich, Michael Perensovich’s granddaughter. “You get a lot of debris washing in on the sand from all over.”Perensovich, on a break from counting moose, was combing the Yakutat beach for Japanese glass fish floats – another item which often washed up on the Alaskan shores – when he noticed a small glass bottle buried in the sand. Inside the bottle was a piece of brown paper with a name and address clearly printed in black marker.“Finder please write John J. Fricker, 215 Sarsfield Road, Inchicore, Dublin 8,” says the message. “Dropped into the Mid-Pacific Ocean April 7th 1963.

Perensovich has visited Ireland a number of times but only recently remembered the glass bottle that sits in her grandfather’s home. “It’s in a glass case and he hadn’t talked about it in a long time. When I said I was going to try and follow it up he got really excited.”Perensovich, who is originally from a small mining village in western Pennsylvania and flew as a pilot in the second world war, will turn 92 later this month. “My grandma passed away a few years ago but he still has his daily routine and does all his errands. He does all the yard work, he’s very active for his age.”Kari says she is the first member of her family to try and find out who dropped the bottle in the Pacific Ocean. “Everyone’s heard the story a million times so I was like, why hasn’t anybody tried this? I’m the first one to follow it up. It sits on the mantle in his house and he sees it every day. It would mean the world to him if we could find the family.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584833.1533239918!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"arlene foster urges brexit negotiators to show more mettle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party was ‘committed to securing a Brexit deal that provides a seamless, frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland’. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireDUP leader Arlene Foster has urged the UK’s Brexit negotiators to show “more mettle” and face down those who prophesise disaster for Northern Ireland under its planned exit from European Union.The UK negotiators “should be decisive and responsible, remaining true both to the union and the referendum result,” she said, in an article for the Impartial Reporter on Thursday.She was responding to an opinion piece in the same newspaper last week by Alastair Campbell, former political advisor to Labour ex-prime minister Tony Blair. Mr Campbell accused Ms Foster of giving no answers “beyond platitudes” to the question of how to manage the Border under Brexit, and argued that while she and other Leavers won the referendum vote in 2016 “they have been losing the argument ever since”.Ms Foster responded: “After the article appeared in print, a fair number of Fermanagh people contacted me. Most of them summed up Mr Campbell with sentences which included the words ‘Iraq’ and ‘spin’.”She said:“For all of his claims to defend the Belfast Agreement, Alastair falls into the same trap as many other commentators by on the one hand liberally adding to the Belfast Agreement and with the other undermining the East-West elements of that Agreement.“He appears to have no objection to erecting a Border down the Irish Sea. This would be economically disastrous for Northern Ireland.“I want to ensure that our local businesses are faced with no barriers to the daily trade which occurs with the Republic of Ireland and I don’t want to see that at the expense of trading with our single biggest market. “Whilst trade with the Republic is important, we sell four times as much goods and services to Great Britain than to the Irish Republic, valued at £14bn. Northern Ireland also purchases nearly six times as much from GB than from the Republic, worth over £13billion.“Perhaps cutting Northern Ireland off from a market which is more important than the Republic of Ireland, rest of the EU and rest of the world combined is just one of the issues that Alastair Campbell is prepared to ‘work it out somehow’ in his desire to thwart Brexit in part if he cannot achieve it in totality.”She said: “The DUP is committed to securing a Brexit deal that provides a seamless, frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland, delivering clarity for businesses and households across Northern Ireland, whilst ensuring the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK is maintained.“In the coming months, UK negotiators should show considerably more mettle than those who adopt a defeatist position. “They should be decisive and responsible, remaining true both to the union and the referendum result. “Then Alastair Campbell and others can be proven wrong and the best outcome for all our people will be achieved.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584871.1533242084!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"electoral commission drops dup brexit funding inquiry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe UK Electoral Commission looked into claims that the DUP, led by Arlene Foster, failed to declare joint spending with other EU referendum campaigners. Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersAn inquiry into allegations surrounding the DUP’s receipt of political donations in the run-up to the UK Brexit referendum is unable to proceed, the UK Electoral Commission has said.The commission looked into allegations made by the BBC Northern Ireland programme Spotlight — Brexit, Dark Money And The DUP, which aired on June 26th last. It made allegations about whether the DUP, currently propping up the minority Conservative government, failed to declare joint spending with other EU referendum campaigners.After requesting further evidence from BBC Northern Ireland, and being told that there was no “significant information” other than what was in the programme, the commission considered whether other evidence sources were available.The commission concluded it “does not have grounds to open an investigation”.In doing so, it noted it “continues to be prohibited by legislation from disclosing any information concerning donations to Northern Ireland recipients made prior to 1 July 2017... We continue to urge the UK government to bring forward legislation that will enable us to publish information on donations from January 2014”.The commission records donations to Northern Irish parties but for many years these were not made public because of security concerns dating back to the Troubles. The ban was due to last only until October 2010, but that date was repeatedly extended and the prohibition was only lifted last March - covering the period from July 1st onwards in a move that was criticised by transparency campaigners.Separately, the electoral commission rejected claims from a former Conservative minister that Remain campaigners breached spending rules .Former international development secretary Priti Patel complained that three videos from lead Remain campaign group Britain Stronger in Europe (BSIE) should have been declared as “joint spending”.Ms Patel, who resigned in disgrace after secret meetings with the Israeli government, also made allegations about late registration of campaigners associated with BSIE.The commission concluded there was no evidence there was joint working on the videos or grounds to suspect a breach of joint spending rules.It said the company under investigation, DDB, also known as Adam and Eve, was a registered campaigner and reported spending correctly.“In this matter, there is not sufficient grounds to suspect that BSIE breached the joint spending rules,” they said.“It was alleged that five campaigners were set up by BSIE and acted under a common plan. The commission has not been provided with or found evidence for an investigation to be opened.”A new investigation has been opened into another registered campaigner, Wake Up and Vote, over claims from Ms Patel that they incurred undeclared joint spending with DDB.A previous commission investigation concluded extracts from two books published since the referendum, describing daily telephone meetings of certain Remain campaigners chaired by BSIE, did not meet the threshold for an investigation.It said: “Evidence indicates the meetings were advisory and did not involve or result in decisions on referendum spending.” (Additional reporting PA)"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.English sparkling wine will be better than Champagne as climate warms, says Michael Gove Labour anti-Semitism row: The historic catalogue of allegations against Jeremy CorbynMajorca beach closed as 10ft shark terrifies touristsDoctors could qualify more quickly after Brexit to solve staff shortages, minister says Government should tell parents not to give smartphones to under-11s, says leading psychiatrist Maths textbooks should be banned because they intimidate pupils, headteacher saysBanks hit homeowners with instant interest rate hike - but fail to pass on improved deal to saversQAnon: the secret Trump conspiracy theoryEmotional Sarah Sanders reveals impact of press scrutiny on her private lifeWhite House declares \u0026#39vast government-wide effort\u0026#39 underway to stop US election meddlingDale Winton died of natural causes, coroner finds Murder in Camberwell: the South London neighbourhood where affluence and deprivation sit side by sideWorker at US child immigration facility arrested for molestationVolunteers could be asked to drive ambulances in bid to avert crisisSubmarine sunk by British warship during First World War found after more than 100 yearsWhere is Angela Merkel?

Their risk of developing dementia increased incrementally the more alcohol they were consuming.Rewatching old football matches can help dementia and mental healthExercise could make dementia progression worse not better, warns study“We show that both long term alcohol abstinence and excessive alcohol consumption may increase the risk of dementia,” the authors of the study, published in the British Medical Journal, wrote.\u0026nbsp“Given the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple by 2050 and the absence of a cure, prevention is key.”Among abstainers, the study also found increased risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These are both conditions which could contribute to dementia, a collective term for the loss of memory, thinking and other cognitive functions, and the leading cause of death in the UK.Moderate alcohol consumption has previously been shown to help protect against these conditions, by reducing cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and it may be this which is responsible for the dementia protecting benefit.However the authors said it would be nearly impossible to find a definitive cause without a much larger and impractical trial where participants are randomly allocated to quit drinking or drinking more heavily.The top 10 countries that drink the most alcohol It could also be that people with higher levels of these types of metabolic diseases were more likely to quit drinking, or healthier and more well off people were more likely to be moderate drinkers. The authors said they would not encourage anyone currently abstaining to change their habits.Of the 9,087 participants, who took part in a British study between 1985 and 1993 and were followed for 23 years on average, there were 397 cases of dementia recorded.The study found long-term abstainers were at the most extra risk of dementia (67 per cent), compared to those who were abstinent in midlife (45 per cent) and those cutting down (50 per cent).“The most intriguing finding from this study was the significantly increased risk of dementia among abstainers… and that association was only present in those who abstained from wine,” said Dr Sevil Yasar from John Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, who was not involved in the study.“Wine, in addition to alcohol, contains polyphenolic compounds, which have been associated with neuroprotective effects on both neurodegenerative and vascular pathways, and with cardioprotective effects through inflammation reduction, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and alteration of lipid profile.”However she added that we should remain cautious about the findings.Dr Sara Imarisio, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, agreed, adding: “People who completely abstain from alcohol may have a history of heavy drinking and this can make it difficult to interpret the links between drinking and health.“Future research will need to examine drinking habits across a whole lifetime, and this will help to shed more light on the relationship between alcohol and dementia.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/13/17/bank-of-england.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/13/17/bank-of-england.jpg","title":"interest rates rise latest updates bank england mortgages mark carney","story":"Created with Sketch.Threadneedle\u0026nbspStreet said further increases will come gradually and to a \u0027limited extent\u0027Click to followThe Independent OnlineThe Bank of England has raised interest rates above 0.5 per cent for the first time since March 2009, taking the base rate to 0.75 per cent. The first hike in more than nine years comes after much anticipation from markets, which were pricing in a 90 per cent chance of a rate increase ahead of the announcement, but few specific signals from the Bank. The monetary policy committee voted unanimously, 9-0, to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points, and said future increases are “likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent”.The MPC added that it “continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal”.The pound had been trading down 0.4 per cent against the dollar ahead of the announcement, but sharply began to reverse those losses just after midday. Threadneedle Street upgraded its growth predictions for the UK economy to an estimate of 1.8 per cent in 2019, up from the 1.7 per cent predicted in May. The Bank also reported that inflation rose to 2.4 per cent in June, above the 2 per cent target due to “ external cost pressures resulting from the effects of sterling’s past depreciation and higher energy prices”.Business groups hit out at the decision to hike rates, saying the move risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty.What would an interest rate rise mean for household finances?Ten things you should know about interest ratesBank of England deputy governor warns against rate riseWhen the BoE’s rate-setting committee last met, three of nine members voted for a rise to 0.75 per cent.

Interest rates fell from 5 per cent to 0.5 per cent in the period between October 2008 and March 2009 when Britain was in the grips of recession. The base rate remained there until August 2016 when, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, the Bank cut it again, to 0.25 percent.

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/12/12/mark-billingham-1.jpg","title":"long reads hero sas who dares wins culture tv marvel","story":"Created with Sketch.Is he a Marvel-esque superhuman or an SAS daredevil? Or is he Ed Sheeran? Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

Good job the food truck was on its way.Paola\u0026nbspBouley, the park’s associate director of carnivore conservation, and two of her colleagues rode up to the fence in a pickup, opened the gate, edged the vehicle just inside the\u0026nbspboma\u0026nbspand began lowering the carcass of a male impala.As she stood in the back of the truck,\u0026nbspBouley\u0026nbspgripped a rope tied to the antelope’s rear legs, with the intention of luring the dogs from the comfort of their enclosure by slowly dragging their breakfast outside. Nice idea, but the dogs could not wait.They snatched at the carcass, tried\u0026nbspdisembowelling\u0026nbspit in mid-air, yanking at the rope so violently they practically pulled the extremely fit\u0026nbspBouley\u0026nbspto the ground.After a brief moment of panic, a new plan was hatched. Tie the rope to the truck instead.Again, lure and vehicle inched out through the gate, and this time the dogs followed, their coats the\u0026nbspcolour\u0026nbspof army camouflage, their ears the size of soap dishes. The dogs bounded to freedom and fell on the impala en masse, just as the scientists hoped they would do.Except something was wrong. The dogs stopped eating. They ran around in confusion.One dog was missing, and not just any cur: It was the top dog, the alpha female of the pack. Where was their queen?Gorongosa\u0026nbspsince their reintroduction\u0026nbsp(Alamy Stock Photo)“It’s\u0026nbspBeira\u0026nbsp– she’s still inside,”\u0026nbspBouley\u0026nbspcalled out, referring to the name chosen for the alpha female by local schoolchildren in\u0026nbsphonour\u0026nbspof the capital city of their province.Loping over to the assembled observers,\u0026nbspBouley\u0026nbspsaid: “She’s not coming out. She’s cautious. She’s always been cautious.”Now more so than ever as\u0026nbspBeira\u0026nbspwas pregnant with pups that the entire pack would help raise. There was too much commotion. “I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to leave,”\u0026nbspBouley\u0026nbspsaid.It’s tough trying to resuscitate one of Africa’s most storied and biologically erse national parks from a state of near-annihilation, the result of a brutal 16-year civil war in which an estimated 1 million Mozambicans were killed and a huge swath of\u0026nbspGorongosa’s wildlife destroyed. Tough, but by no means impossible.Thirty minutes after dispersing her guests,\u0026nbspBouley\u0026nbspsent a joyful update: all pack members had left the pen, and the gate had been closed to prevent their re-entry. The dogs had polished off their last free brunch and were exploring the\u0026nbspneighbourhood, clearly eager to resume their career as team hunters par excellence.“This is a very special time for me,” said Pedro\u0026nbspMuagura,\u0026nbspGorongosa’s park warden. In Mozambique, he said, many families have a totem animal, and his family’s is the wild dog.Yet until the gang of 14 had been relocated from several sites in eastern South Africa as part of\u0026nbspGorongosa’s restoration plan, the only time\u0026nbspMuagura\u0026nbsphad encountered a wild dog was as roadkill.“To see live dogs in my own country, to have them released into\u0026nbspGorongosa, that is a beautiful thing.” he said, almost tearfully.Over the next several days, the ebullient carnivores managed to dispatch another impala and two waterbucks – beefy, handsome antelopes with bright bull’s eye markings on their rears.They are all too common in\u0026nbspGorongosa.Beira’s pregnant belly bulged ever more visibly, and the pack were digging her a den. Lions were no longer the only resident meat-eaters able to keep the spreading herds of grazing mammals in check.AFPGetty Images)Another apex predator, absent for decades from the park’s 1,500 square miles, was back – yet more evidence that Gorongosa is on track for a great second act.Named after a mountain on the rim of the park that in turn was named after the Mwani term for “place of danger,” Gorongosa is far from the largest national park or game reserve in Africa.Kruger National Park in South Africa is five times its size. Gorongosa is not even the biggest park in Mozambique.Yet Gorongosa stands out from the continent’s many photogenic safari destinations as a kind of living laboratory, an ongoing experiment in how nature recovers from the equivalent of a massive haemorrhaging event, and which parts mend best when left to themselves and which require infusions of new blood.Gorongosa has attracted the attention of scientists from around the world who see an opportunity to address, in real time, fundamental questions of ecology, evolution, the rise and fall and shifting distribution of species, and changes in what researchers call the landscape of fear.The bushbuck of Gorongosa, for example, are unusually brazen about venturing away from the concealing foliage that surrounds termite mounds, where the shy, slender antelope traditionally are found.Instead, Gorongosa’s bushbuck are grazing in open grassland, with all the cockiness of African buffaloes or zebras.\u0026nbspIs that good, neutral or destructive to the local habitat – to the mix of vegetation and its microfaunal throngs, the flow of water, the cycling of nutrients, the ease with which dung beetles can put the far-flung bounty to use? And how long before the insouciant bushbuck realise that Gorongosa’s predators are multiplying and heading their way?Gorongosa is at once more and less “natural” than other game reserves in Africa. “There are no fences around Gorongosa, and that’s the way a park is supposed to be,” said Test Malunga, a field guide at the park.Gorongosa\u0026nbspis in for a second great act as the environment returns to normal (Alamy Stock Photo)At the same time, park management, with the blessing of the Mozambique government, has decided to “actively encourage and promote science,” said Robert Pringle, an ecologist at Princeton University who is on the\u0026nbspGorongosa\u0026nbspProject’s board of directors.As a result, researchers are not confined to simple observational studies of the park’s free-ranging wildlife.They can manipulate field conditions to narrow down the spurs to animal movement and foraging choices. They can dart animals to take blood samples, measure their vital signs and then outfit them with\u0026nbspGPS\u0026nbspcollars – and for the elephants, that means necklaces big enough to girdle an oak tree.“Many parks limit or even prohibit such activities,” Pringle said. “But without them you can’t have a truly science-based management strategy or definitively answer burning questions at the forefront of ecological knowledge.”Gorongosa\u0026nbspalso is preternaturally lucky to have a wealthy benefactor dedicated to the park’s restoration and future.Since 2004, Gregory Carr, who made a fortune in telecommunications before turning to full-time philanthropy and human rights advocacy, has spent tens of millions of dollars on the park and the 1,300 square miles of buffer zone that surrounds it, where some of the poorest communities in Mozambique, and hence in the world, can be found.Carr, 59, is genial, driven and unerringly gregarious, a kind of L\u0026nbsppictus\u0026nbspin a baseball cap, always looking for new connections, new ideas for helping the park and its people, new ways to win over\u0026nbspsceptics\u0026nbspand bridge political ides.Despite recurring guerrilla skirmishes in the region, Carr said, “I think the park has done a pretty good job of being everyone’s friend.”His foundation and various donors-in-arms have invested in local schools, mobile clinics, bee farms, sustainable coffee plantations, girls’ clubs, and a master’s program in conservation biology for Mozambican students. The classroom is\u0026nbspGorongosa.“It’s the only conservation biology program in the country,” Carr said. “We’re told it may be the only one in the world taught entirely in a national park.”Carr is a white American with a lot of money, and though\u0026nbspGorongosa\u0026nbspis a national park that belongs entirely to Mozambique,\u0026nbspLarissa\u0026nbspSousa, who works in the department of human development at the park, said that many people in the region believe Carr is the owner of\u0026nbspGorongosa, and they have never been inside.AFPGetty Images)In fact,\u0026nbspGorongosa\u0026nbsppark was founded by colonial Portugal in 1960 largely for the pleasure of affluent western adventurists, but it was quickly claimed as a national treasure when Mozambique won independence in 1975.Behind the park’s\u0026nbspsplendour, explained Piotr\u0026nbspNaskrecki, an associate director of research at\u0026nbspGorongosa, is its location at the southernmost tip of Africa’s Great Rift Valley, a massive geological formation that, over millions of years, has\u0026nbspchannelled\u0026nbsphuge amounts of bioersity into Mozambique’s midriff.To the east of the rift is soft limestone, kneaded and puckered by water into caves and gorges and giving rise to riverine forests, replete with endemic bats, crickets,\u0026nbspmolluscs\u0026nbspand millipedes that thrive on the limestone’s calcium bounty.On the western rim is hard granite and granitic soils that nurture an entirely different assemblage of life-forms, like a newly discovered species of lizard that wedges itself deep into rock cracks, beyond a predator’s reach.In the middle are the floodplains, cycling seasonally between deluge and drainage, and turning tuxedo-black with concentrated nutrients on which vegetation can bloom and herds of herbivores can fatten.Spanning elevations from sea level to 6,000 feet at the top of Mount\u0026nbspGorongosa, the park is a great\u0026nbspmixtape\u0026nbspof “nearly every conceivable habitat,”\u0026nbspaccording Naskrecki. Alpine forest, montane meadow, woodland savannah, grassland, scrub forest, a touch of true rain forest.And as you drive through it, bumping over roads so deeply rutted you feel like a human castanet, you\u0026nbsprealise\u0026nbspyou’ve never been so happy in your life.In the\u0026nbsp1980s, the music stopped. A civil war broke out, the park was shuttered, and government and rebel forces turned\u0026nbspGorongosa\u0026nbspinto a battlefield and makeshift abattoir.Elephants were slaughtered for their tusks. Elands, sables, wildebeests, zebras and other large herbivores were hunted for meat or sport. Lions, leopards and hyenas were killed for being in the way, and many animals simply died of starvation.By the time the fighting and rampant hunting ended in the\u0026nbspmid-1990s, the park’s thundering census of large mammals had been slashed by 95 percent, to numerical whimpers: 15 African buffaloes here, six lions there, five zebras, a few dozen hippos and elephants.Park infrastructure had been destroyed. Only\u0026nbspGorongosa’s bird life, some 500 species strong, survived relatively intact.The park’s wildlife began recovering, but slowly, and on visiting the park in 2003, Carr said, “I could drive around all day and not see a single animal.”After consulting with a broad range of experts, Carr proposed to the Mozambican government a public-private partnership that he hoped would both hasten the recovery of\u0026nbspGorongosa’s grandeur and lift the economy, too.“Being an economic engine and a promoter of human rights, that’s a new way to think about national parks,” Carr said. “The people who live around here, this is their homeland, and they have a right to live in a decent environment that can sustain them.”The team started by restocking the larger herbivores, importing 200 buffaloes and 200 wildebeests from South Africa.As the bulk grazers began trimming back the overgrown grassland, the park’s array of smaller antelope species, with their twisty, calligraphic horns and their\u0026nbspModigliani\u0026nbspfaces, could get through to feed and more reliably breed.The expanding prey options soon lofted the lion count, which in turn began luring back tourists for whom a lion sighting is synonymous with a safari vacation.But the lions alone could not handle the swelling ranks of herbivores and omnivores, and\u0026nbspGorongosa’s scientists\u0026nbsprealised\u0026nbspthe park needed a more erse guild of predators.Where were the leopards? Leopards are the most widespread great cats in the world, yet for mysterious reasons they\u0026nbsphadn’t found their way back to\u0026nbspGorongosa.As a result,\u0026nbspGorongosa’s baboons, a\u0026nbspfavourite\u0026nbspleopard menu item, are breeding like\u0026nbspgrey\u0026nbspsquirrels, devouring everything they can get their\u0026nbspunfastidious\u0026nbspfingers on and moving fearlessly through the landscape.South Africa doubles exports of lion bones for traditional medicineFrom Cairo to Cape Town: 125 years of Africa in photosStone tools reveal primitive humans left Africa earlier than thought“You don’t elsewhere in Africa see baboons walking on the ground at night or sleeping on the ground,” Pringle said. “But here you do.”The researchers’ efforts to import leopards from elsewhere in Africa have proved legislatively challenging, and so they were thrilled when an adult male leopard, a voluntary immigrant from the buffer zone, showed up in late March and as of midsummer appeared to still be around.The scientists admitted they have made mistakes. “We tried to introduce the cheetah,”\u0026nbspNaskrecki\u0026nbspsaid. “But we learned this is not the right environment for them, and historically they have not been here.”African wild dogs, by contrast, have a history in\u0026nbspGorongosa\u0026nbspand are under fewer trade restrictions, and\u0026nbspBouley\u0026nbspsaid another pack would be introduced in 2019.Other puzzling aspects of\u0026nbspGorongosa’s recrudescence remain. On most African reserves, for example, waterbucks are uncommon, bit players compared to other antelope species. In\u0026nbspGorongosa, their numbers have exploded to 50,000.A possible explanation: As one of the few species able to persist on the floodplain year-round, through low water and high, waterbucks may have stayed out of target range during the war and been well positioned to rebound when the shooting stopped.The waterbuck’s triumph, however, may incidentally be slowing the recovery of another water-loving mammal: the hippopotamus.Zebras also have had a surprisingly hard time regaining their footing.Elephants have nearly rebounded to their\u0026nbsppre-war\u0026nbspnumbers, the population notably enriched in iniduals that naturally lack tusks and thus were spared the selective wrath of ivory poachers.“Gorongosa\u0026nbspis not a Ming vase that we’re trying to restore,” Pringle said. “It’s a dynamic ecosystem in recovery” — working like a dog and getting better all the time.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can

climate change mexico university cambridge","story":"Created with Sketch.New research confirms theory about how great society collapsed 1,000 years agoClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe Classic Maya civilisation collapsed 1,000 years ago leaving behind remnants such as the Edzna ruins at CampecheAn enormous drought that swept across Mexico around 1,000 years ago triggered the demise of one of the world’s greatest ancient civilisations.Scientists studying the climate at the time of the ancient Maya found that rainfall fell by up to 70 per cent at the time the region\u0027s city states were abandoned.The downfall of this great society has been the source of much debate, and the idea that drought brought about its\u0026nbspdownfall has been mooted for years.Now, a team of international researchers has managed to calculate the conditions on the Yucatan Peninsula at the time of the decline using sediment samples from a local lake.The role of climate change in the collapse of Classic Maya civilisation is somewhat controversial, partly because previous records are limited to qualitative reconstructions, for example whether conditions were wetter or drier, said Nick Evans, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge.Our study represents a substantial advance as it provides statistically robust estimates of rainfall and humidity levels during the Maya downfall.Ancient necropolis discovered in EgyptAn archaeologist works on a damaged coffinAn archaeologist works on a sarcophagus at the necropolisSkulls found at the burial siteAnother sarcophagus

decorated with the heads of the four sons of the god HorusExamining a sarcophagus on siteClassic Maya civilisation refers to a period from 250 to 800 AD, when the enormous stone monuments for which the region is known were constructed.However, towards the end of this period a mysterious event led to their limestone cities being abandoned.The Maya people survived to the present day across the region, but by the time the first Europeans encountered them their power was considerably depleted.Suggested triggers for this collapse have included war, invasion and the loss of trade routes.In the new research, published in the journal Science, Mr Evans and his team built on work from the 1990s that suggested extreme drought was linked with the economic and political changes of the time.They analysed water trapped within crystals of a mineral called gypsum, found in Lake Chichancanab, to work out precise values for changes in rainfall and humidity hundreds of years ago.During droughts, more water would have evaporated from the lake, and because the lighter isotopes – or chemical variants – of water evaporate faster, a higher proportion of heavier ones indicates drought.This method is highly accurate and is almost like measuring the water itself, explained Mr Evans.The scientists can now use this data to predict the impact of droughts on agriculture in the region, and work out how a changing climate led to the end of the Classic Maya.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in

Sketch.Experts have discovered act of cremation actually crystallises a bone’s structure and allows its origins to be detected – something previously thought to be impossibleClick to followThe Independent OnlineStonehenge: Origins of those who built world-famous monument revealed by groundbreaking scientific researchA new\u0026nbspscientific\u0026nbspresearch collaboration\u0026nbspis, for the first time, revealing who built Stonehenge. The cutting-edge study sheds a remarkable light on the geographical origins of the Neolithic community that first constructed the ancient site.Complex tests carried out on 25 Neolithic people who were buried at or following the time of the initial construction of the now world-famous monument, have revealed that 10 of them lived nowhere near Stonehenge, but in western Britain, and that half of those 10 potentially came from southwest Wales (where the earliest Stonehenge monoliths came from).The other 15 could be local to Stonehenge, Wiltshire-origin iniduals, or the children of\u0026nbspother descendants of migrants from the west. All the remains were cremations.UCL)Up until now, it has always been assumed that it was not possible to carry out place-of-origin tests on burned bones – but recent research at Oxford University by\u0026nbspBelgian scientist, Dr Christophe Snoeck of the Free University of Brussels, has now discovered that the act of cremation actually crystallises a bone’s structure and prevents the crucial origin-indicating isotope evidence from being contaminated by isotopic signals in the surrounding soil.The cremated remains from Stonehenge of the 10 iniduals of probable western British origin, were buried at various stages between the 33rd\u0026nbspcentury BC and the 28th century BC.Half of them (mainly from the 33rd-30th century BC) were probably from west Wales, while others (mainly from the 30th-28th century BC) were probably associated with places between west Wales and Gloucestershire. It’s likely that they were a\u0026nbsproughly even mix of males and females and that they were of high social status. In all the cases, it is not known whether the iniduals died shortly before all or parts of their cremated remains were transported to Stonehenge – or whether they were revered ancestors who had died several generations earlier.Although the geographically intermediate examples hint at there being a well-worn prehistoric land route between west Wales and Stonehenge, nobody yet knows exactly how the stones (and the cremated remains) were transported. Sea and land routes are both possible.The most likely sequence of events suggested by this and other research s literally thousands of years.bluestone quarries, at Carn Goedog, Pembrokeshore, west Wales (Adam Stanford, Aerial-Cam Ltd)Long before Stonehenge itself was built, the area had become ceremonially and ritually important by at least 4000BC.The site had at least one or two large natural sarsen stones which may\u0026nbsphave been used as a focus for pre-Stonehenge ritual activity.Ancient British stone circles were used for ‘Neolithic parties’Stonehenge tunnel \u0027could destroy traces of human life from Ice Age\u0027Ancient Italian Stonehenge accidentally discovered by friendsScientists claim Stonehenge used to be in WalesBy at least 3500BC, elites from western Britain (or at least with western British, potentially south Welsh, connections) began to be associated with the developing sacred landscape of the area.Then in around 3000BC, western British people (from southwest Wales) further developed their links with the Wiltshire area, by transporting dozens of large stones (and the cremated remains of many of their dead) from southwest Wales to a site they had earmarked for the creation of the first version of Stonehenge.Archaeologists now believe that the stones may well have originally been from a stone circle or other monument in southwest Wales which was entirely “uprooted” and transported some 200 miles to Wiltshire and re-erected as a stone circle there.33BC and 28BC\u0026nbsp(Christie Willis, UCL)The recent scientific analysis of the Stonehenge cremated bones (that appear to have been buried adjacent to the newly re-erected stones) is now helping to reveal the origins of the community, which appears to have actually built the earliest version of the\u0026nbspmonument.It is the strontium and carbon isotopic signatures in the cremated bone material that suggest a western British origin for the 10 iniduals\u0026nbsp– and definitely not from the Stonehenge area. The carbon signal, absorbed into the bones from the timber used in the funerary pyre, also suggests a Western or non-local origin.Geologically, previous research has shown that the stones (so-called bluestones or dolerite, used for the early phase of Stonehenge) also came from western Britain (in this case, the Preseli mountains in southwest Wales). Archaeological investigations have now pinpointed the quarries they actually came from – and when they were quarried (some time between the 34th and the 32nd century BC).“The new isotopic evidence shows the scale and frequency of interactions between communities hundreds of miles apart,” said one of the project’s leaders, John Pouncett of Oxford University’s School of Archaeology.“In the past, the research focus at Stonehenge has mainly been on the stones themselves. Now we are beginning to make tremendous progress in understanding the people and the community which built Stonehenge,” said the project’s osteologist, Christina Willis of University College London’s Institute of Archaeology.UCL)The research was carried out by archaeologists and other scientists from the University of Oxford, UCL, the Free University of Brussels, and the Museum of Natural History in Paris and is being published\u0026nbsptoday by the online\u0026nbspjournal\u0026nbspNature Scientific Reports.The ever-increasing body of evidence suggesting Stonehenge and the original Stonehenge community’s western British origins has substantial implications for our understanding of British prehistory.Firstly, it demonstrates the extremely broad geographical horizons that the builders of Stonehenge had. It shows that, despite agriculture increasingly tying people to the land, at least certain sections of society were well travelled and almost certainly had family connections spread across thousands of square miles.Secondly, it shows the lengths that prehistoric people were prepared to go to achieve seemingly non-utilitarian objectives – i.e. the realisation of spiritual or ceremonial aspirations.Thirdly, it suggests the possibility that the western origin of Stonehenge was so\u0026nbspimportant and memorable that it was celebrated across the millennia through collective memory and epic storytelling passed on across the generations. Potential evidence of this is\u0026nbspthe Arthurian story of the magician Merlin, who transports the stones of Stonehenge from the west. The\u0026nbspMerlin story describes how the stones\u0026nbspcame from Ireland – but southwest Wales is certainly close enough to Ireland, and also has\u0026nbspimportant Irish connections. The story was first written during the medieval times – but may well have had its roots in prehistoric collective memory.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/29/17/chequers-final-say.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1435  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/29/17/chequers-final-say.jpg","title":"brexit theresa may emmanuel macron france talks eu leave uk trade deal germany","story":"Created with Sketch.Ex-ambassador says ministers must stop\u0026nbspno-deal threats as EU aware of lack of planningClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit: Theresa May warned Emmanuel Macron unlikely to \u0027soften\u0027 France\u0027s stance ahead of key talksTheresa May should not expect Emmanuel Macron\u0026nbspto\u0026nbsp”soften” his stance towards Brexit\u0026nbspas she gears up for talks at his holiday retreat,\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspformer ambassador to France has warned.Lord Peter Ricketts urged\u0026nbspministers against brandishing threats of a no-deal\u0026nbspexit from the bloc, as the EU knows\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspwarnings of walking away\u0026nbspwithout an agreement with Brussels are “a bluff”.His comments came after Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, told French and German leaders to intervene to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU, as he warned the prospect of\u0026nbspno deal\u0026nbspwas “increasing by the day”.Later, an Elysee Palace offical said the meeting between Ms May and Mr Macron is “not a negotiation”, and would not substitute for a discussion with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, and whom has Mr Macron’s “full trust”.The prime minister has cut short her holiday in the Italian Lakes to meet with the French president on Friday\u0026nbspat his retreat,\u0026nbspFort Bregancon, on the French Riviera, while her senior ministers have been attempting to woo European leaders through a series of high-level visits.Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, is\u0026nbspdue to hold talks in Paris today ahead of a meeting with UK and French leaders.Lord Ricketts told the Today programme: “I would have said let’s not go out and brief everyone that Theresa May is going to France to try and get Macron to soften the French position. I don’t see why there is any chance of that.“First of all he doesn’t believe in softening it, he is a passionate pro-European.

In its quarterly earnings outlook, the group said nominal pay growth in the UK is set to hover around or slightly below its current level of 2.7 per cent over the coming months, which is says is “well below its pre-crisis average of 4.5 per cent”.This historically weak pay growth “in part reflects the fact that there is greater slack in the labour market than many economists previously expected”, the Resolution Foundation said. “However, wider evidence indicates that pay pressures have built in recent months as slack has reduced. Nominal pay has bounced back after a slight dip following the referendum, and has been above 2.5 per cent for the past six months.”Meanwhile, pay growth for people who moved jobs in the last year hit 11 per cent in 2018, the highest it has been since 2011, while for those who stayed with their employer, growth was stuck at 2.5 per cent, below the average. However, the foundation said: “Despite the growing pay premium for moving jobs, the proportion of workers who have voluntarily switched employment recently is well down on pre-crisis levels, with just 3 per cent of workers having done so in the last 12 months, compared to an average of 4 per cent in the years before the crisis.”The Bank of England’s decision to raise interest rates above 0.5 per cent for the first time since the financial crisis could indicate that its monetary policy committee sees the weak earnings growth recorded recently as being “as good as it gets”, according to the think tank. More than half of UK people feel proud of their jobs, study suggestsPeople are happier at work – but nearly half of us may move onIf MPC members believed that pay growth had cope to improve further, “such a view would underpin the case for holding off on a rise until this stronger pay growth materialises”. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspStephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said that, despite the growing ‘disloyalty bonus’, young workers in particular seem reluctant to make the move. “While overall pay growth remains weak, interest rate hawks may take the view that, bad as it is, this is still as good as it gets. Those holding off on rate rises may take the view however that recent small upticks in pay pressure mean that things can only get better,” he added.Figures from the Office for National Statistics earlier this month showed UK wage growth had slowed to its weakest pace in half a year in the three months to May. Average total pay was up 2.5 per cent on a year earlier, down from the 2.6 per cent rate in April and the slowest since November 2017.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/30/11/India-assam-0.jpg","title":"india assam register citizens bangladesh voting rolls","story":"Created with Sketch.Government claims that hundreds of thousands of people illegally entered country from neighbouring Bangladesh since 1971Click to followThe Independent OnlineResidents queue to check their names on the final list of the National Register of Citizens India has effectively stripped 4\u0026nbspmillion people from the state of Assam of their citizenship.\u0026nbspThe state has a National Register of Citizens (NRC), which includes the names of all those who can prove they came to the state before 24 March 1971 – the day before Bangladesh declared independence.\u0026nbspIndia has now released a final draft of a list of its citizens, leaving some 4\u0026nbspmillion people to prove their Indian nationality.Force India in administration but to see out rest of the F1 seasonMan accused of cow smuggling beaten to death by mob in IndiaIndia on brink of biggest gay rights victory since independence India tourism ministry launches campaign to highlight safety of women It says hundreds of thousands of people have illegally entered the country from neighbouring Bangladesh over decades and settled down in the northeast – a claim which Bangladesh rejects.\u0026nbspThe application process for inclusion in India’s national register started in 2015.

Farage fury after Mandelson SLATES Brexit while waiting for EU pension                Brexit BOMBSHELL: Barnier warns UK is heading for BLIND EU exitShe also claimed five Remain groups registered as permitted participants in the last week of the campaign, receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds from previous BSIE donors and targeting the same audience, with the same messages.It is therefore wholly reasonable to believe that these campaigns were set up for the sole purpose of BSIE evading its spending limit, with a \u0027common plan\u0027 in both their messaging and audience, she claimed.The referendum rules allowed campaigners to work together as long as they declared spending and did not exceed their inidual spending limits.When coordination involved a designated lead campaign, like BSIE or Vote Leave, all spending counted towards that group\u0027s legal spending limit.pro-Brexit Conservative former Cabinet Minister Priti Patel (Image: )The Electoral Commission said it found no evidence to support complaints about joint working on pro-Remain videos, produced by the agency DDB, also known as Adam and Eve.DDB was a registered campaigner which incurred and correctly reported its video spending, said the watchdog.In this matter there is not sufficient grounds to suspect that BSIE breached the joint spending rules.It also ruled that DDB providing services to more than one campaigner, or BSIE hosting another group\u0027s video on its own website were not on their own evidence of joint working as part of a common plan.Thousands take to the streets of London for Brexit march.                    PA1 of 21People took to the streets of London to march for a second EU referendumRegarding groups that registered with just a month to go before voting day, and allegations they had a common plan, the watchdog said: The Commission has not been provided with or found evidence for an investigation to be opened.However, the Commission has opened a probe into whether the group Wake Up And Vote incurred undeclared joint spending with DDB.A Vote Leave spokesperson said the Commission had finally admitted that the evidence points to supposedly separate Remain campaigns in fact working together.But the actions by the Remain side go way beyond these findings.EU countries\u0027 leaders meet on 28 and 29 June for a summit to discuss migration in general, the installation of asylum-seeker processing centres in northern Africa, and other security- and economy-related topics including Brexit.                    REUTERS1 of 36Hungarian Prime Minister Vickor Orban talks to German Chancellor Angela MerkelThe Commission claims there is insufficient evidence to investigate the allegations put forward by Priti Patel, yet it appears the Commission has not even bothered to ask basic questions of the Remain campaigns in question.This is in stark contrast to the Commission\u0027s actions on the Leave side, where flimsier allegations were enough for the Commission to open up multiple inquiries, and subject Leave campaigns to a multi-year onslaught, ending in findings that Vote Leave confidently expects to be dismissed when we appeal.The spokesperson said BSIE reached its donation limit a month before the referendum and a group of new Remain groups suddenly sprang to life as if from nowhere, getting donations from people who had bankrolled BSIE, using the same ad agencies and campaign material, and giving to each other.Their spending added up to well over a million pounds - but the Electoral Commission declares: \u0027move on, nothing to see here\u0027, said the spokesperson.Remainers are finding it hard to accept Brexit. 1 of 14One day the Commission will decide to look into the wrongdoings of the Remain campaign with the same vigour with which it has investigated unsubstantiated claims against Leave.The Commission previously rejected a complaint that reported daily conference calls between BSIE and other Remain groups were evidence of joint working that demanded investigation.When that ruling came out, in January, Ms Patel said it looked like double standards for the Commission to dismiss clear evidence of Remain campaigns colluding but to launch a full inquiry into Vote Leave despite no evidence of joint planning with fellow Brexit group BeLeave.

Each of the 751 EU lawmakers are entitled to the entirely taxpayer-funded perk.The shiftier of the MEPs can effectively pocket the entire amount to top up their eye-watering regular pre-tax monthly salary of \u0026euro8,611.Last month, the 15-man Bureau, the Parliament\u0026rsquos governing body, voted down modest proposals to introduce a level of accountability for how GEA funds are spent in a behind-closed doors meeting in Strasbourg.The rejected proposals would have seen MEPs handing back unspent money at the end of their five-year term and accurate expenses records kept.And now, the documents from the July 2 meeting are being kept secret after an access request by EU Observer was rejected in order to protect future GEA discussions.The Parliament\u0026rsquos secretary-general Klaus Welle declined to release information on the working group and a letter by its chairman Rainer Wieland, a German MEP and Bureau member.Mr Welle argued the working group\u0026rsquos task is too \u0026ldquosensitive to publish and requires a \u0026ldquorelation of trust with the bureau to properly function.The powerful official said the expense system\u0026rsquos rules have been \u0026ldquointensely debated and give rise to litigation.In his letter, Mr Welle wrote: \u0026ldquoIn this context, parliament considers that the publication of Mr Wieland\u0027s letter and of the decision proposal would put at stake its ability to discuss GEA issue thoroughly.

Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism.

My word, though, after the briefest of mobile phone interruptions, the sexual chemistry was fair zinging between Annabel Giles and her first date.“Was that your mum?”“No, my mum is dead.”“I’m probably the same age as your mum. How old is she?” She’s still dead, Annabel.If anything though, romantic developments were even less promising back at the girls’ villa on Naxos, where we learnt: “A goat escaped its pen and spent the night in Ingrid Tarrant’s room. There’s poo everywhere.”Whether the poo belonged to the goat or Ingrid, I’m still not 100 per cent sure, but I’m hoping the local match-maker flagged up “a potential bowel issue” with her first date, George, an absolute ringer forHarvey Weinstein, whose background caused a surprising amount of excitement.“He lives in Crete,” Ingrid squealed down the phone to her daughter.“So do they call them Cretins?” Only if he asks for a second date, Ingrid (ITV, Thursday, 9pm).Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is an orchestrated plot, backed by millions of pounds . . . a script written the day Remain lost the referendum.The plan was always to reverse defeat by throwing up endless obstacles, by concocting myriad excuses to de-legitimise a vote they would never have questioned had they won . . .  and by relaunching Project Fear to terrify the country about the consequences.Like minds among MPs and the media would amplify each other’s panic in a feedback loop reaching a deafening howl. And they are succeeding. A year ago they seemed resigned to Brexit’s inevitability, but focused on one so soft as to be indistinguishable from Remain.Now, boosted by Government ineptitude, they dream of going one better: a second referendum, its three options cynically designed to skew the result towards staying in, exactly as we are.For two years they lied that they “respect the referendum result”. In truth they hope to annul it before it has even been carried out. And THEIR victory, in the unlikely event it occurred, would of course be final and beyond reproach.It should all be laughable. But No10 is turbo-charging their hopes with the new Project Fear, a barrage of dubious warnings of chaos, recession and wartime shortages in the event of no-deal.The Sun long ago urged the Government to plan seriously for this scenario. But No10 is also using it to intimidate Leave voters into swallowing Theresa May’s wildly unpopular Chequers offer.This not only does the dirty work of the second referendum mob. It paints Britain into a corner with Brussels — with Chequers seemingly our only option and the Government petrified of Angela Merkel finally rejecting it. The Sun always said Brexit could be rocky. Far worse would be to reverse it.Remainers say Leavers shouldn’t want “Brexit chaos on their conscience”. Would it trouble theirs to overturn the biggest UK democratic mandate ever, before its instruction had been fulfilled?To negate the sworn pledges of the Government and Opposition, and Commons votes carried by huge majorities? What about the destruction of trust in democracy? The inevitable breakdown of law and order? Would riots bother them? Or our great nation being humiliated before the world, scaring itself into surrender and begging Brussels’ forgiveness?Or are they simply in denial about the hideous costs of what they propose?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or call Hamas terrorists “brother” after they have helped slaughter Jews.Or discipline two veteran MPs who accused him over anti-semitism . . . but not an actual anti-semite in Willsman.This is the dark heart of the man Labour wants to install in Downing Street.We don’t just mean the hard-left muppets on his front bench.

Tourists in Spain and Portugal clearly need to take care in such high temperatures.“Continental heat will move up to Britain from the south. The low 30s are possible from Friday to Sunday.“The South and East will be hottest and it will be a warm weekend for most, although cooler in the North.”The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Record-breaking heat in Spain and Portugal is forecast to approach 50C.“In Britain, Friday could be as hot as last Friday, with 34C not out of the question.“Then, as furnace heat over Spain moves northwards over the weekend, computer models indicate temperatures in southern England rising to 36C.British tourists holidaying across mainland Europe over the next 10 days have been warned to take extra care in the heat, and have been advised to remain out of the sun and to ensure they drink plenty of water.The increased temperatures could cause a surge in heat-related deaths as Brits are warned to stay hydrated with water and diluted fruit juices, and avoid being out in the sun too long.The elderly, infants and those with pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are most at risk of death during a heatwave.However, the silver lining for Britain is that the economy is thought to be getting a boost of around £31billion as more people holiday here instead of abroad.Brits are also spending more on sunshine-related treats such as outdoor dining.The recent rain provided a much-needed respite for Britains water supply with United Utilities calling off its hosepipe ban which was due to start on August 5.A spokesman said the rainfall had gone some way to helping with water supplies”.The current record was set on July 10, 1977 in Athens, when the temperature reached 48.0C.Spain’s record is 47.3C, set in 2017 while Portugal’s is 47.4C, set in 2003.Temperatures across Southern France are also set to soar, with highs of around 40C expected within days.At least 27 of Spain’s 50 provinces have been declared an “extreme risk” as temperatures look set to begin soaring rapidly from Thursday.The worst of the heat is set to strike the Iberian Peninsula, close to the border of Portugal, where almost 11,000 firefighters and 56 aircraft are on standby to tackle forest fires."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424197182.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pregnant mum emergency c section anaesthesia california","story":"Delfina Mota was rushed in for the operation when medics at Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, California, were unable to detect her babys heart rate during labour.A lawsuit she filed against the hospital says staff paged the on-call anaesthesiologist several times and waited nine minutes before taking her into theatre.Ms Mota recalled in excruciating detail how she felt a knife cut into her belly and screaming for doctors to stop before she lost consciousness.She told NBC 7 it was something like out of a horror movie.Ms Mota said: Once I felt it, I was just screaming like, stop. I can feel it. And after that Im pretty sure I passed out from the pain.Her fiance, Paul Iheanachor, was outside the room but could hear her screaming before it went quiet.He said: I just tried to wrap my mind around how it would feel to basically be gutted like a fish.If somebody put a knife in your stomach and cut you open, and had their hands on your insides, and ripped your baby out, you know.According to the lawsuit, Mr Iheanachor was trying to get into the room to be with his partner but was restrained by hospital employees.It also alleges that the operation went ahead after the delivery team made several failed attempts to contact anaesthesiologist Dr David Seif.Emergency C-sections are routinely carried out when the doctors believe the mother or baby is in distress and a natural birth would be more risky.The procedure is safe but still a huge op so anaesthesia is required so that the woman is numb and cant feel any pain during the delivery.Ms Mota and her daughter Cali are physically in good health, but the new mum says shes been left traumatised by the birth.She said: Its probably going to stay with me for the rest of my life.A spokesperson from the hospital was not immediately available for comment.A representative of the Anesthesia Service Medical Group (ASMG), of which Dr Seif is a member, denied the allegations specified in the lawsuit.They said: “The group, on behalf of Dr Seif, is confident that anaesthesia services would have been available, and were available.“Additionally, the group and Dr Seif are confident that the care provided by Dr Seif was appropriate under the circumstances.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000335575098.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"london jobs brexit","story":"The exodus never materialised as firms were reassured by a planned two-year transition period following March’s Brexit day.Many also now expect a deal to be done to maintain reasonable access to the continent’s trade under the EU’s “equivalence” rules.The City has been given an additional big boost by the rise of new tech jobs.The City of London Corporation had originally estimated that the capital could lose more than a third of its half a million financial sector workers.It now puts the number at between 5,000 and 13,000.The financial services sector is a crucial cash cow for the nation, providing a massive 11 per cent of all tax receipts — £72billion in 2017.The analysis was revealed by Lord Mayor of the City of London Charles Bowman.He told the website Politico: “If we are to lose some of the jobs, they are going to be the jobs that probably in five to ten years’ time are not going to be around.The joining of technology with finance at this moment in time is creating a very different dynamic.”If no Brexit deal is struck City job losses could still be considerably higher, with the Bank of England estimating 10,000 will go on day one.Now the City of London Corporation forecast is 5,000.

For having believed the “lies” of the Brexit campaign.But it is hard to imagine anyone could be quite so stupid as to really believe we’ll be short of food if we tell our European friends to shove their deal where the sun doesn’t shine.They even had a debate on Remainer Central (that’s BBC Newsnight to you and me) about what we could put in our sandwiches if we fail to sign a deal. Basically it came down to Kirsty Wark’s toenail clippings and Evan Davis’s nostril hair. That’s your lot.Do they really think we’re that stupid? We’re not at war, you know.

Or that we would refuse to buy their produce? Get real.The debate about whether we should leave or remain in the EU was pretty shoddy. There was exaggeration and outlandish claims made by both sides.I never believed the rubbish about an extra £350million a week for the NHS.

Nope. Instead we’re busy sorting out new trade deals with, among others, Japan and Australia. Employment is booming, unemployment is the lowest for decades, wages are rising and inflation is coming down.And so the Project Fearmongers dream up another nightmare scenario which exists only in their weird imaginations.

It’s hard to think of something more obviously anti-Semitic.But why did he apologise? He still thinks the same thing.He has never met with a senior Israeli government member. He has gone out of his way to avoid meeting the Israeli Prime Minister. He has called the genocidal Islamist terrorists Hamas his “friends”. He has failed to take action against the virulent Jew-hating in his party.He’s not sorry at all about having attended that foul gathering.He’s only sorry it got him into more bother.So, an anti-Semite and a hypocrite.Salman repaid that kindness by murdering 22 children and adults at the Manchester Arena.The lesson? Disengage with these foul Islamist countries. Leave them to it.

It provided an estimate of the \"trend real interest rate\", what it calls R*.While this used to be around 5% before the crisis, the Bank said it was currently about half that, at 2-3%, once inflation is included. It indicates that although interest rates are now on the rise, they are highly unlikely to hit pre-crisis levels of above 5% for the foreseeable future.In its Inflation Report, the Bank raised its GDP growth forecast for this year slightly, from 1.4% to 1.5%, and lifted next year\u0027s GDP forecast from 1.7% to 1.8%.It also predicted that inflation would be 0.1 percentage points higher this year and next at 2.5% and 2.2% respectively.It is that relatively high level of inflation - above the Bank\u0027s 2% target - that helps explain their decision to raise the cost of borrowing. While the economy remains weaker than its long-term average, the Bank pointed out that with productivity also weak and unemployment low, the chances were employers would have to increase wages, which would further push up prices.   In a further sign of the strength of the labour market, the Bank cut its unemployment forecast in the coming years, predicting for the first time that the jobless rate would drop beneath 4%, to 3.9%.Following the Bank\u0027s decision, The Royal Bank of Scotland and its NatWest and Ulster Bank North subsidiaries also increased their base rates from 0.50% to 0.75%.The group said: \"For those customers on Base Rate Linked products, we will increase their rate to 0.75%."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-cash-money-uk-money_4370246.jpg?20180724143832 ","title":"do you remember where you were in march 2009","story":"But now, at last, the period of crisis-era rates is coming to an end.

Mainly because this decision - highly symbolic as it might be - was actually unusually uncontroversial. Every one of the nine MPC members voted for it - the first time there has been unanimity for a rate increase in more than a decade.The move was widely anticipated in financial markets. And the Bank said that while it would take a tiny bit off economic growth, it was unlikely to leave a major dent in the economy. Many people within the economy fraternity have spent the past decade or so fretting about what higher interest rates would do to households. Now it has happened why is everyone so relaxed about it?In part, it is because that is precisely what the Bank and its governor, Mark Carney, had planned for. So much of their effort over the past few years, from forward guidance to speeches on this matter, has been aimed at trying to ready the country for the fact that borrowing costs would have to eventually return to normal.The message seems to have been received.On the surface, the statistics suggest that the country should be able to absorb the extra costs.For households which are net savers, the consequent increase in savings rates, after nearly a decade of near-zero returns, should come as an immense relief."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-macron_4331049.jpg?20180608162011 ","title":"emmanuel macron wont allow theresa may to bypass brussels over brexit","story":"The French president was described as having full trust in Mr Barnier and in the EU chief Brexit negotiator\u0027s response to Mrs May\u0027s Brexit proposals, an Elysee Palace official said.The prime minister has cut short her current holiday in Italy in order to meet Mr Macron, with the French president said to have invited Mrs May for talks following a request for a meeting by Downing Street.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have both met their respective French counterparts already this week, with UK ministers launching a charm offensive on EU capitals this summer in order to sell Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan.Earlier on Thursday, Mr Barnier repeated his opposition to the prime minister\u0027s proposals, as thrashed out by ministers at a Chequers meeting last month and subsequently published in a government white paper.

Writing exclusively for the Mirror, the former Cabinet Minister and Greater Manchester Mayor urges Chancellor Philip Hammond to release cash for roads and rail investment across the region. The ex-Labour MP’s intervention comes after the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, chaired by Mr Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne, organised a letter signed by 84 MPs and peers from all three main parties calling on the Treasury to pledge cash to revolutionise roads and railways in the North.  Partnership vice-chairman and former Treasury Minister Lord Jim O’Neill said: “Getting a true state-of-the-art transport network is absolutely key. “Affordable and quick trains connecting all key parts of the Powerhouse are vital to delivering on the goal of raising productivity both across the North, and with it, the country as a whole.” Mr Burnham tonight echoed the plea in an article for the Mirror. He says: “More than 80 politicians from across the political spectrum have come together to write to the Chancellor demanding \u0026pound100billion of transport investment in the North over the next three decades. “This isn’t some luxury we’re requesting – all we are asking for is our fair share.  “We’re coming together in the North – and our voice is getting stronger.” The Mirror told yesterday how pressure was growing for Mr Hammond to open the spending taps. And Mr Burnham links the need for investment with the ongoign row over rail chaos in the North. He writes: On Saturday night, at 9.40pm, I received an email from Northern Rail saying that many trains to Manchester Airport were being cancelled the next day.  The public weren’t told this until the next morning – when the cancellations were all happening and passengers’ days were being ruined. This is what we have come to expect from the train operators in the North. The travelling public are simply treated with contempt. It has to end. I’ve been accused by the Transport Secretary of trying to score political points on this issue. But it’s got nothing to do with that – it’s about people’s lives. I’ve heard story after story of commuters at the end of their tether because for months it’s been a lottery if they are going to get into work or not. Businesses are telling me about the money they’ve lost because of the chaos.  The Government does not have control of this – and they need to get a grip. We asked them for control of the rail franchises, as it’s always better when the people on the ground are in charge. Instead they offered us a partnership. Partnerships are great – but they only work when everyone plays their part. The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling couldn’t even be bothered to turn up when he was meant to be the main speaker at a Northern transport conference. That’s why action needs to be taken, and why I have written to Theresa May asking her to personally intervene and take charge.

Unfortunately, I am not laughing. In fact, the situation now is so crazy it is catastrophic and, instead of writing a new script, I am urging people to take back control and support the campaign for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal. I’m doing so because I believe that, over the last two years, our political leaders have let all of us down, whether we voted for or against Brexit. Two years ago, immediately after the referendum, we were told by both sides that the decision to leave was the biggest thing to hit the United Kingdom since the Second World War. It was a crisis, and what do we do in times of crisis? We come together. That is what we should have done. There should have been a cross-party and inclusive group to conduct the negotiations and we should have worked on a proposal that would, at the minimum, have appealed to a majority of those who voted in the referendum.  The last general election even returned a hung Parliament – a sign that the people did not think one party could do this on its own. Instead, what Theresa May has done is to limit the debate to the agenda of warring factions inside her own party. Everyone else – all of us – has been shut out. In the last two years we have seen no progress and, in that time, a whole new generation of voters, who were not allowed to vote two years ago, have now become eligible but have been forced to watch while their future is debated in front of them and they have no say whatsoever.

Dame Martina Milburn, who was appointed to a post left empty for six months, also rejected the idea that the gender pay gap was stifling social mobility and should fall within her remit. The former journalist who went on to hold senior charity roles replaced former Labour minister Alan Milburn who quit the post along with the rest of his team, in frustration at what they saw as the Tories’ lack of commitment to the issue. But Dame Martina denied the impact of devastating cuts on life chances. “I don’t think the stats show that it has, actually, oddly, because you would think that it would, but as I understand it social mobility has been quite flat for a long time,” she said in an interview with HuffPost UK. Her comments will alarm many of those who have been dismayed by the government’s seeming lack of interest in social mobility - despite commitments made by Theresa May.  And they would seem to contradict evidence from respected thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) which published evidence last November showing that child poverty is set to rise significantly between 2015-16 and 2021-22 as a direct result of benefit cuts. It found that absolute child poverty would increase by around 4 percentage points on the government’s official measure during that period with around three-quarters - equal to 400,000 children, attributable to benefit changes. The freeze to most working-age benefits means that around 7.5 million low income households will see their benefit entitlements cut by over \u0026pound500 per year in real terms. The limiting of tax credits and universal credit to two children means that some low income families will receive over \u0026pound2,500 less in benefits than they otherwise would have.  Research from the Resolution Foundation released this week found that child poverty is projected to have increased last year by around 3 per cent - more than previously thought. It blamed this on benefit cuts that particularly hit low-income families, including the 3 per cent real-terms fall in the value of tax credits and child benefit. However it also found that in contrast to rises in poverty, inequality has remained broadly flat since 2010-11. The IFS also found earlier this month that per-pupil spending on schools had fallen by 8% since 2010. Since education is widely seen as key in improving life chances this would also challenge Dame Martina’s separation of government cuts from the drop in social mobility outlined by the outgoing commission in a damning report last year. Theresa May vowed to tackle the “burning injustices” in society when she became prime minister was widely criticised for taking so long to appoint a successor to Mr Milburn who quit in December. Recently-appointed Education Secretary Damian Hinds has renewed the government’s commitment by pledging to halve the number of children who start school without basic communication skills by 2028. But Labour have been keen to point out that the Tories have slashed the funding for Sure Start centres by half which were designed to help parents support their kids in the crucial early years.

It follows reports that the Labour leader planned to hold an event at the museum, in Camden, London, tomorrow afternoon. A senior Labour source confirmed no event is planned for Friday, and no event next week had been confirmed. But a sources at the museum said talks are ongoing.  Abigail Morris, the museum\u0027s chief executive, told the Jewish Chronicle the museum would absolutely be open to hosting the Labour leader for an event as long as it is done carefully and sensitively.  She added: We are still trying to work out what [Mr Corbyn’s office] is asking from us — whether it is a discussion, a statement or a speech. “Things are very delicate at the moment. But the Jewish Museum is all about building bridges, and sometimes that’s hard.  “We would want to be part of a healing process — not something that will make things worse. We are very proud of being a cross-communal space and we want to be a place where positive dialogue can take place.” There has been speculation Mr Corbyn intends to use the speech to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u0027s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism in full. Labour\u0027s row is about its new code of conduct on anti-Semitism. This is a set of rules, approved by Labour\u0027s NEC, to decide if a member\u0027s remarks are racist and should get them expelled. Critics are angry that Labour\u0027s code does not match a widely-accepted code from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). So what\u0027s the difference? Labour has adopted the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, word for word. But it has not adopted all the IHRA\u0027s examples of possible anti-Semitic behaviour. The four examples Labour has not adopted are:  Accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country Claiming that Israel\u0027s existence as a state is a racist endeavour Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations and Comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis.  Supporters say this is because Labour\u0027s examples are likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic. The IHRA examples are only anti-Semitic once the overall context is taken into account - a weaker threshold. Labour\u0027s code also adds insults like kike and yid to the examples. Critics say the discrepancy means those using conspiracy theories or comparing Israel to Nazi Germany will go unpunished."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove discussed keeping britain","story":"NewsMichael Gove \u0027discussed\u0027 keeping Britain in the EU single market after Brexit with Tory colleaguesThe Environment Secretary reportedly raised the idea of a Norway-style deal to stay in the EEAShare\u0026nbspByMikey SmithPolitical reporter14:23, 2 AUG 2018Updated14:24, 2 AUG 2018NewsHe reportedly raised the topic at a private dinner of Tory MPs (Image: AFP)Get politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Michael Gove has discussed with Tory MPs the idea of keeping Britain inside the EU single market to avoid a no deal Brexit , it has been reported.

As things stand, Brexit will come into force at the end of March 2019.  But it could be 2022 before you notice any difference - and the path to the door is littered with obstacles. Some believe Brexit can be stopped. Others fear it could bring down the Government. Here\u0027s a list of the questions about Brexit most people are asking Google for help with - and the answers as they stand. 1. What is Brexit?  Brexit is Britain\u0027s exit from the European Union. That means leaving its single market and customs union, cutting legal ties, ending the automatic right for EU citizens to move to Britain, and reducing or ending budget payments to Brussels.  At the moment it looks likely. There are campaigns with multi-million pound backing, such as Best For Britain, that are trying to halt the process as we know it. But stopping Brexit would probably need a second referendum. And while some recent polls have seen an uptick of support for that idea, there\u0027s very little political will from the people actually in charge for that to happen. Both Tory Boris Johnson and Labour\u0027s John McDonnell have warned of a public backlash if there was any attempt to overturn the referendum result. Labour has insisted it is not backing a second referendum. But several times, senior Labour figures have refused to rule out backing one in future. And many backbench MPs openly back a second referendum, or a referendum on the terms of whatever deal Theresa May manages to negotiate with Brussels - which they call a \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027.  Britain officially leaves the EU at 11pm on 29 March 2019. But a transition period has been agreed, which means almost all current rules continue until New Year\u0027s Eve 2020. Then there is also a customs \u0027backstop\u0027 (see below) which could continue EU rules into 2021, or even 2022. However, the deadline to agree the main deal is around October 2018, because it needs time to be agreed by MPs and the European Parliament.  4. When was the Brexit vote?   The Brexit referendum took place on June 23, 2016.  5. How many people voted for Brexit?     The UK voted 52%-48% in 2016 to leave the 28-nation body after almost 50 years. Out of an electorate of 46,501,241 people, 17,410,742 voted to leave, with 16,141,241 voting to Remain. The turnout was 72.2%  6. What does Brexit stand for?    The word Brexit is a combination of Britain and exit - meaning Britain\u0027s exit from the EU. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word was coined by journalist Peter Wilding in a 2012 blog for EURACTIV, a European news outlet. He told EURACTIV last year: The brutal truth of it is I wrote this blog post, and then promptly forgot all about it. “Until this summer I got a phone call saying that the Oxford English Dictionary were going to put it in [the dictionary], and I realised I must have coined it.  7. Why did people vote for Brexit?    Many many reasons. Some simply voted for Brexit as a protest vote to kick back against the establishment. For about a third of people, according to polls, it was mostly about \u0027regaining control\u0027 of immigration. For about half- including a small group of Tory hardline Eurosceptics - it was about sovereignty. They were concerned that Britain had ceded too much control of its lawmaking to Brussels, and fears the European project would lead to \u0027ever closer union.\u0027 And they object to supranational bodies, like the European Court of Justice, having power over decisions they feel should be made by us alone. Since the Referendum, the Leave campaign have been strongly criticised for spreading misleading information in a bid to influence voters. Among the misleading information is the widely discredited claim, plastered on the side of the Vote Leave campaign bus, that \u0026pound350 million a week could clawed back from fees we send to the EU, which could then be spent on the NHS. Another misleading claim used in Vote Leave advertising was that Turkey was on the verge of being admitted to the EU, which it was not. Vote Leave were also found to have broken spending rules during the campaign.  8. How to stop Brexit? See #2 above.   9. What is the EU?    The European Union is made up of 28 countries - 27 after Brexit - who have come together for trade and security. It was originally set up as the European Economic Community in 1958 with six members: Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The EEC changed its name to the European Union (EU) in 1993. The founding states wanted to bind the peace of the Second World War and further economic links by removing trade barriers between the countries. The EU now includes the 19 eurozone countries who share the single currency.  The European Union is overseen by the Council of Europe - the 28 leaders of the member states. The leaders meet for a regular summits throughout the year and set the direction of the EU and decide major issues such as changing the treaty and foreign policy. They do not pass laws. The engine of the EU is the Commission. This is made up of 28 Commissioners, one from each country, and the President (Jean-Claude Juncker) who is elected by MEPs. Commissioners oversee the running of the EU, set budgets and tables legislation for adoption by the European Parliament. The European Parliament is made up of 751 MEPs who voted on legislation, elect the President and approve the budgets. To keep the French happy the Parliament is based in Brussels but sits for four days a month in Strasbourg. 10. How will Brexit affect house prices?

The discount retailer displayed a notice at the doorway requesting that patrons cover up when shopping in store, reports the Daily Post .  It reads: “For hygiene reasons, we respectfully request that all customers keep their shirts on whilst in the store during the hot weather.  “Thank you for your co-operation and enjoy the sun!” One Aldi shopper agreed with the decision saying: “I can see why they have done it. At the end of the day I don’t want people sweating all over the food I am picking up.” Another said: “It’s off-putting.

Elizabeth Johnson, 23, looks back at her time in secondary school with dread as she was mercilessly bullied for being overweight. Despite the name calling, Elizabeth, from Durham, would hide stashes of crisps in her bedroom to eat in secret - seeing her weight rocketed to 20.5 stone. But Elizabeth, a teacher, finally decided to take action when, at size 26, she dreaded getting in a bikini on a planned beach holiday to Marmaris, Turkey, with a slim university pal. After becoming a regular at the gym and a keen meal-planner, the young woman has dropped to a stunning 11.5 stone - losing the weight in just a year. Elizabeth dropped eight dress sizes and was proud to show off her svelte figure on holiday in a bikini for the first time since aged five in August 2016, even next to her \u0027petite\u0027 pal.  And now the school bulllies who once taunted Elizabeth over her weight routinely chatted up on nights out - but she is always quick to tell them where to go.   Elizabeth, from Durham, said: It\u0027s a massive difference. I am delighted. The funny thing is that since I lost the weight loads of the lads in secondary school that used to call me names and take the mick, they\u0027re always the ones on the night out trying to chat me up and stuff. I tell them where to go straight away. A lot of my friends I had in secondary school I\u0027m not friends with now because since I lost the weight they just drifted away. I think they must have liked me for being the fat friend that was just there. I was the token fat friend in the group. I was able to go on holiday and wear a bikini and everything which I probably haven\u0027t done since I was about five. I used to hate swimming - I just hated it. It was a really nice holiday. My friend is quite petite as well but I didn\u0027t feel out of place. We\u0027ve got loads of pictures and I just look like her. I look the same size as her and everything. It\u0027s hard because it took me a year to lose all the weight and I saw myself in the mirror every day, so even now looking at myself I still feel as though I\u0027m quite big compared to everyone.  But then when I look at a before and after picture it just shows how different I am. It takes other people to compliment me and say I look good because I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a massive change. I\u0027m still the same person - I still have the same personality and like the same things. It\u0027s just my body has completely changed. As a chubby child, Elizabeth had been bullied at secondary school for her weight and always felt like the token \u0027fat friend\u0027 with her mates. She tried dieting and even joined Weight Watchers while she was still at school - but would always give up after a few months and the pounds just kept piling on. At her heaviest, Elizabeth was 20 and a half stone. But that all changed when, three years ago, she and her \u0027skinny\u0027 friends started planning a girls\u0027 holiday abroad. At size 26, Elizabeth was terrified when she realised all her friends would be showing off their figures in skimpy bikinis. Elizabeth said: I\u0027ve always been overweight ever since I was a little girl. Even in primary school I was trying to lose weight. I did get bullied a lot at school, particularly at secondary school. But I remember the local nurse had to come in and weigh the children and I was so stressed about this for months knowing I would have to get weighed at school.  Secondary school was just awful. Absolutely awful. I started weight watchers when I was in secondary school but it just never worked. I was in my second year at university and my friends all decided that we were going to go on a girl\u0027s holiday. My friends are all thin and would be wearing bikinis and stuff. I was a size 26 massive girl. We were going to go in a year, so I thought \u0027I\u0027ve got a year to do something about it\u0027 and that\u0027s when I lost all the weight. Elizabeth teamed up with mum Louise Jobson, 42, to shift the pounds and the pair food shopped and meal planned together to curb their snacking habits. Elizabeth imposed a strict 6pm curfew on eating and stopped stashing crisps and sweets in her bedroom. Louise even joined her daughter the first time she went to the gym - and the young woman was delighted when she lost nearly two stone in just her first month. Elizabeth said: You\u0027ve got to be in the right mind-set to do it. Because I was doing it with my mam and I had her helping me to plan meals and encourage me, it really helps to have someone there because she came to the gym with me for the first time. She\u0027s my best friend. I absolutely love her. I couldn\u0027t have done it without her at all. When I was losing weight I cut down meals and stuff and bulked it out with vegetables and salads. Now because I know that I don\u0027t want to go back to how I was. I still eat how I would usually but then I know I\u0027ve got to go to the gym a bit more. It\u0027s more of an understanding of the balance between what you\u0027ve got to eat and how it affects your body.  My stomach just shrank. I used to eat loads and still be picking on stuff after my tea but now I can eat much less than I used to. I used to eat anything - up to five bags of crisps a day. I absolutely loved crisps, sweets, it was just really unhealthy. I\u0027m not allergic to anything, I don\u0027t not eat any food - so I would literally eat anything that was there. I used to take food and hide it in my room so when I went to bed I would eat loads of crisps and chocolate. I used to stash food so I could eat it in private. I didn\u0027t find it hard to lose weight, particularly after I started seeing results. In that first month I lost so much weight I started thinking I could actually do it.A glam young teacher who lost a staggering NINE STONE after being bullied throughout high school has confessed she now has to knock back advances from the same lads who once tormented her.

The only thing I could find was my iPhone earphones - I tied them to the cord and it was fine. Mr Cox praised the ambulance service for saving his baby daughter\u0027s life. He said: The call-taker deserves all the credit. While this happened, she was asking is the baby breathing, is the baby okay? With all the noise in the background, she could have lost her cool as well. We had it in our mind that the child was not going to be breathing. All the actions of the Scottis Ambulance Service ensured that our little girl survived and I can never thank them enough. The drama started when Mr Cox\u0027s wife Hayley, 32, started having intense pains in early January, although their daughter was not due until February 27.  She was in the bathroom at the couple\u0027s home in Rosyth, Fife, when she called out for her husband. Mr Cox said: She said \u0027Can you come to the bathroom?\u0027 Within a few minutes, I had our baby in my hands. My wife then said \u0027You need to phone 999\u0027. He added: It happened too fast, I could not grab the phone to call 999. At the hospital, I was saying I cannot believe this. I cannot remember if she was head first or what. The main priority was making sure she was breathing, and making sure her face was wiped. I did not appreciate she was born until the ambulance arrived. It\u0027s amazing how your instinct takes over.

The iconic motor was first seen in 1964’s Goldfinger and has appeared in seven Bond movies to date, most recently in 2015’s Spectre. It comes equipped with a host of gadgetry including a bullet-proof rear windscreen, in-built machine guns, tyre slashers – and an ejector seat. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang finished second in the poll, followed by Doc Brown\u0027s DeLorean from the Back to the Future trilogy. Herbie, the star of five movies so far, came fourth and the Batmobile, known as the Tumbler, from Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight flicks finished fifth.  The research of 2,000 UK adults was commissioned by Hyundai to celebrate the appearance of the Veloster, the KONA and the Santa Fe in new Marvel flick, Ant-Man and The Wasp, released in UK cinemas on 3 August. A spokesman for Hyundai, said: “Having our all-new Veloster immersed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a great way to entertain consumers and showcase the vehicle’s stylish design and performance capabilities to a massive audience.  “We wanted to take full advantage of this collaboration by engaging fans and providing them with experiences beyond the big screen.” Other popular vehicles include James Bond\u0027s Lotus Esprit S1 which featured in 1977’s The Spy Who Loved Me and Greased Lightning from 1978’s Grease. Charlie’s getaway Minis from 1969’s The Italian Job secured eighth spot, while the Ford Mustang GT Fastback from Steve McQueen’s Bullitt came ninth. Cars from Marvel movies appear several times - including Iron Man\u0027s Audi R8 from the first Iron Man flick and his Acura NSX Roadster concept from Avengers Assemble. Agent Coulson’s Lola from Avengers Assemble also made the list as well as Hank Pym\u0027s Triumph Spitfire from the first Ant-Man film.  The Batmobile features three times in the top 20 - the Tim Burton version (11), the one made famous by Adam West (10) and the Christopher Nolan version (5). Researchers also found six in 10 Brits think cars are an integral part of cinema history and around half said cars feature among their fondest movie memories.  Carried out through OnePoll , the study also identified the greatest car chases of all time.  Top spot went to the sequence from The Italian Job, followed by the chase in Bullitt and the scene from 1971’s The French Connection. Amid this, 55 per cent agree the ideal car chase should feature near misses, 32 per cent want to see motors driving into oncoming traffic and 29 per cent want crashes. Twenty-eight per cent think the perfect chase needs police cars, a quarter want to see pedestrians jumping out the way and a fifth want wheelies. And it should last for an average of four minutes and 23 seconds. A spokesman for Hyundai added: “In addition to the Veloster featuring in the latest Marvel film, we’ve also just unveiled our KONA Iron Man Edition SUV at Comic Con.

Colette Tomassi owed more than \u0026pound3,000 in rent to Hull City Council when she was removed from the property on July 10. The 38-year-old single parent was also allegedly booted out because of her behaviour, which the council said had had a “detrimental” effect on the neighbourhood.  After turning down emergency accommodation, Ms Tomassi and her children moved in with a friend in Bransholme and was able to rent two garages in Sheldon Close for \u0026pound18 a week to store her possessions and furniture, reports Hull Live .  However, she can no longer afford the fee and on August 8, she will have nowhere to store her belongings and she fears her family may soon be forced to wander the streets.  She said: “We are at a friend’s flat at the moment but I feel like I am outstaying my welcome and it is putting pressure on his relationship. “We are classed as homeless and I am devastated because I’m 38 and I’ve never been in this situation before. On Tuesday night we all went to sit in the garage at 10.30pm and my little one started crying. “He said ‘I’m not staying here anymore’ and he was crying his heart out. He ran back to the flat and wouldn’t stop crying. It was heartbreaking. “It’s awful to see my children like that and it’s stressing me out because I can’t do anything. We are all crammed into a living room with two on a double mattress, one on the settee and one on the chair with a pouffe.” Ms Tomassi had lived at the house in Porlock Drive for three years but said neighbours often complained about her son’s volatile behaviour which makes it difficult for him to control his anger.  She also suffered a huge health setback after being struck down with a heart attack in December 2016 and diagnosed with fibromuscular dysplasia – a condition which causes the arteries to narrow. After the heart attack, Ms Tomassi began struggling to pay her rent and due to health problems, she found it difficult to get her children to school on time. She developed anxiety and depression and claims her benefits were stopped with her now only receiving \u0026pound150 a fortnight in child tax credits.  She has appealed the eviction but to no avail and she thinks the council has not supported her enough during her current financial dilemma. Ms Tomassi said: “I just feel like the council haven’t given us a chance. I’ve tried to get the benefits back and I am doing my best but I’m not a miracle worker. “My Jobseeker’s Allowance stopped because I had no address and I need to reapply. Meals are hard to come by and the money I am on isn’t enough. “They want \u0026pound18 for these garages which I can’t afford to pay for and I’ve already paid \u0026pound300 back in rent. “Those garages are like a sauna and it’s not nice having to rifle through black bin bags for our belongings.

Lucy Beall-Lott, 19, has recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) which can cause her skin to shred-off and leave painful blisters and wounds. Since she was diagnosed at a few hours old, the teenager has needed to shield her fragile skin with bandages to prevent potentially deadly infection. But she has been taunted by strangers on the street, some of whom bizarrely asked if she was mauled by a gorilla.  And Lucy was traumatised when one of her exes told her he could never be attracted to her because of her skin. However, the Art History and Latin at the University of St Andrews has recently started modelling on the catwalk for lingerie brands. Lucy, originally from Santa Fei in New Mexico, USA, said: I never thought I\u0027d be doing underwear photoshoots. It\u0027s incredible, the comments I have received so far, they have been amazing. Starting to think that someone like me can be associated with beauty can change future women\u0027s perceptions of scarring, similar conditions and more. One of my exes told me he could \u0027never be attracted to me\u0027 because of my skin, it was very insensitive.  The teen, now living in Fife, east Scotland, added: I\u0027m used to comments where people have told me I looked diseased and things like that, so I was trying to change people\u0027s perceptions. So when I was asked to do a lingerie shoot, I did think back to his comment that I could \u0027never be attractive.\u0027 It\u0027s a nice feeling and seeing how I\u0027ve worked on my own body and I love myself enough to put my body out there like that. The catwalk was so empowering, I walked down the first one bare-foot, which I\u0027ve never done in public due to being too self-conscious of my scarring. Lucy often needs bandages to protect her skin as anything from a fall to opening a jar to brushing her teeth can cause open wounds. RDEB even affects Lucy\u0027s eating, as food grazes can appear on her throat. She said: I have had really positive, uplifting comments all the way to the extremely judgemental and callous remarks, as you can imagine.

A landmark study showed insulin-producing cells can be “rebooted” in many cases if weight loss is achieved before the cells have been killed off completely. Previous findings from the DiRECT study released last year showed almost half of sufferers could be cured by a strict diet of nutritional shakes and soups. Foods are then slowly introduced alongside counselling to how to live healthily. If rolled out nationally the scheme could cure at least 1.5 million of the 3.6 million British patients diagnosed with diabetes saving the NHS an estimated \u0026pound4 billion a year. Researchers at Newcastle University measured levels of fat in the liver and pancreas in 41 of the original study participants. Of these 29 were successfully put in remission and 16 were not.  After losing weight the insulin-producing beta cells of people in remission started to work properly again, releasing the right amount of insulin the body needs. Their insulin production continued to improve over the study. There was no change in the amount of insulin being made by non-responders as their beta cells had not survived the stress of being surrounded by too much fat. Dr Elizabeth Robertson, research director at Diabetes UK which funds the trials, said: “DiRECT has already provided evidence to suggest that some people can put their Type 2 diabetes into remission, but we didn’t yet know why. “This latest study builds on these promising findings and helps us understand how weight loss can help some people to kick-start their insulin production again. “DiRECT has the potential to transform the lives of millions of people. “We’re still waiting for all of the evidence, so it’s very important that anyone with Type 2 diabetes considering a low-calorie diet speaks to their diabetes healthcare professional first.” "},{"url":null,"title":"worlds smallest condom now exists","story":"NewsWorld\u0027s smallest condom now exists - and it could make a huge difference to your sex lifeUK-based company They Fit have made the world\u0027s smallest condom, as research shows millions of men search for smaller sizes online every dayShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer20:19, 2 AUG 2018Updated20:22, 2 AUG 2018NewsYou can now buy the world\u0027s smallest condom (Image: Cultura RF)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf you\u0027ve ever struggled to fit into a standard condom, don\u0027t worry, you are not alone.

Their research has shown that an increasing number of men are searching for smaller sized condoms every day. And now they may finally have a solution, as they have started selling the world\u0027s smallest condom.  A regular condom measures around 7.1 inches but this new, more inclusive, range of condoms are almost half the size.  They Fit have produced condoms which start at just 3.1 inches, with a width of 2.6cm and a nominal width of 4.1cm.  Wondering if the new condoms could be the right fit for you? The company\u0027s website poses several questions that may help you find out. Do you find that condoms are much too long for you? they ask.  Do they slip or fall off entirely during use? How about when you try supposedly small condoms that are labelled things like \u0027Snug\u0027, \u0027Iron Grip\u0027 or \u0027Close Fit\u0027? Do the problems remain? It\u0027s because such condoms aren\u0027t actually that much smaller.  The website features a series of graphics which highlight the lack of difference between a regular condom and smaller ones previously sold to the public.  Traditional small condoms, including those labelled \u0027Close Fit\u0027, \u0027Snug\u0027 and \u0027Iron Grip\u0027 aren\u0027t actually that different in size from regular condoms, they explain.  In fact all of these supposedly small condoms are still at least 7 inches long. They add that finding out a condom doesn\u0027t meet your size requirements is a very common problem. Indeed millions of men every single day are searching the internet for small condoms and a real solution to their problem. But it\u0027s not so much that you need a small condom - it\u0027s that traditional condoms are much too big for most men!

The iPhone maker\u0027s hit the figure today, making the company the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach the record valuation. Apple\u0027s market capitalisation was just under 950 billion US dollars on Tuesday, meaning it needed stock prices to rise around 7% to pass the trillion-dollar mark. Though it is rare for Apple shares to climb that much in a single day, it is not unprecedented - in July 2016 stock rose 6.5% in a day after financial results beat analysts\u0027 expectations. However, several other technology firms have seen their share price drop in the wake of recent financial results - most notably Twitter and Facebook last week after both reported slowing user growth.

This is not the end, that they hit $1 trillion. I view this as just kind of speaking to a new a stage of growth and profitability.  A key area for Apple in its results was iPhone sales - the company\u0027s flagship device. Analysts predicted iPhone sales to be up slightly on last year.

But even though we might not have to check our shoes for funnel webs and red backs, that doesn\u0027t mean we want to welcome those hairy, beady-eyed creepy crawlies into our homes. Summer is just not the ideal time if you\u0027re an arachnophobe. Although spiders don\u0027t necessarily prefer our houses to the outdoors, the heat draws them inside as they seek cooler climes - and us keeping our windows and doors ajar to stay cool seems like an open invite. Fortunately, there\u0027s an unlikely ingredient spiders despise that you can use to keep them away.  Apparently a simple essential oil completely puts them off coming inside our houses that doesn\u0027t involve any poison.  Goodtoknow says that peppermint oil is like a repellent for spiders - they absolutely hate it and will avoid at all costs.  All you need to do is grab a spray bottle, put a few drops of peppermint oil in and spray liberally around the house, particularly at potential entry points. It\u0027ll be trial and error at first but apparently should keep them at bay, make sure you dust and vacuum away any cobwebs they may be hiding in first.  Another tactic you can try is to avoid certain colours that attract the creepy crawlies. Scientists used to think that spiders don\u0027t see colour - but according to a new study it turns out that they do and their fave colour is green.

Customers can now buy the beer and taste the \u0027essence\u0027 of good looking models at various pubs after its debut on July 28 in the city of Katowice.

He said: People will try it out of curiosity, but I don\u0027t think it will be a regular addition on the table for beer lovers.

In particular, the seaside resort of Benidorm on Spain\u0027s east coast, has proved to be a popular destination for sunseekers. The hot spot, which has reached highs of 33C (91.4F) today, is a favourite for many families who seek value-for-money holidays. However many tourists may have got more than what they bargained for as scenes from the beach show it to be crammed full of holidaymakers. The sandy resort looks so overcrowded that there is barely any space on the sand for jetsetters to walk, let alone sit down and relax.  Hundreds of colourful parasols are pushed closely together along the coast, while sun seekers squeeze their way through throngs of fellow holidaymakeholidrs. Meanwhile the sea is jam packed full of people looking to cool off in the heat, with colourful floats and inflatables crowding the water. And the heatwave isn\u0027t set to cool down any time soon as a new weather model map showed an incoming 50C (122F) heat in Portugal and 48C in Spain. The furnace like heat is expected for 1.5 million Brits on Europe’s hottest day ever on Saturday.    Europe’s all-time temperature record is 48.0C, set on July 10, 1977 in Athens, Greece. Spain’s record is 47.3C, set in 2017. Portugal’s record is 47.4C, set in 2003. Meanwhile the Spanish heat will be blowing to Britain, with the 35C (95F) hottest day for three years forecast. Met Office forecaster Richard Miles said: “48C is the most realistic maximum temperature in inland Spain and Portugal, but there\u0027s a chance it could be hotter. People on holiday should be careful in the heat.

In fact, they happen way more often than most of us think - and the weirdest part is most women have no idea they were even pregnant.  New scientific research claims miscarriage is the most common outcome of becoming pregnant, detailing that most fertilised eggs result in spontaneous abortions rather than developing into healthy babies.  The paper says the majority of miscarriages happen at an early stage in pregnancy, before women even realise they have a baby growing inside them.   William Rice, evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told New Scientist : It\u0027s not an abnormality... it\u0027s the norm.  He said lots of women don\u0027t even know they\u0027re pregnant initially - and because most miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, many miscarry without even knowing it\u0027s happening. It\u0027s these unknown miscarriages that make up the majority, according to Mr Rice. In fact, he found that a woman in her 20s is just as likely to miscarry as carry the foetus to term. In the paper, he writes that miscarriage is the predominant outcome of fertilisation and a natural and inevitable part of human reproduction at all ages. Because studies show the miscarriage rate only rises with age, the number of miscarriages far outnumber live births, his analysis details.

And with the government unwilling to relent on their position of pro-gun ownership, parents have started to come up with creative ways to protect their children. Following the Sandy Hook primary school shooting in 2012, one woman devised a particularly clever way to keep kids safe.  In a post on Facebook , Katie Cornelis from Southbury revealed how she had given her two young nieces a door stop to put in their backpack.   She wrote: After the Sandy Hook shooting, I gave both my nieces this little door stop to always keep in their backpacks. It truly pained me when I handed it to them, and I didn’t want to scare them, but it was out of love and they understood. She explained that in light of the most recent shooting in the US, she wanted to share her idea with all parents and anyone that could be affected by gun violence. Katie went on to admit that she carries a doorstop in her own purse every day.  Sure it’s small, but it can be powerful in keeping you safe if you ever have to barricade yourself in a room, she said. If a gunman shoots out the door lock it will still keep the door from opening and may just buy you some time. I’m really sad posting this but a security expert shared this tip with me so I wanted to pass it on. I pray no one ever has to use it. Katie first posted the tip online in February, but it has since been shared over one million times.

Sarah Wylie, 23, was hiking up a mountain in Queensland with a man she had been hanging out with when she slipped and gouged her hand on a sharp tree branch. Luckily, some off-duty firefighters hiking the same trail came across her and lent a hand. The cut was so bad Sarah later needed surgery and a number of stitches to fix it. Her \u0027date\u0027 was then forced to abandon on Mount Tibrogargan because he was \u0027late for work\u0027 while the rescue group tended to her injury.

Brian Coulter, a member of the rescue team, told the Sunshine Coast Daily : The three firefighters with me took charge of the situation and knew exactly what needed to happen.  “She told us she was actually on a first date and that he was the one that had decided to take her up the mountain. But apparently he was running late for work so he left her there while we attended to her injuries.” Sarah was determined to remain tight-lipped about the man she said she was hanging out with insisting it was the first time they had met but admitted they are still in touch.  She told news.au : It was just two people catching up and hanging out and he’s checked up on me and made sure I’m OK.

Everybody has made me welcome at the club.“It’s been a good start for me. I’ll train hard and see how I can improve myself here, that’s the best thing I can do.“The squad is good, everybody is competitive and ready to play.“You have to push each other in training and, hopefully, it’s going to be a good season.”The 24-year-old spent the last three seasons at English non-league side Kidderminster and, after missing out on promotion to the National League, felt it was time to test himself at a higher level.When Dundee came calling shortly after the season finished, there was only one answer from the Frenchman.“I really enjoyed my time at Kidderminster, I had a good few seasons,” he added.“We missed promotion last year but I felt this summer was time for me to move on.“Obviously, Dundee came for me and I thought going to the Scottish Premiership, playing against Celtic and Rangers, would be a good level for me.“I want to step up my level as well and play against better players to improve myself and test myself.“It was the right time for me to move on.“I’ve watched a few games especially the big ones like the Celtic-Rangers ones.“I don’t know everything about the Scottish league but I think it is a good level.”As an attacking midfielder, Ngwatala has impressed many already at Dens Park with his displays in the early-season games.He, though, says there’s more to come from him – and the rest of the team – once the campaign really gets under way over the next few weeks.Shortly after signing, Ngwatala was whisked off to Portugal with the rest of the squad for a pre-season training camp and he says the good work put in on the Algarve will stand the side in good stead this season.He added: “The preparations were hard in Portugal, the weather made it difficult, but we worked very hard so, hopefully, that will help in the season.“We worked on different things and you can see we still need to get to know each other but that will come.“Sometimes it’s good to go away together because the new people like me and the ones already here stay together and learn from each other. It was good.”With a few French speakers already in the squad, it’s been easy for Ngwatala to settle into life at the Dark Blues – and he’s hoping to enjoy some good days with the fans at Dens Park, too.“Everybody is cool, you can speak to everybody, there are no problems.“It helps a lot to have some French speakers but we try to speak English so everybody can understand.“I’ve been surprised at Dens because it was a great atmosphere.“Hopefully, there’s more of that to come.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"local stalker hid phone in womans car then texted her to say he knew where she

\u0026#8211 then bombarded her with texts telling her he knew where she was.Newsome also admitted a charge of voyeurism after he snapped pictures of the woman as she dried herself after a shower.A sheriff today described his actions as “sustained, sophisticated and sinister” \u0026#8211 but Newsome avoided a jail term.Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court heard during his stalking campaign, between November 2017 and April this year, Newsome had gone through the woman\u0026#8217s phone, screenshotting private messages on it and sending them to his own device.Newsome also bombarded the woman with text messages, phone calls and messages on social media.He also threatened to disclose sensitive information to her employer and pretended to retain personal information about her.The creep then went on to conceal a mobile phone in her car and used it to track her whereabouts.Newsome then repeatedly sent her text messages telling her that he knew where she was.He further admitted that at some point between February 2017 and April this year he took a picture of the woman drying herself after coming out of the shower “for his own personal use”.Newsome, 46, of Milton Crescent, Anstruther, Fife, pleaded guilty on summary complaint to charges of stalking committed between November 2017 and April 2018 and of voyeurism committed between February 2017 and April 2018.The offences took place at

not light on talent","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHe feels his squad remains light on numbers and wants to add two or three players before the end of the transfer window in a month.But Dundee boss Neil McCann does like the options he has available to him already.Neil believes the successful Betfred Cup group campaign that’s set up a last-16 tie with Ayr United a fortnight on Saturday, has shown that.That’s the case at full-back where he believes Saturday’s crucial win over Brechin City saw his team particularly strong in that area.He was delighted with the performance of young Australian Jesse Curran, whose work since the players reported back after their summer break has left him regarded very much as a first-team player.The 22-year-old featured in all four group ties, the last two as a starter, and at the weekend was generally regarded as the Dark Blues’ best player.“I thought Jesse was excellent and pushing Cammy Kerr to left-back, I thought he was excellent out there as well,” said Neil.“Jesse was forceful and he gives us that energy on the right side, pushing forward.”The manager has the option of restoring summer signing Nathan Ralph to the line-up for this Saturday’s Premiership opener at St Mirren but the form of Curran and Kerr means it looks likely he’ll have to wait for his first top-team start.The manager still wants to add more goals, he has been pleased by the number of chances being created and the way they’ve been shared around the team.That’s something, along with assistant boss Graham Gartland, he’s been working on.“The way we are pushing our midfielders forward to be more of an attacking threat is giving teams problems.“Paul McGowan is more of an attacking threat, Kharl Madianga continues to be stronger with every game.”Meanwhile, some tickets for the trip to Paisley this weekend are available from the club shop at Dens Park.Already there’s been considerable interest in the game and Dundee have urged fans not to head west without first buying their brief.It’s been confirmed that Betfred clash with Ayr will go ahead on August 18 at 3pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united may be cautious but glass is highly rated at the club","story":"\t\t\t\t\tUntil victory at Elgin City on Saturday – however impressive, it was very much a case of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted – there is no escaping the fact Dundee United’s Betfred Cup campaign fell way below expectation.A draw and penalty shootout loss against Arbroath followed by defeat at Ross County, though the performance was decent, meant it was effectively over by the mid-point of the group stage.Going into the home clash with Alloa a week past Saturday, mathematically United could have still qualified but, as the most they could have mustered was seven points, we all knew they were out.In the previous two seasons of the group format, no runners-up had progressed with such a low total and that was to be the case again this time round as Inverness missed out on goal difference despite chalking up three wins.That meant, in some ways, another draw, that was followed by more spot-kick woe against the Wasps, was irrelevant.Except for the fact United were looking for decent performances and results in the lead up to this weekend’s Championship opener against in-form Dunfermline.It meant improvement at Borough Briggs, if nothing else to raise morale among fans, was vital.For that reason the 4-0 success up north was a big result for United and manager Csaba Laszlo who, if not quite feeling pressure, had clearly been perturbed by his new-look team’s sticky start.Csaba’s spirits were lifted by the performance and it allowed him to highlight the contribution of a young player whose displays in the Betfred had been largely lost in the gloom surrounding the first three results.In mentioning teenager Declan Glass, though, the gaffer probably demonstrated his awareness of United’s long history of producing exciting young talent. Not only did he avoid going overboard about the 18-year-old, he went out of his way not to compare him with any of those who went before him.Csaba even stressed the kid, who got his first goal at Elgin, will be developed carefully.That’s a process he started last season when there were those who felt Glass should have been thrown into the team.His boss resisted that temptation and, while we can expect to see him feature regularly in matchday squads this term, he will be used carefully.“Declan is a player from our academy and he has skill. At the moment I want to build him up and slowly give him the chance to show how good a football player he is,” said Csaba.“He has to learn a lot, especially he likes to dribble, but he has to play for the team. On Saturday – and in the previous games – he has a really good shot from the second line. He sees the situation and I think he will be a very good football player.”Even with those cautious words, it’s clear how highly United rate this kid. However much they try to protect him, the more is seen of him, the more it’s likely comparisons with other homegrown talent will be made.Given his eye for a goal and the kind of pass in and around the penalty area that creates opportunities for others, the one recent product of the Tannadice youth policy he seems most likely to be compared with is Ryan Gauld.That would come with a degree of pressure and mean he has big shoes to fill but it could be useful in his development. Talent that he is, in four years since leaving for Lisbon, Gauld hasn’t made the progress expected.That can serve as a reminder to Glass, however eager he is to develop, following his manager’s policy of taking things a step at a time looks certain to be the best way forward.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic lights out on key dundee route","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMotorists have been warned to approach with care after reports of traffic light failure on a key Dundee road.According to the BBC, the lights on Kingway West at the Myrekirk Roundabout are off for folk heading eastbound.\u0026mdash BBC Travel Scotland (@BBCTravelScot) August 2, 2018The lights are \u0026#8220unlikely to be fixed until after morning rush hour\u0026#8221, according to the alert.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/stipe.jpg ","title":"trialist dismayed as dundee decide to let him go","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA trialist has hit out after apparently failing to earn a deal at Dundee.Croatian striker Stipe Plazibat had been on trial with Neil McCann\u0026#8217s men this week in the hope of earning a deal.He featured in a bounce game against Falkirk yesterday scoring a goal and earning an assist.The Dark Blues won the game 2-0.Expressing his frustration on social media the 28-year-old wrote: \u0026#8220Goal and assist in 2:0 win in test match, and still not enough to earn contract [sic].\u0026#8220Don\u0026#8217t know what else to say. 2018 please finish, this become painful!\u0026#8221\u0026mdash Stipe Plazibat (@StipeSP44) August 1, 2018Responding to critics, he added: \u0026#8220Even manager said that he was pleased with my performance but he is looking for \u0026#8216Target Man\u0026#8217 style of player.\u0026#8221Plazibat is a free agent after being released by Bangkok Glass earlier this year.He did not play a competitive game for the side due to Thai rules meaning they could only sign five foreign players and the Bangkok side decided to terminate his deal.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"trust the club and back our team dundee united fans group tells arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA leading member of the Dundee United fans group ArabTRUST has praised the changes made at Tannadice over the summer and urged fans to get right behind the team.Stuart Campbell, who stood down as the trust’s chairman last week to concentrate on his role as an associated director with the club, believes the Tangerines are heading in the right direction.“It’s difficult to know where to start, almost every department at the club has changed over the last few months, we have a team full of new players, improved hospitality and more planned,” he said.“There has been a major change in shareholding, it really doesn’t get more radical than that.“We at ArabTRUST haven’t been immune to the need for change and, as you saw with our earlier announcement of Susan Batten taking over as chairperson, we’ve recognised that and are making the changes that will see us ready to meet the challenges that lie ahead.“ArabTRUST’s view is that we are supportive of the changes made to date but understand that change can be difficult, even painful, especially for the people directly involved and that change sometimes takes time to show the desired results.“Radical change at the club was needed, however, and overdue.“I might be going to open myself up to criticism but we all want the same thing, we want Dundee United to be successful and get promoted this season so, with that in mind, I’d urge everyone to ignore the people who seem to thrive on real or imagined negativity on or off the park.“I really believe the best chance we have of promotion this season is if as many fans as possible get behind the team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it. That can only be achieved by overhauling the current diffuse focus on individual planning applications in isolation.\"Now is the time to make that change.

A new hotel will play a key role in supporting the local economy\u0027 continued growth.\"Construction work is set to be undertaken by international firm Polcom Developments.Managing director Ross Morrow said: \"The proposed hotel, which will be branded by a well-known international hotel chain, will provide accommodation, meeting and fitness facilities for airport users, overseas visitors and local businesses.\"Polcom Developments has extensive experience in developing airport hotels, having recently been involved in the construction of a 250-bedroom hotel at Luton Airport.\"The firm also recently completed a 160-bedroom Marriott hotel on the Heriot Watt University campus, just a few miles from Edinburgh Airport.A design and access statement submitted to council planners places the hotel within the context of a wider masterplan for the development of the business park which Inverness Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stewart Nicol previously said was \"more slow burn than anybody would want\".It had secured just two tenants between 2011 and last year, before the Co-op also confirmed construction of a new distribution facility there.The site planned for the hotel is currently unoccupied but was previously used for agricultural grazing.Said to be five minutes\u0026rsquo walk from the airport, a new access road will have to be created as part of any development.Inverness economist Tony Mackay previously queried the viability of a hotel at the airport after Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) tendered for a similar development at its Inverness Campus.This week he acknowledged that the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote was continuing to fuel a tourist boom in the Highlands.\"There have been plans for a hotel at Inverness airport for many years but none of them has gone ahead yet,\" he said.\"I think that most of the hotel operators prefer locations in or close to the city centre rather than out at the airport.\"However, it seems that IABP have now found a hotel operator willing to take the risk of the airport location.\"Inverness Airport has done very well in recent years and the hotel investment and jobs should be an excellent addition to the facilities there.\"Inverness Central councillor Bet McAllister also welcomed the plans.\"I think it will be good for tourists and those from further north who need to catch a late or early flight,\" she said.Thursday 2 Aug 2018 10:34

They’ve been brilliant – so helpful and really on side.”Jonathan said the branch played a special part in their burgeoning romance.He said: “I met Joanne when she was working there as a barista while she was studying midwifery at Robert Gordon University.“We began going out in April 2016.“I used to come into the Starbucks quite a lot as I was I studying for my professional exams.“To be honest, I was completely oblivious at first – it was my friend that said she liked me.“She would often come across on her break and we got chatting.“That’s really where it all started – the early days of our relationship were in that Starbucks.”Jonathan said friends and family have been slightly bemused by their choice of venue, although they have chosen a more traditional option for their reception – the Marcliffe at Pitfodels Hotel.“The place will be shut between noon and 3pm for the wedding and they’ll be putting up fairy lights and curtains to make it look a bit nicer and like a wedding,” he said.“It’s certainly an unusual choice of wedding venue – I haven’t heard of anything like it before. Disbelief is the most common reaction we get when we tell people where we’re getting married.“The hardest people to win over were our parents who are a bit more traditional.“It took a little bit of persuasion but they’ve come around now.”As the day gets closer, the couple are completing the finishing touches for their dream wedding.Jonathan said: “The nerves are definitely kicking in.“We’re really coming down to the nitty gritty – it’s all becoming very real. But we’re both so excited for the day.”Starbucks regional manager Cindy Ross said: “We are delighted to be hosting the ceremony for Jo and Jona-than.“Jo was a barista here and that’s where she met Jonathan so it was an important place for them.“When she approached us I was over the moon.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b62a59d87279-797x564.jpg ","title":"communities make final touch ups as judges tour begins","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen is in full bloom this week as judging gets under way for a national competition.This year’s Beautiful Scotland is in full swing as the panel makes its way around the eight north-east entries this week.The competition, run in partnership with the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), aims to support community groups across the country as they seek to “improve and enhance their local environment”.While Beautiful Scotland provides the Scottish entrants to the UK-wide Britain in Bloom, as regional winners from last year Aberdeen is already a finalist for the city category.Volunteer judges will assess each entry on three attributes – horticultural achievement, environmental responsibility and community participation, along with this year’s theme of Year of the Young People.Also taking part is Aberdeen Inspired, Brighter Bucksburn, Cove in Bloom, Culter in Bloom, Powis Gardeners, Brighter Bervie and Inverurie Environmental Improvement Group.For the volunteers in Cove in Bloom, the addition of the sculpture of Isie Caie was sure to be a proud moment on the judges’ tour.Group secretary Wendy Suttar said: “We are excited to show the judges the new sculpture of Isie Caie and the community garden.“It has been a bit harder this year with the hot weather, and we have had to water the beds and planters more often.“To prepare for the visit we have just been tidying up – trimming the edges and removing the dead flowers.“We won silver gilt the previous time – our dream would be gold, it would be absolutely marvellous. The competition has really brought Cove closer together.“We just want Cove to look good and we’re pleased it looks so good to walk and drive around.”The gardens of Peterculter were also under the microscope for the Beautiful Scotland judges as they took a two-hour tour of the area with community group Culter in Bloom.Established in 2004, the volunteers took home a Silver Gilt award when it last entered the competition in 2016.Group chairman Erik Stein was keen to show the best of Culter’s new amenities for the judges’ consideration.He said: “A new feature this year will be a striking locally designed stone structure to welcome visitors approaching from Aberdeen, with a colourful display of both annual and perennial plants and shrubs.\u0026#8220We work closely with the city council in our preparations for the visit but we depend heavily on local business support for our finance and on local residents to water our displays, which has been more challenging than ever this year.“However, we have been able to invest in some new ‘self-watering’ containers which have a built-in reservoir, and we have an orchard where the judges can help themselves to strawberries.“We focus on our group motto ‘planting pride in the community’, and encouraging respect for community.”Participants in this year’s Beautiful Scotland will find out if the fruits of their labour have reaped rewards at the awards ceremony in Haddington on September 6.Brighter Bervie hosted the competition judges on Monday this week at 10am and Brighter Bucksburn will kick the weekend off with a visit on Friday at 10am.

He said: “This terrific path enabled my children and I to go on a 20km bike ride from our home in Kintore without having to pop the bikes on the car and drive to a safe cycle route.“Following its opening last Saturday and the planned next stage being Kintore to Blackburn, I am continuing my campaign for a route from Kemnay to Kintore and Inverurie.\u0026#8220Around 67% of the children who attend Kemnay Academy come from Blackburn and Kintore and are bussed there.“This route would allow them to access the school’s leisure facilities and clubs outwith school hours without parents having to taxi them.\u0026#8220I have asked council officers to look into this as the public transport links between our communities are poor and these paths not only benefit cyclists, they also provide a safe route for people to walk and jog.“The proposal has huge support within the local communities.”Mr Reid added: “This idea has been in my head since before I became a councillor.“One of my sons goes to Kemnay Academy and the bus services in that area are not very good, so it gives them limited options for using school services outside of school hours.“It makes sense to link up different Garioch communities and have a more comprehensive network rather than just focusing on the Inverurie to Aberdeen route.”Fellow East Garioch councillor Martin Ford has campaigned for a number of years for the cycle path between Kintore and Inverurie and has said he is pleased to see the route in use.Mr Ford, co-leader of Aberdeenshire Council’s Democratic Independent and Green Group, said: “The works to build the previously missing section of cycle path between Kintore and Port Elphinstone are now largely complete – including the actual path itself.\u0026#8220So the path is entirely useable all the way from Kintore to Port Elphinstone – and is being used, which is good to see.“A complete route for cyclists and pedestrians between Kintore and Port Elphinstone, without the need to cross the busy A96 dual carriageway, is obviously a big improvement.“I am very pleased Aberdeenshire Council has been able to provide this facility.”An Aberdeenshire Council spokeswoman said: “The creation of a shared-use walking and cycling path between Inverurie and Kintore is part of a larger project to develop a dedicated, traffic-free route between Inverurie and Aberdeen via Kintore and Blackburn.“In addition to this long distance route, Aberdeenshire Council is committed to improving walking and cycling infrastructure on a local level through the Integrated Travel Town projects.\u0026#8220The creation of a shared use walking and cycling path between Kintore and Kemnay is something the Council is willing to discuss with communities with a view to potentially developing in the future.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scheme to benefit children","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen university has announced its partnership with a new school.Robert Gordon University (RGU) will be working with Lochside Academy, in a bid to widen access to higher education.The scheme is part of ACCESS RGU – an initiative which sees outreach activities delivered across the north-east.

Aberdeen’s Tom Brian was just 28secs behind in second position with his clubmate Ben Ward a further 31secs behind in third.Fourth-placed Tom Roche (Insch Trail Running Club) was first Over-40 in 57:18.Kelly added: “There were four of us together for the opening two miles, then Tom Brian and myself pulled clear of the others.“We were shoulder to shoulder all the way to the top of the hill at five miles, but once we entered the off-road technical section of the course I was able to open up a bit of a lead.“When we got back on to the road for the final couple of miles I just pushed it on and managed to get the win.“I’d have to say this is probably my best performance given how hard I had to work and because I got the win over some good opponents.”Kelly believes this result will give him the confidence to go in search of more fast times in the months ahead.He said: “I have a couple of half marathons lined up and I’ll be aiming to improve on my best time of 1:15:55 set at Stirling in April.“I’m doing Nairn next month and possibly the Great Scottish Run at Glasgow in October.“I’ll be aiming to run under 1:15:00 which I think I am capable of doing based on my result at Ballater.“The Glasgow race in particular will have a high quality field so that will hopefully help push me along.“I am also thinking about doing the Leeds Abbey Dash 10km later in the year as it’s a fast course and a stacked field.“I’d also like to do some 3km and 5km races to keep my speed up and hopefully I can gain a few more podium positions.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains.

A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 31/07/18, 7:36 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

We’ll never know – but hopefully our newspaper will survive to provide some information. For an Ayrshire Post is among items going into a new time capsule at the top of the Burns Monument at Alloway. Also included in the stainless steel capsule is a Clydesdale Bank \u0026pound10 note, with a picture of Burns on it. Poignantly, there’s also a drawing of Robert Burns by National Trust for Scotland volunteer Isla Grant, 17. And there’s a letter by NTS trainee Parris Joyce on what The Bard means to her. Hopefully, the monument will survive well into the future as a result of a near \u0026pound500,000 restoration.  The old capsule turned up when workers removed the gilded urn that sits atop the monument. The urn is being regilded, and a new airtight-sealed time capsule will take the place of the old one. NTS staff suspected there might be an old capsule there.  That’s because of an old letter from a Thomas Hamilton to a John Connel (building contractor) on April 23, 1823. The letter mentions enclosing a hermetically-sealed glass bottle soldered into the tripod, and containing various items. As it happens, the Burns enthusiasts of the time chose a copper container, as the one that came out of the urn was covered in verdigris. Items inside included two Ayr newspapers of the day – an Ayr Advertiser and a West Country Journal – dating from 1816 and 1815 respectively. Although now in a poor state, these appear to have been chosen for stories they carried about proposals for a Burns Monument. The original capsule also contained a silver sixpence depicting George III. Spookily, the urn containing that capsule was erected following a parade to the then new monument on July 4, 1823. And the old capsule saw the light of day again, on July 4 this year.  The monument was built by public subscription and fundraising, and the restoration is also being funded  by donations.

The Honest Men kick off their Championship campaign at home to Partick Thistle on Saturday - the side they put to the sword last week to top their Betfred Cup group. And McCall, who is unfurling a title flag for the first time as a manager, hopes the fans can turn out for the occasion. He said: “We are all very much looking forward to the game on Saturday, where we will get the flag. “I am hoping for at least 3000 of our own fans there to make a hell of an atmosphere. “I think all the fans who missed the last game of the season will maybe want to come to this one. “Plenty would have thought we had blown the league, and they weren’t alone in thinking that - I thought we had blown it. “But we want to get off to a flyer and the fans can help.”  United will play Dundee at Dens Park in the last 16 of the Betfred League Cup on Saturday, August 18. For the second year in a row the Honest Men have topped the group with maximum points and still ended up with tough Premiership opposition away from home. McCall said: “The team that we beat in the group gets Celtic at home and we get Dundee away. “It’s just the luck of the draw. “But the way we are playing we will go up there and give it a go. McCall added: “We won the group convincingly, which was positive going into the new season.  “People seem to forget that it’s the second biggest cup in Scotland. “For a club like us to be a seeded team two years in a row is just exceptional. “I think our fans have bought into it too, as there was over 700 fans there at Firhill which was amazing.” Lawrence Shankland scored a stunning 35 yard lob to make it 37 goals from 37 games. McCall said: “He is very happy here so I think it would take a hell of an offer for him to leave.” Ross Docherty, who was on the bench against Partick, is expected to be in the squad on Saturay. Mark Kerr will be suspended due to bookings from last season carrying over. Chris Higgins is still sidelined, and Craig Moore and Andy Geggan will be assessed closer to game time.

Much the same reaction as when food is about and the hungry gulls swoop. South Ayrshire Council has just introduced tough metal bins in Ayr High Street that gulls cannot peck rubbish and scraps out.

They easily got into the half-open unit — then smashed their way into the Currys PC World store right next door. But the hundreds of thousands of pounds of electrical stock inside remained intact. The daring thieves smashed down a fire door to get into the stockroom — but all the expensive items were locked inside metal cages. And they did not get access to the showroom at the front. Store staff called in police at opening time on Saturday after discovering the mess they made. One source said: “This was an audacious attempt to clean the place out of valuable goods including computers, TVs and kitchen goods. “But they got absolutely nothing.” The raid happened in the early hours of Sunday, with the raiders exploiting the empty store next door. It used to be part of the electrical and computing chain, but is being turned into the 24-hour, no-frills PureGym. But access is simply over a seven foot high metal fence. The source added: “There were no extra security measures and no alarms, it was easy to get in and most of the entrance was open to the four winds. “The gang used hammers and cutting gear to batter down a fire exit door.

Workers had to resort to giving out more expensive bag-for-life style carriers in a bid to appease grocery laden shoppers. The store is said to be among the most profitable Morrisons supermarkets in Scotland. But one staff member said: “This is the third time this month they’ve forgotten to order in the 10p bags - it’s unbelievable. And it had to happen on what seems like one of the busiest days of the year. “There are other Morrisons in Troon and Kilmarnock, you would think they could get an emergency supply from them, but apparently not.” The bustling store in the town’s Castlehill Road stopped selling 5p bags in a bid to go green and re-use the stronger 10p bags. A Morrisons spokeswoman said: “Due to a higher than normal demand one day this week, our Ayr store ran out of 10p bags. They have received a delivery since.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSupermarketsAyrKilmarnockTroonAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"teen golfer cards course record","story":"NewsTeen golfer cards course record and gets hole-in-oneHe scored just 61 ... a Tiger-beating eight under par.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston14:44, 1 AUG 2018NewsHe\u0027s number one Glenn Wilson of Dalmilling golf club (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA 15-year-old boy has equalled the golf course record at his club ... carding a hole-in-one along the way. Dalmilling Golf Club in Ayr is now planning to honour Glenn Wilson’s awesome achievement. He scored just 61 ... a Tiger-beating eight under par. That equalled Sean Ryan’s round seven years ago and Glenn said: “I thought I was playing well, but not this well. “I love golf and cannot get enough of it.” He bagged an ace during the July Saturday Bowl at the lucky-for-him 13th. Yet at the second hole he scored a potentially card-wrecking double bogey 6. Glenn said: “My drive at the second landed in a divot and I ended up catching it thin and going into the bushes at the back.” He got hooked on golf six years ago when he picked up an old club and started hitting balls in the field near his home in Dalmilling. Three years ago he joined Dalmilling as a member and has played most days since then. His handicap has gradually gone down from 19 to the present six. That meant his score in the July Bowl was a net 55, blowing any opposition out of the water. His inward nine was just 28 strikes. Club secretary Tommy Swan says everyone is very proud of their “superstar.” He added: “This is an outstanding achievement, a magnificent score for a 15-year-old. “I’d say it was even more special because he double-bogied the second hole. “That would have wrecked most players, but Glenn stuck at it. “He started out at Dalmilling with only a few clubs, but has gradually built a set. And he is so keen on the game that he also volunteers to help the green-keeping staff on a regular basis. “We are planning something in his honour.” Glenn, of Thorneyflat Street, is in his fourth year at Ayr Academy and is cheered on by his three sisters and one brother. Parents Linda and Glenn are suitably proud of their starlet.  He is keen to make golf  his living and already represents his club in Ayrshire Golf Association competitions.  The next step would be to try for the Ayrshire Boys team. At the moment he is volunteering with the greenkeeping staff as part of his Duke of Edinburgh bronze award. And he casually admits that the hole in one was not his first, but his THIRD.  Most golfers don’t get one in their entire playing days and Glenn said: “I play  every day and I love Dalmilling.   “This was my first hole  in one during a competition.  “But I have just had two others, both at the eighth at Dalmilling, with my pal Adam Cambers and my uncle John Strachan.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsEdinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"ben-saddles-up-to-cycle-coast-to-coast-in-one-day","story":"A PEEBLES man is saddling up this weekend to cycle coast-to-coast across Scotland in a day.\nBen Glasgow will join riders from Edinburgh and South Ayrshire in a charity cycle ride from Prestwick, on the west coast to Berwick.\nThe 37-year-old, who aims to complete his 140-mile journey on Saturday, will travel through Ayrshire, Lanarkshire, Peeblesshire and across the Borders.\nThe ride will set off at 6am, and aims to pass through Peebles\u0026rsquo Tweed Green between 1.15pm and 1.30pm.\nThe epic event aims to raise money for three causes \u0026ndash blood cancer charity DKMS Alzheimer Scotland and Cash for Kids.\nThe former Peebles and Edinburgh Northern \u0026lsquoGents\u0026rsquo (over 35s) rugby player started cycling in 2015 after a knee injury put a halt to his regular appearances on the pitch.\nAnd Ben, who works for the Scottish Government, is calling on Peebleans to show their support on Saturday and get involved, as he takes on his longest-ever bike ride.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoAdding another 50 per cent on to the longest ride I\u0026rsquove ever done in one day will be quite a challenge.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not exactly of an aerodynamic build, and the route we\u0026rsquore taking across the width of Scotland features some pretty testing terrain to climb up and over on the best of days for bigger units like me \u0026ndash let alone if the weather conditions and wind decide to conspire against us.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom looking forward to it though, and continuing to raise much-needed funds for a variety of great charitable causes.

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town.

faced a real pre-season test against the well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top quality opposition to Kintyre Park in the shape of Bridgewater, last season’s Scottish amateur cup semi- finalists.A tough match is in the offing, as Bridgewater  lost narrowly by 1-0 to the brilliant

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

Eileen, 31, will return to the country where she was born as part of a team including Mercury-nominated artist, producer and collaborator Jon Hopkins and neuroscientist Mendel Kaelen, as well as photographers, architects and filmmakers.  Eileen said: \u0026ldquoAfter a 10-year solo adventure into the depths of the Legend of Tayos and my father\u0026rsquos work, it is a real honour to be joined in this quest to protect the caves by such an inspiring group of fellow explorers with a collective knowledge and talent beyond anything I could have imagined was possible.  \u0026ldquoI am excited to be part of the efforts to continue what my father and Neil Armstrong started back in the 1970s and have renewed hope in the efforts of protecting these precious, beautiful and fragile environments from devastating destruction.  The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020. It is hoped the exhibition will shine a light on a drive to make Cueva de los Tayos\u0026rsquo unique and endangered ecosystem a UNESCO World Heritage site.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.

Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

Scots who incurred expenses claimed, on average, \u0026pound994.77 in the last year, and the smallest amount they would claim for is \u0026pound8.43, according to new research.  At the top of the list of reasons of Brits who failed to file expenses included deeming the value \u0026ldquotoo low to be worth the hassle and losing receipts.  Half of those who incurred business costs were frustrated at having to pay for them using their own funds before being reimbursed by their company.  More than a third experienced cash flow issues while waiting for their expense claims to be reconciled, with almost one in ten even missing a payment on a personal credit card as a result.  Visiting in-laws, ironing and cleaning the house were all activities workers would rather do than submit their expenses, the team at Barclaycard found.  Personal finance expert, Annie Shaw, described the findings as \u0026ldquoeye-opening.  She added: \u0026ldquoWith some resorting to paying out of their own pocket to cover company costs, it\u0026rsquos clear action needs to be taken to prevent employees footing the bill.

Andrew Chapman, Director of Sales \u0026amp Marketing at Keith Brewery Ltd, said \u0026ldquoWith the two breweries only five miles apart, the merger seems an obvious solution to reduce the duplication of costs across various departments in both businesses.  \"There were a lot of synergies across both companies and it is hoped that both breweries can provide missing pieces of the puzzle to each other, such as staffing, bottling and\u0026nbspkegging facilities, storage and logistics.  David MacDonald, Founder of Spey Valley Brewery, added \u0026ldquoThere has been a great relationship between the two breweries for many years and this move formalises that. It allows both to take advantage of cross selling opportunities with our existing customers and gives us time to work on developing new business that would have been difficult to achieve working independently.  It will also allow the brewers at both premises to share knowledge, information and best practise techniques, which is essential when producing the best beer possible.    The merger follows on from the success of both breweries in 2017, with Keith Brewery Ltd\u0026rsquos coffee stout (Stout Keith, 5% ABV) becoming the only Scottish beer to receive the maximum 3* from The Great Taste Guide and Spey Valley\u0026rsquos bitter ale (David\u0026rsquos Not So Bitter, 4.4% ABV) winning Best British Style Beer at the Scottish Beer Awards.

This prompted a joke, suggesting that the only remedy would be to set up a brewery. This must be the solution, right?  Three years later, in 1995, we brewed our first ales \u0026ndash Red Cuillin and Black Cuillin. We always knew that these were to be our first two ales - named after the two mountain ranges on the island. They were such a success, we still brew them to the same recipes today. The only difference? The names have changed \u0026ndash we now call them Skye Red and Skye Black.    The choice of names behind our beers are laden with meanings. For instance, the name of our Young Pretender beer was decided upon for its historic associations. Firstly, and most obviously, it was first brewed in 1995, which was the 250th anniversary of the 1745 rebellion. This was the rebellion in which Bonnie Prince Charlie (known as The Young Pretender) attempted to gain the British crown. It was Bonnie Prince Charlie\u0026rsquos historic association with Skye which led us to create our Young Pretender beer.    Our Young Pretender ale has went on to win numerous awards \u0026ndash \u0026lsquoChampion Bitter of Scotland 2016\u0026rsquo and finalist at Great British Beer Festival 2017. However, don\u0026rsquot be fooled, it\u0026rsquos not just Young Pretender winning all the awards. In 1997, way back when, we won the CAMRA (Campaign for Real Ale) Champion Beer of Scotland and we were shortlisted for the UK championship too.

It praised Transport Scotland\u0027s budgeting, governance, quality assurance, risk management and competitive tendering for the crossing, finding the Scottish Government agency had managed the project well, with \"a clear project scope and the budget included all relevant costs\".  The report stated: \"The team provided regular, consistent and up-to-date information to the project board about costs, risks, quality and timescales.  \"This provided a strong foundation for the project to succeed.\"  However, the auditor also noted it was too early for some of the new bridge\u0027s wider benefits - such as improving public transport across the Forth, cutting journey times and boosting the economy - to be demonstrated.  Transport Scotland has a plan for evaluating progress, including the impact on journey times and traffic flow.  However, the report said \"more detail is required on other outcome measures and when these will be delivered\".  \"For example, how it will assess the impact of improved network connections and junctions, and the project\u0027s contribution to economic growth,\" it added.  Further detail is also needed on public transport benefits, the report said.  \"Transport Scotland now needs to clearly set out its plans on how it will support public transport providers to meet increasing demand for travel across the Forth. This should include actions and timescales.\"  Auditor General Caroline Gardner said: \"There is much the public sector can learn from the way Transport Scotland managed the project and it\u0027s important that the good practice is shared more widely.  \"The management of the project delivered value for money and achieved its overall aim of maintaining a reliable road link between Fife and the Lothians.  \"Transport Scotland now needs to produce a clearer plan about how it will measure the success of the project\u0027s wider benefits, including its contribution to economic growth and improved public transport links.\"  Transport Secretary Michael Matheson welcomed the report\u0027s findings.  He said: \"While it is too early to complete a wide-ranging assessment evaluating the project\u0027s outcomes, we accept the recommendations in the report and aim to carry out a full post-project evaluation in late 2018 detailing performance relating to journey times and traffic flows.  \"This will include an assessment of the impact of improved network connections and junctions, and the project\u0027s contribution to economic growth and exploring what further support can be offered to public transport providers to meet any future increase in demand for travel across the Forth.\"  He added: \"As recommended in the report, the successful delivery of the Forth Replacement Crossing project has provided a number of valuable lessons learned that we utilise in our future work and we will seek opportunities to share these lessons more broadly within the Scottish Government and the broader public sector.\"  The Scottish Greens said that the party would \"continue to press the government to provide our country with a first-class public transport system\".  John Finnie MSP, the Scottish Greens\u0026rsquo transport spokesman, said: \"Before ministers applaud themselves for the report\u0026rsquos findings, they\u0026rsquod do well to remember that Audit Scotland states it\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotoo soon\u0026rsquo to determine if public transport has been improved as a result of the bridge opening.\""},{"url":null,"title":"humanist-society-overtakes-kirk-in-wedding-stakes","story":"  The Humanist Society Scotland overtook the Church of Scotland for the first time last year, conducting 3280 marriages, despite humanist weddings only becoming legal in 2005.  The Society\u0026rsquos celebrants leapfrogged the Kirk\u0026rsquos ministers thanks to an eight per cent increase in ceremonies in 2017, compared to a 14 per cent fall in the Church\u0026rsquos marriages.  The figures were released by the National Records of Scotland as part of their annual round up demographic trends in Scotland.  The statistics confirmed a long-term collapse in religious services in Scotland, with exactly half of the 28,440 marriages last year being civil ceremonies.  In 1975, the Kirk conducted 16,849 marriages, the largest number by any organisation, and more than the 13,906 civil ceremonies that year.  However last year, Church of Scotland marriages were down to 3166, compared to the Humanist Society Scotland\u0026rsquos 3283.  There were 1182 Roman Catholic marriages last year, compared to 6,002 in 1975.  Although humanist weddings of all varieties have eclipsed religious weddings for several years, 2017 was the first with the HSS as the biggest single provider.  Former Socialist MSP and convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan recently announced he is training to be a humanist celebrant.  Lynsey Kidd, HSS director of services, said: \"These latest statistics are a major vote of confidence in the charity\u0027s meaningful and personal ceremonies.  \u0026ldquoWe know from couples that it is very important to them to have a ceremony which reflects, and is delivered by someone who shares their beliefs and values.  \u0026ldquoHumanist Society Scotland are now the number one provider of marriage ceremonies, more than any religious group or other belief body.  \"These numbers also reflect a wider trend of a decline in religious identity within the Scottish population. While it is important to recognise that faith plays an important part in a significant number of people\u0027s lives, Scotland has become a nation where it is now the the norm, not the exception, to have a non-religious Humanist approach to life.\"  Rev Norman Smith, convener of the Mission and Discipleship Council of the Church of Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoAlong with our sister churches, the majority of religious or belief\u0026ndashbased marriages in Scotland today continue to be from the Christian faith.  \u0026ldquoWhilst the rise of secularism means that fewer people may choose a religious ceremony, many people still find it meaningful to acknowledge the place of faith in their lives at such an important occasion.  \u0026ldquoWe would encourage anyone considering marriage to approach their local parish minister when thinking about their very special day."},{"url":null,"title":"school-tests-for-five-year-olds-leave-pupils-shaking-and-crying","story":"  The call came after new evidence emerged of P1 pupils \"shaking and crying\" as they took the new literacy and numeracy assessments - which can last up to 40 minutes.  Teacher feedback to the Scottish Government released under freedom of information legislation has highlighted a raft of other concerns including lack of suitable IT equipment and significant loss of teaching time. Parents have also contacted the government to establish whether they can opt out.  One teacher said: \"The fact young children are having to spend hours sat in front of a screen completing these assessments is wrong and goes against all that we know about appropriate learning.  \"Trust teachers to observe and assess children in developmentally appropriate ways rather than endless, meaningless assessments in front of a screen.\"  One senior school manager said: \"My team felt the P1 test was far too difficult, not only in terms of the level of digital literacy required - one pupil actually lifted the mouse in the air like an aeroplane to try and make it work - but also for the way the questions were worded and their level of difficulty.  \"We had one child with additional support needs who triggered severe distressed behaviour as he couldn\u0027t be helped to answer the questions and another P1 who just clicked anything.\"  A headteacher said: \"I feel I have betrayed relationships and harmed them with our children, particularly our most vulnerable, by putting them through these tests.  \"They are completely inappropriate and have left even those children who are flying and are ahead of where we would expect, upset and worried.  \"Less common, but still far more frequent than is at all acceptable, are children who display extreme signs of distress, shaking and crying. Where this happens we stop the test, but by then the damage is already done.\"  Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who submitted the freedom of information request, called on the tests for five-year-olds to be scrapped.  He said: \"Hundreds upon hundreds of complaints now show the chaos ministers inflicted on their classrooms last year, at the expense of tens of thousands of children.  \"The feedback from teachers from every corner of Scotland is brutal. Testing P1s was clearly soul destroying and countless teachers report their classes and learning grinding to a halt for weeks.  \"Teachers have told ministers of their heartbreak at putting their pupils through something which they can see is harming their progress and causing distress. Making those starting P1 this month do the tests cannot be justified.\"  In May, John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said he was \"very sensitive\" to concerns about P1 assessments and acknowledged the wider debate, but said the assessments were important to judge progress on closing the attainment gap.  A Scottish Government spokesman said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoAssessment is part of everyday learning and teaching.  \"Standardised assessments provide information to help teachers to check progress in early maths, literacy, development and behaviour, and identify where further support may be required.\"  The spokesman said a review of the first year of the assessments, to be published in August, would set out changes to the system for next year.  He added: \"We will continue to listen to the views of teachers and take the action necessary to improve standards in our schools and to close the attainment gap.  The feedback comes after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments for all pupils in P1, P4, P7 and S3 as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  There has also been positive feedback on the tests, with one teacher of 17 years\u0026rsquo experience saying: \u0026ldquoPupils ... all enjoyed doing them. There was no stress involved as it was not built up into anything high stakes beforehand.  \u0026ldquoI love to see them so engaged and trying their best. I also find the information invaluable to my teaching and the pupils\u0026rsquo learning.  Another said: \u0026ldquoMost children found it quite enjoyable.

Mr Hunt made the claim in Vienna alongside his Austrian counterpart Karin Kneissl.  However Ms Kneissl, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, downplayed the prospect of the UK and Europe failing to reach a deal on trade and customs by March 2019.  \u0026ldquoFrom the [European] commission\u0026rsquos side there is a clear-cut schedule, so an accident is not really something people are working for, she said, calling her talks with Mr Hunt \u0026ldquoexcellent.  But Mr Hunt was adamant the UK would not blink in negotiations, despite Europe saying parts of the Chequers plan are unworkable and a potential smugglers\u0026rsquo charters.  The UK\u0026rsquos proposal would maintain a \u0026ldquocommon rule book on goods and agri-foods, but avoid current restrictions on services and migration, something the EU regards as cherry-picking.  Mr Hunt said: \u0026ldquoWe have to make a decision on Britain\u0026rsquos future relationship with the EU by the end of this year and we have to be very honest with ourselves about the choices that we face. At the moment we are heading for no deal by accident.  Despite Theresa May insisting a no-deal Brexit would be better than a bad deal, Mr Hunt said a no-deal legal and regulatory cliff edge would be a \u0026ldquohuge geo-strategic mistake with \u0026ldquoa profound impact on the relations between Britain and EU countries for a generation.  His comments coincided with Sky News revealing dozens of internal council plans to cope with a no-deal, including preparing for the possibility of social unrest.  Dover District Council and Kent County Council are preparing for a 13-mile lorry park on the M20 southbound for at least four years to cope with tailbacks at ports.  Pembrokeshire is concerned about food supplies, East Sussex fears care staff would quit the country, while Bristol says its top-line threat is \u0026ldquosocial unrest or disillusionment.  One of the most common complaints among councils was a lack of direction from Whitehall.  Kevin Bentley, chair of the Local Government Association Brexit Taskforce, said leaving the EU would have a \"significant impact\" on councils.  The Government said it was \u0026ldquoconfident we will secure a positive agreement with the EU, but was working closely with councils to plan for all scenarios.  Theresa May, who interrupts her holiday tomorrow to visit France\u0026rsquos President Macron to push the Chequers plan, will have to make \"significant\" concessions to get a deal, a respected thinktank said.  The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said the PM would have to pay more cash to the EU and accept higher migration, and warned an \u0026ldquoepidemic of uncertainty was already affecting the nation and its economy.  It said a no deal Brexit would end up costing the UK economy \u0026pound800 per person per year in lost output, while even the softer Chequers plan would cost \u0026pound500 per head.  SNP MP Peter Grant MP said the warning had \u0026ldquofallen on deaf ears in Theresa May\u0026rsquos cabinet.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe comments from the Foreign Secretary that the likelihood of a no-deal is increasing by the day, and that the UK government will not blink in its negotiations with the EU, are unbefitting of the office he holds.

Think Love Island with hip replacements.  Bravo to whoever had the idea of casting the Scots double act alongside the usual crew of retired actors and sports people.  Pure dead Glaswegian to their core, it is touch and go whether India will survive cultural contact with them.  Stanley and The Krankies managed to find an off-licence and filled their boots.  Expensive, said Janette (Wee Jimmy Krankie) when they emerged.  \u0026ldquoWell you can\u0026rsquot get a bottle of wine for \u0026pound8 in England now! spluttered Stanley, or Stan, as Ian Tough (Mr Krankie) called him.  \u0026ldquoYou can when you go to Lidl or Aldi, said Janette.  Stanley looked at her in puzzlement, perhaps wondering if she was referring to parts of the Loire he had yet to discover.  The programme\u0026rsquos ostensible aim was to find out if India\u0026rsquos weather and low cost of living made it a possible retirement spot, as in the movie The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.  Everyone certainly adored the luxury hotel the Beeb had booked.  The trouble started when they left it.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a bit grubby, isn\u0026rsquot it? said actor Stephanie Beacham.  Janette was in tears at the sight of a donkey carrying a load of bricks. She clung to her husband as scooters roared past.  \u0026ldquoJanette went from crying to laughing to being terrified, Ian told the others.  Now she knows what it feels like to watch your stage act, someone might have muttered, but no one was that mean.  This being the first week everyone was on their best behaviour.  Later, comic Syd Little and Ian took pity on jockey Bob Champion, who had never eaten a curry before, and decided to cook a roast chicken dinner.  This meant shopping for chickens.  Real, live ones.  The butcher duly plucked one from a cage and hacked its head off.  Poor Syd nearly fainted.  Bob enjoyed the dinner, which was more than the chicken did.  There is a month of this to go.

The new building will provide a bigger stage for the Society\u0027s work, a year-round \"functional space\" for education, visiting media workrooms, cultural workshops, its AGM and even rehearsal space for visiting Fringe companies.  The new headquarters would be a new and more noticeable visual presence in the city\u0027s urban landscape, but the chief executive of the Fringe hopes to avoid using an A-listed or ancient building for the HQ.  The establishment of the \u0027Fringe Home\u0027 is part of a series of projects to be boosted by a new \u0026pound100,000 grant from the UK Government.  The Society has begun looking at property in the city belonging to the City of Edinburgh Council and the University of Edinburgh, while available private buildings are also due to be assessed.  Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the festival, is frustrated that the Fringe - the largest arts festival in the world - has to be run from three, sometimes cramped, separate offices off the Royal Mile, with no space for large events or meetings.  The Fringe uses a University building, Appleton Tower, for its media and events base, Fringe Central, but is now looking for a building to provide a public face to the visiting world, as well as an all-year round head quarters.  Ms McCarthy said ideally the head quarters would be a functional space like Rockvilla, the new home of the National Theatre of Scotland in Glasgow, rather than an A-listed heritage building.  The Society would keep its well known shop on the Royal Mile, but it would become completely dedicated to retail and box office space.  It owns its other two premises, the sale of which would fund the new HQ.  Ms McCarthy said the Society had already opened talks with asset managers of the City of Edinburgh Council, and the asset managers of the University of Edinburgh.  She said: \"It makes sense on so many levels, we are a small team and we are split over three separate buildings.  \"We work so collaboratively - we have operations, marketing and participation services - but within that there are teams working in all parts, so it is frustrating for us to be in three places.\"  She added: \"We are realistic to know that this is a city where buildings are at a premium, and it has to be the right thing.  \"It has to feel \u0027Fringe\u0027, we are not looking for some precious listed building, we are looking for something functional and workable that people feel welcome when they come into it.\"  Last night the UK Government announced \u0026pound100,000 in funding for the Fringe.  The funding will be used to pay for a \"streamlined accreditation and ticket request system, develop the Edfringe website, and help create an Arts Industry app\" as well proving some money for the project to develeop the new headquarters.  Jeremy Wright, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: \"The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is an annual showcase of creativity and a global marketplace for emerging talent.  \"It has launched the careers of some of the UK\u0026rsquos finest writers and performers and we want to ensure it continues to go from strength to strength, helping to break new acts here and across the globe.  \"This funding will help the Fringe increase its digital capability, making it even easier for visitors to this world-class event to enjoy everything it has to offer.\""},{"url":null,"title":"drinking-water-quality-in-scotland-remains-high","story":"  The Drinking Water Quality Regulator for Scotland\u0027s latest report shows Scottish Water\u0027s compliance with drinking water standards was 99.91% for 2017, the same as for the two previous years.

It says the boxes can be a \"positive significant investment\" in early years, and may contribute to reducing inequality.  Baby boxes were made available to all expectant mothers in Scotland from August last year.  In England, some NHS trusts have introduced pilot schemes or full baby box schemes over the last two years.  Wales and Northern Ireland do not have any such schemes.  The boxes, which contain essential items for newborns, are also promoted as a safe place for babies to sleep.  The RCM said provision of the boxes is likely to reduce the risks associated with unsafe co-sleeping, particularly in more deprived communities.  Co-sleeping has been identified as a key risk factor for cot death or sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI).  The organisation also acknowledged there is \"limited evidence\" around baby boxes reducing deaths from SUDI.  Earlier this year cot death expert Dr Peter Blair raised concerns about the promotion of the boxes for sleeping.  Dr Blair, chairman of the International Society for the Study and Prevention of Perinatal and Infant Death, told  newspaper: \"They shouldn\u0027t be advocating infants sleep in these boxes unless there isn\u0027t anything else available.\"  The Scottish Government said its baby box conforms to all relevant safety standards currently in place for a crib or cradle.  The British Standards Institution (BSI) is considering developing a standard specifically for baby boxes.  Gill Walton, of the Royal College of Midwives, said: \"A baby box is a positive gift which signals that every baby is important and welcomed.  \"Providing them will help many families whatever their background, and provide a more equal start to life for the baby.  \"The Scottish baby box contains a number of very useful baby items that can support the health and wellbeing of new babies, including an electronic thermometer, a baby carrying sling, a bath thermometer and a range of clothing.  \"Most importantly by enabling parents to give their babies a safe sleeping space, baby boxes may reduce unsafe co-sleeping or babies sleeping in an inappropriate place such as a sofa.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lottery-winners-revealed-how-couple-scooped-58m-with-a-torn-ticket","story":"  But a message on a lottery terminal in Fred and Lesley Higgins\u0026rsquos local Aberdeenshire shop told them to keep hold of the ripped ticket and call operator Camelot.

He ripped the ticket in two and threw it into the bin, as they would with all non-winning tickets.  \u0026ldquoBut this time, the terminal produced a chitty which said I needed to retain my ticket and call Camelot.

The\u0026nbsp BBC said it had asked YouTube to also allow the 13 videos to be reinstated to the Wings Over Scotland channel.  BBC Scotland\u0027s head of public policy, Ian Small, said the move came after discussions with \"colleagues in London and elsewhere in the BBC\".    Former First Minister Alex Salmond had criticised the BBC for \u0026ldquorotten conduct amid the crackdown.

Mr Campbell says he was not given the opportunity to similarly \u0027lock down\u0027 his contested clips and save his channel.  But Mr Campbell has highlighted political channels hosted by the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Conservatives and UKIP among others which publicly display BBC content.    Mr Campbell has contested the removal of the videos with YouTube citing fair dealing for all of them, \"since all are just short extracts and all of them explicitly identify the original source\".  \"Fair dealing\" exemptions in copyright law, allow material to be used for the purposes of \"criticism, review and reporting current events\" but only allow a \"reasonable and necessary\" amount of someone else\u0027s work to be used.

The bench, which would have been used by many a passenger at the old station before its closure in 1964, was recently discovered at auction and has now been secured for the project by Aberdeenshire Council and regional transport partnership Nestrans.                                                    It is hoped that following its refurbishment the bench will form part of the new station, providing a tangible link to the station’s history which was a strong theme from earlier consultation with the community.                                                    The project team are also keen to involve local organisations in the restoration work, with support already provided by haulage firm ARR Craib who assisted with transport of the bench.        The news comes soon after plans for the wider Kintore Rail Station project took a significant step forward with planning permission now granted for the platform, car park and access road. Councillor Peter Argyle, who is chair of Nestrans, deputy leader of Aberdeenshire Council and chair of their Infrastructure Services Committee, said: “I am very pleased to see the progress that has been made on the development of the station. “The discovery of the bench is most opportune and a fantastic way to involve the community and recognise their desire to see local history reflected in the new development. I look forward to seeing the bench renovated and on site at the new station.”Councillor Martin Ford, who is a member of the Garioch Area Committee and a substitute member for the Nestrans board, had highlighted the historical find at auction and added: “I am delighted that the bench has been secured and will form a point of historical interest at the new station.                                                                                                         “The area where the new station is sited has deep historical roots in transportation, going back prior to the 1800s, and you can see various signs and markers of its time as a Turnpike Road and a canal route. Whilst we do not know the exact age of the bench, it seems fitting that we can continue this tradition and link the new station back to the former site, which opened in the 1850s.” The station project is jointly funded by Aberdeenshire Council, Nestrans, and Transport Scotland via the Scottish Stations Fund, with support from Network Rail and ScotRail.

Some Freeview channels are moving to new airwaves to allow for the future development of new mobile broadband services.1 Following a decision by the UK Government, transmitters are being updated region by region as part of a major engineering programme being carried out between now and 2020.

On both dates, engineering work will begin shortly after midnight and some Freeview channels will be off-air overnight until 6am. After this, any viewers receiving their TV signal from the main Durris transmitter who find they are missing channels can retune. Services from smaller local transmitters may be subject to disruption until late afternoon. Satellite and cable TV are not affected.        Around 220,000 homes are served by the affected transmitters. Freeview will be running an information campaign to prepare people for the change, including advertising and on-screen messages.Retuning should be straightforward and some TV equipment will retune automatically.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Thursday 2 Aug 2018 10:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Thursday 2 Aug 2018 10:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Thursday 2 Aug 2018 10:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Thursday 2 Aug 2018 10:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The additional activity generated will create high-skilled jobs and encourage foreign direct investment.\"The Sutherland site could be operational by the early 2020s, creating hundreds of jobs through the use of innovative rocket technology to delver a cost-effective launch service.The UK Space Agency selected Sutherland because Scotland is the best place in the UK to reach highly sought-after satellite orbits with vertically-launched rockets.Thursday 2 Aug 2018 10:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16?

And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"115 north road lerwick 2 ","story":"OFFERS OVER £320,000\nEnjoying a commanding position and having the living area on the first floor affords this 2 storey house stunning panoramic sea views over Lerwick Harbour.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nThursday 2 Aug 2018 10:37 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sleat-and-Strath.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix. It is a region which he enjoys and which he hopes to visit again.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kerri ann in limbo as she faces long wait","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA YOUNG\n Newtownabbey woman who suffers from suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) has said that “nothing in her future is certain” as she faces a possible two-year wait for treatment.\n\n24-year-old Kerri Ann Flanagan had suffered from bouts of paralysis and pain for around five years before optic neurosis claimed the sight in one of her eyes in April.\n\nAfter years of misdiagnosis, Kerri Ann was eventually referred to a neurologist and an MRI scan showed a number of symptoms linked to MS.\n\nThe MRI uncovered 10 lesions on Kerri Ann’s brain and instances of demyelination – where the cover on the nerve cells on the brain is worn away, leaving them exposed to further damage.\n\nDespite the severity of her condition, Kerri Ann could be faced with a two-year wait for treatment, and she said she’s  “absolutely terrified”.\n\n“That worry and that fear has caused me so much extra stress and anxiety,” she said. \n\n“The waiting lists are adding pressure to people who are already dealing with so much. I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup tries to block northern ireland council flying pride flag","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive. That\u0027s where we\u0027re at as things stand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, Barnardo\u0027s has become the first children\u0027s charity in Northern Ireland to publicly voice support for the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nIt made the announcement to coincide with Belfast Pride\u0027s Coming Out for Change campaign, and just days before the city\u0027s Pride parade.\n\nBarnardo\u0027s has in the past supported marriage equality campaigns in other areas of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe director of Barnardo\u0027s NI Lynda Wilson said it hoped to see marriage equality extended to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We are committed to providing equality of opportunity and believe marriage equality is an extension of that,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"parliament website lists ian paisley as independent","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"union jack a flag of convenience for parts of dup leadership says lord adonis","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

[]).push({})\n\n\nSome 691 Lottery millionaires live in the South East, just ahead of the Midlands with 687, according to Camelot statistics on where winners lived when they made their claim.\n\nThe bad news for would-be millionaires in Northern Ireland is that it is the region of the UK with the least winners. \n\nThe province sits at the bottom of the table with 117 winners of £1 million or more and 748 of £500,000 or more.\n\nThis no doubt may have something to do with the population of Northern Ireland being much smaller than other regions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nThe Midlands just edges out the South East as the home of winners of £50,000 or more – at 5,705 ahead of the South East’s 5,221.\n\nScotland is still home to the largest lottery win claimed in the UK – £161 million, won in 2011 by Colin and Chris Weir from Largs in North Ayrshire – and to 472 other winners of £1 million or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin and Chris Weir celebrating in 2011(Lynne Cameron/PA)\n\n\n\n\nNow it adds Fred and Lesley Higgins, from Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, who have scooped a EuroMillions win of £57,975,367 from the draw on July 10.\n\nLondon is home to 611 winners of £1 million or more, followed by the North West with 595.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFred and Lesley Higgins have won more than £57m (Andrew Milligan/PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe postcodes where players are most likely to win a major National Lottery prize, according to statistics most recently updated in May last year, are Cleveland (TS) and Romford (RM), closely followed by Warrington (WA), Liverpool (L), Newport (NP) and Newcastle (NE).\n\nThe postcodes are ranked by the number of major prizes of £50,000 or more won per head of adult population since the National Lottery began.\n\nThe TS postcode, which includes Middlesbrough, Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees, has more winners per head than anywhere else in the country.\n\nThe statistics, which include both publicity and non-publicity winners, reveal the top 10 postcodes are:\n\nTS – Cleveland\nRM – Romford\nWA – Warrington\nL – Liverpool\nNP – Newport\nNE – Newcastle Upon Tyne\nME – Medway\nSR – Sunderland\nWN – Wigan\nBR –
