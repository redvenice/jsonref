He branded the revamp \u0027completely and utterly insane\u0027          A major revamp of the BBC children\u0027s show is underway, in an attempt to revise the series for a modern, politically correct era. But it has received criticism from the son of the show\u0027s creator         The Wombles were originally created in a series of children\u0027s novels from 1968. They appeared in a highly successful TV show (pictured) in the UK in the 1970sIt follows Mr Robertson, 64, telling The Mail on Sunday: \u0027It\u0027s a fight for the soul of the Wombles, I feel we\u0027re being held hostage. \u0027We\u0027ve never owned all the rights, but we\u0027ve always had respect for the idea that the Wombles came from my mother\u0027s head. Now that\u0027s all gone.\u0027He added: \u0027As far as the family is concerned, it should be a very simple story for children to enjoy, with no hidden messages other than the one that has always been there - about looking after their surroundings. Wombles are not humans.

It\u0027s going to get a lot worse, very quickly.This morning, Trump went on an angry defensive self-congratulatory tweet-storm, boasting about how well he is handling the crisis, and attacking \u0027fake news media and their partner the Democrat Party\u0027 for \u0027doing everything within its semi-considerable power to inflame the Coronavirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant.\u0027                  President Trump argued the stock market collapse was due to Russia and Saudi Arabia arguing over the price of oil and also blamed the \u0027Fake News\u0027           President Trump also tried to downplay the wave of coronavirus infections and deaths He then quoted Surgeon General as saying, \u0027The risk is low to the average American.\u0027That last claim is probably true.For most people under 50, in good health, it appears to be a relatively low risk virus.But the risk for elderly and infirm people is extremely high, and the speed of infection of COD-19 - way faster than normal flu - and deadly severity of its impact on people in those group- far worse than normal flu - are genuinely scary.In Italy alone, it has now infected almost as many people as SARS infected worldwide in its entirety, infections are rocketing higher every day, and the mortality rate is running at nearly 5 percent.If the same thing happens in the U.S. then hundreds of thousands of Americans will die.This eventuality would make Trump\u0027s \u0027there\u0027s nothing to worry about\u0027 rebound savagely and perhaps unforgivably in his political face.       Coronavirus patients lie face-down on their hospital beds as they are treated by medical staff in protective suits in Cremona, northern Italy, today. Research has suggested that lying face-down may improve survival chances in intensive care (Ironically, Italy was the first European country to ban flights from China – which is what Trump boasts of doing in America to great effect – and yet it\u0027s suffered the worst outbreak in Europe.)It doesn\u0027t take even a stable genius to work out why Trump is maintaining this \u0027nothing to see here\u0027 stance.If coronavirus runs riot through America, and the economy, his biggest success story, continues to implode, then the President knows he could face the vengeful wrath of voters at the ballot box.Even his die-hard base may drop their unwavering support if their relatives start dying and their business go bust.So, the stakes are potentially very high for President Trump.That\u0027s why he was even reluctant to let Americans off a cruise ship in San Francisco into quarantine, despite the risk to their health aboard a vessel with 21 confirmed cases of the virus - because he said he didn\u0027t want the number of reported US infections to rise.Seriously, Mr President?These people are not just \u0027numbers\u0027 – they\u0027re American citizens who have an absolute right to be back on U.S. soil.       Welch died last week, and his long-time friend Donald Trump paid fulsome tribute to him: \u0027There was no corporate leader like \u0027Neutron Jack\u0027, he tweeted. \u0027He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together.\u0027 Trump (L) greets former General Electric CEO Jack Welch at the beginning of a policy forum in the State Dining Room at the White House February 3, 2017 in Washington, DC To be perfectly frank, I don\u0027t care right now about what coronavirus means for Trump politically.I care about coronavirus means for public health.And the President\u0027s normal swaggering, loose-tongued, fact-challenged, wise-cracking style of leadership just doesn\u0027t work on something as serious as this.On Friday, during his weird and woeful press conference, he boasted about having a \u0027supergenius\u0027 scientist uncle at MIT, and then said: \u0027I like this stuff, I really get it, people are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, \u0027How do you know so much about this?\u0027 Maybe I have a natural ability?\u0027No offence, Mr President, but everything you\u0027re been saying about COD-19 to date suggests you have absolutely no idea what the hell you\u0027re dealing with.As your friend Jack Welch said, face reality as it is, not what you want it to be.I strongly suggest you stop your absurdly premature victory tour, leave the expert talk to the experts and start taking coronavirus a lot more seriously, before it\u0027s too late - for Americans, and for your presidency. "},{"url":null,"title":"Piers Morgan blasts Meghan Markle got wants","story":"Think pink like Susanna in a dress by Heidi HigginsBuy it hereThanks to stylist Debbie Harper, Susanna Reid is always dressed to impress for Good Morning Britain.Today, the presenter looked spring-ready in a beautiful pink dress by Heidi Higgins.

Few would assume that the person behind the lens is the protagonists’ mum.In Nicolas \u0026amp Adrien: A World With Two Sons, which binds together two interconnected bodies of work – Teen Tribe (2005-10) and The Twenties (2010-18) – Fougeron beautifully captures her sons and their assorted friends and lovers as they incrementally journey from innocence to experience at their family home in the Bronx, New York, and during holidays in the south of France.With inidual picture titles ranging from Don’t Bogart That Joint, My Friend to Dress to Get Laid Party: Adrien Getting Ready, Fougeron is without question a cool mum. Still, she long hesitated before embarking on her project.In the early 00s, the single mother resigned from her post as a creative director in the perfume industry. “I came home late on 911 and Adrien told me, ‘You were the only parent not at school today.’ It hit me then that I was travelling so much and estranged from my sons.”Shortly after, Fougeron began taking reportage portraits of them and what she describes as their highly conscious, “911-Facebook-Occupy-Wall-Street generation” as a way to reconnect. She also sought to produce an alternative to the dominant depiction of adolescents as invariably angst-ridden.Initially, Nicolas wasn’t too thrilled. “Especially in your teens, you don’t want to share everything with your mother,” he tells me, sitting with his mum and brother in his gran’s living room. “And this entailed that I would share a lot more than a regular teen would.”He overcame that initial reluctance upon observing his mother’s elaborate mise-en-scène: shooting with a large-format camera in a painterly fashion, inspired by Vermeer’s domestic interiors, worlds away from a snapshot, documentary aesthetic. Seeing the images framed as art pieces, and being given a right of veto over anything they didn’t like, also helped both sons embrace their mother’s project as something more than a mere diary of their lives. “It was a tremendous privilege and gift, even though at times it felt more like a burden,” acknowledges Nicolas.Now a film-maker and multidisciplinary artist respectively, Nicolas and Adrien recognise how this close-knit collaboration played a foundational role in their creative pursuits. “I feel like we really started photographing together,” Adrien says, flipping through the book. “You helped me a lot with lighting,” Martine says. “Sometimes, you also had lots to say about my framing.”Fougeron’s work is indebted to Pictures from Home, Larry Sultan’s stunning meditation on his parents ageing in Reagan-era America, which cultivates a similar ambiguity between the staged and the spontaneous. But the most striking point of comparison has to be Richard Linklater’s Boyhood, a painstaking cinematic journey that took 12 years to film and which charts the young Mason’s development from inquisitive child to sharp-eyed, sensitive young man.Like the Texan film-maker, Fougeron deftly avoids the trap of dramatic coming-of-age cliches, opting instead to highlight “in-between” events in her sons’ lives: gentler, more introspective moments, the emotional impact of which grows when viewed cumulatively. Take, for instance, Adrien holding up a phallically defaced copy of The Catcher in the Rye on the subway, or Nicolas camping out at New York’s Zuccotti Park during Occupy Wall Street. The power of Linklater and Fougeron’s far-reaching visual bildungsromans resides in their sense of uncertainty: these boys are in the process of becoming their future selves, but everything remains possible as they move through the volatile landscape of adolescence.Mother and sons acknowledge the comparisons to Boyhood, with Nicolas adding that while Fougeron “loves a good gossip, she also wasn’t out to capture the drama in our lives”. Was she after heightened impressions of adolescence, then? “I wanted to restage what I had experienced strongly, which I also saw in them,” she explains, adding to her sons: “You guys made me discover new things, but I also recognised things I myself had lived through intensely. And when I saw those, I thought: these are photos I must take.”Adrien alludes to the book’s “underlying sexual component,” an interesting element to consider in light of other family-themed projects by female photographers like Sally Mann or Tierney Gearon who have been criticised for depicting their children naked. Fougeron consciously avoided that perilous route. “Certainly I could have taken those types of images but I thought that would be trespassing on my sons and their friends,” she says. “To me, the overarching impression is more sweet and intimate, which is a reflection of my sons’ loving relationships with their girlfriends.”“But that’s also what makes your work interesting,” adds Adrien. “There is sexuality in Larry Clark and Sally Mann’s photographs, but I think if you can express sexuality without nudity, that’s really powerful.”Fougeron intends to carry on with the project well into her sons’ adult lives, albeit less intensely. “The 30s are more spaced out than the teens, so not every week,” she notes. Nicolas, who has permanently relocated to Paris, shoots me a conspiratorial look that suggests his mother’s access to her models may still need to be ironed out. “I’m just as surprised as you are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60dd612657841153ebff3cc8a64cfb5233ccb5d1/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2697d18382442a2814124f59b932dcf0","title":"rock classics the most extraordinary stone buildings on earth in pictures","story":"An aqueduct without mortar, a tilting library, a house sandwiched between two boulders … Stone, a new book by William Hall, celebrates some of the world’s finest buildings, built with one of its oldest and most durable materials"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed07c784dff558fdd03797c45d249732ee500234/0_93_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53901404d526fc79ab3d6cccd53013d9","title":"the mirror and the light shines with huge first week sales","story":"Hilary Mantel’s conclusion to her Thomas Cromwell trilogy sold more than 95,000 copies in three daysHilary Mantel’s much-anticipated The Mirror and the Light has been selling a copy every 2.7 seconds since its release last Thursday, with the final book in the two-time Booker winner’s trilogy selling more than 95,000 print copies in just three days.According to figures from sales monitor Nielsen BookScan, 5p in every £1 spent on books in the UK last week went towards a copy of The Mirror and the Light. After an eight-year wait since the last book, 2012’s Bring Up the Bodies, excited fans lined up to buy the novel at bookshops around the UK at midnight on Wednesday.The new novel follows 2009’s Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies to complete Mantel’s Thomas Cromwell trilogy. Widely praised by critics, a good number of whom predicted that it will win Mantel her third Booker prize, the 900-page novel follows Cromwell’s final ascent to unprecedented riches and honour in the service of King Henry VIII, before his abrupt fall from royal favour and public execution at Tower Hill in 1540.The fortunes of Mantel’s trilogy have been nowhere near as turbulent. Bolstered by two Booker prize wins, a West End play and a BBC miniseries Wolf Hall made Mantel the first Booker winner to win the UK overall No 1 spot. The first two books have sold more than 1.5m copies around the world.The Mirror and the Light is also on track to overtake sales of Margaret Atwood’s sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale, The Testaments, which sold 103,177 copies in its first five days. Neither, however, overtook Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchmen, which sold 168,455 print copies in its first week in 2015.

The UK is the 51st state in all but name, right? In reality, the similarities are more complex, and the differences are stark.You can understand where the idea comes from. On both sides of the Atlantic 40 years of Reaganite and Thatcherite policies of financial deregulation, union emasculation, and a sanguine attitude to de-industrialisation, have sculpted Anglo-American society in similar ways: declining life expectancy among those whose communities destroyed as a consequence of these policies and a surviving population that blames immigrants for their problems.The political response to these economic and social conditions has been the election of two unsuitable philanderers, Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. Both were initially resisted by party elites, who then abjectly surrendered. All dissenters have been purged. Their advisers are bizarre, comic book villain-types such as Stephen Miller and Dominic Cummings.However, the differences between Labour and the Democrats remain profound. The sudden revival of Joe Biden’s fortunes is proof. Both parties are lazily described as being of the “left” but really, America hasn’t had a “left” in the British sense as long as I’ve been alive, which is a very long time.The Labour party was from its inception a socialist party, and even though clause IV was taken out of the party’s constitution the ideology of public ownership runs strong in the membership and recent leadership of the party. The “left” wing of the US Democratic party embraces the legacy of Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal – but while his opponents in the 1930s called it “socialism”, it wasn’t. Actual socialism never found a foothold in the US – perhaps because it was commonly called “godless socialism”, especially in the south. America is a damned religious country. And Americans have traditionally had no problem with billionaires – perhaps because many of them fervently believe in the American myth that anyone can get rich if they work hard enough. The tragedy of Bernie Sanders is that he is a New Deal Democrat but insists on calling himself a socialist. You don’t win in America using that language. The sudden revival of Biden’s fortunes is proof.Then there’s the governmental structures these political forces operate within. In Britain, the executive is housed in the legislature. Johnson leads a well-whipped majority and a prime minister with a majority of this size is in charge of an “elective dictatorship”. In the US, the executive branch of government is separate from the legislature. This check on presidential power is profound, especially when, as is the case now, one of the branches of Congress is in the control of the opposition party.Barack Obama found that out when he tried to appoint Merrick Garland to the supreme court and the Republican-controlled Senate, which has the constitutional role of approving high court judges, would not give Garland the courtesy of a hearing. Trump found the limits to his power when the Democrats took over the House of Representatives and tied him up in impeachment.The Senate, unlike the House of Lords, is not appointed. It is elected. Senators need to pander to voters successfully, unlike for example, Zac Goldsmith, who was elevated to the Lords – and returned to the cabinet – after losing his seat in the last election.Then there is money. In the US there is tons of it surrounding elections. Unimaginable sums, really: $6.5bn was spent on the 2016 presidential election across all races, with most of that money going on broadcast media advertising. There has always been money in American politics, but in the past decade it has grown to narco-trafficker levels of cash.In 2010, the supreme court decided – in the case titled Citizens United v Federal Election Commission – that corporations had first amendment rights – free speech rights, like iniduals – and putting restrictions on corporations giving money to air political advertisements in broadcast media was an infringement of that right. Since then the cash has flowed in and Americans are bombarded with paid political propaganda non stop.In the UK there is no first amendment and there are firm restrictions on political advertising on television and radio. Party political broadcasts are strictly rationed and election campaigns take place within tightly defined windows. But there is a “free” press. Conservative politicians don’t need to raise money for advertising, they get it for free. Every day, outside every newsagent, there is a rack of blaring headlines trumpeting Conservative policies or viewpoints. They’re not far off the billboards that line US highways. Decades of exposure to them, and it’s no wonder that Brexit won.Clearly, when it comes to propaganda channels, both countries have them, which brings me back to where I started: Anglo-America. Maybe some day Anglo-America will be a reality – after Brexit negotiations collapse, and the UK disintegrates, and England applies to become the 51st state. Then American politics and English politics will be the same. But that will not happen this electoral cycle or the next. The US is still a very, very different country.• Michael Goldfarb is the host of the podcast FRDH, First Rough Draft of History"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94ba011e3c7e9c833789879453f4d8d8d58d6c01/576_248_4479_2688/master/4479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4aba9c1e9deeb10365f6bfe57d830020","title":"resilient levelled up uk budget green zero carbon industry","story":"This week’s budget will be the first passed by parliament since MPs declared a climate emergency, but it could be the last before the UK hosts the Cop26 climate talks later this year.Many people have drawn legitimate comparisons between the respective responses to coronavirus and the climate crisis – both big shocks to the economy. But it’s important not to lose sight of why the response to Covid-19 has been so rushed and dramatic – we were caught by surprise. We have not, however, been taken by surprise by the climate crisis.If we let things get to that point with our climate – whether through increased water scarcity, coastal flooding or wildfires – the consequences will not only be severe and tragic, but unlike an epidemic they will also be long-lasting.And so this week’s budget can’t afford to miss the bigger picture it must be a climate budget. Measures to contain or delay the spread of disease will be a necessity. But that won’t be an excuse to detract from efforts to mitigate and adapt to the climate emergency in a way that serves society.The problems facing the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are clear. To reach net zero, annual household emissions of carbon will need to fall from about 8,000kg of C02 today to not much more than 1,000kg by 2050. The largest reductions will need to be in heating, transport and electricity. But while good progress has been made to reduce emissions from the UK’s power sector, we are far behind in almost every other part of the economy. According to the Committee on Climate Change, the UK remains behind schedule in all but seven of its 24 indicators to reach even our previous legally binding emissions targets, before these were increased to “net zero by 2050”.More importantly, we know private investment alone won’t cut it. This is partly because many of the risks in developing new technology are too high without significant government support. But we also know creating greener jobs in the right places is unlikely to succeed if we rely on markets alone. The UK remains one of the most regionally unequal countries in Europe, with GDP per head about three times higher in Milton Keynes compared with the Wirral. Transitioning to zero-carbon industry must be used to address the geographical imbalance of our economy at the same time.For the chancellor then, this is a no-brainer yes, invest in the regions you want to level up, but make that investment green and you’ll be putting those places – and the country – on track for a more resilient and fairer economy as well.Alongside investment, we also need to raise money to pay for higher day-to-day spending, such as for new skills training and a stronger social safety net for the most affected regions. At the same time, an ageing population and reduced inward migration are likely to shrink tax – and increase the costs of older age care – over exactly the same period.So the chancellor will likely be considering some higher taxes, and wherever possible these will need to be green too. Things like replacing air passenger duty with a frequent flyer levy will help, as will replacing fuel duty with a more progressive alternative. Cuts to national insurance – costing billions, disproportionately benefiting higher income households and doing nothing to reshape consumption – will not.Get this right now, and the chancellor will not only help address existential threat, but he could give us the chance of becoming a healthier and fairer society for a generation. Get this wrong, and history will judge cruelly. Being resigned to last-minute damage limitation is an inevitability with an epidemic, but with the climate crisis it is ours to choose.• Alfie Stirling is head of economics at the New Economics Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb9bf265938a6ee4bcfc95d5c6c5502491a129b2/157_113_3343_2007/master/3343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c91d807e0b7f1fe148735a191ff197f4","title":"saudi rul prince mohammed bin salman struck first crackdown","story":"All is not well in the House of Saud. On 7 March, Mohammed bin Salman, the young crown prince and future king of Saudi Arabia, boldly dispatched his masked security personnel to bring two of Saudi’s most senior princes, Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz and Muhammad bin Nayef, to the palace after a hunting trip in the desert. It’s still unclear whether they have been detained for short-term interrogations or to be imprisoned. What’s certain is that Prince Mohammed’s decision was a preemptive strike to intimidate those who have dared question his leadership style from inside the royal household. Although Mohammed is the crown prince, he plays the role of king. He remains in control of all economic, political, social and foreign relations, and eclipses his father, King Salman, as unofficial ruler of Saudi Arabia.The arrests were ordered after the royal court was passed details of an alleged plot to undermine Prince Mohammed’s ascendance to the throne. Among the two princes he arrested, Ahmed is the most eligible to become king – he is the only remaining brother of the incumbent King Salman and would have been first in line had his brother not promoted his own heir, much to Ahmed’s chagrin.Still, a fully-fledged palace coup is unlikely: Prince Mohammed controls the security, intelligence and military capabilities of the kingdom. No other prince can mobilise enough troops to march on the palace and depose a man with the coercive powers of the state at his disposal. It’s more likely that the detained princes were planning on withdrawing their support should Mohammed become king. In order to ascend to the throne, he will seek the bay’ah, the oath of allegiance given by the most senior princes represented in the 33-member committee of allegiance that was established by King Abdullah in 2008.Both Ahmed bin Abzul Aziz and Muhammad bin Nayef are members of this committee, and Prince Mohammed likely knows they won’t rush to offer their support. Though the young prince doesn’t technically need the bay’ah’s seal of approval to become king, he will be isolated without it – and his rule will lack the legitimacy essential for a smooth succession.Further arrests will offer no protection against this leadership crisis. Prince Mohammed finds himself at the centre of a struggle that began with his predecessors. Successive kings have ruled Saudi Arabia as their own private fiefdom, denying Saudi citizens the right to any role in the country’s domestic and foreign affairs. The Saudi royal family has pushed back against demands to transform the absolute monarchy into a constitutional one, with an elected national assembly and government that could deal with power vacuums and leadership struggles within the royal household.Had Saudi kings accepted a constitutional transformation of the monarchy, issues of succession could have been resolved without resorting to the arrests of rival princes. In Kuwait, for example, an independent national assembly votes on succession, mitigating against bitter monarchical rivalries.Though the prince built his reputation as a young moderniser, garnering favour among the western media as a monarch who could free Saudi Arabia from the shackles of religious conservatism, economic stagnation and a state-controlled economy, his idea of progress was always two-faced. Prince Mohammed allowed women to drive while presiding over the arrests of women’s rights activists and the criminalisation of feminism. He promised religious reforms and social liberalisation while detaining hundreds of religious scholars, activists and intellectuals.The young prince silenced debates inside the kingdom and pursued his critics abroad. The brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was the final stroke in shattering his international reputation, while his decision to pursue a disastrous war in Yemen has embarrassed his western allies, which continue to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.But his propaganda abroad and deployment of thinktanks that promote his interests abroad and launder his reputation among a western political elite, ensured that he remained the preferred candidate of Donald Trump.His other western allies, above all Britain and France, turned a blind eye to the prince’s scandals as he continued to promise them investment and arms sales. When faced with a choice between trade or sanctions, western governments opted for the former – remaining silent over Saudi Arabia’s record on domestic repression, its war in Yemen and the fracturing of consensus among Gulf countries following Saudi Arabia’s dispute with Qatar in 2014.The current leadership crisis is a clear sign that the future of reform in Saudi Arabia remains ambiguous at best. Without a consensus over his reforms and foreign and domestic policies, Prince Mohammed has resorted to repression. As the young prince attempts to tighten his hold on power, we can expect more arrests to follow.• Madawi al-Rasheed is a visiting professor at the London School of Economics’s Middle East Centre and the author of Salman’s Legacy: The Dilemmas of a new Era in Saudi Arabia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4a6bdc02421a4793b81e3cfec93ff5b6cc6a02f/0_206_4885_2931/master/4885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e3dede1728b839bf21d1a8bca3e6db4","title":"the guardian view on mexicos womens strike let the machistas tremble","story":"Tens of thousands of women, perhaps many more, disappeared in Mexico on Monday. They vanished from the streets, from cafes, from shops and factories and offices. Their absence was a manifestation of their fury, a demonstration of how impoverished the country would be without them, and a symbolic representation of the women who are for ever missing from the country, having been murdered because they are women.The homicide rate has risen sharply in recent years: more than 10 women a day are being killed. Two particularly horrific crimes have galvanised action. The first was the murder of 25-year-old Ingrid Escamilla last month, and the publication of pictures of her mutilated body by local media. The second, days later, was the abduction, torture and murder of a seven-year-old girl, Fátima Cecilia Aldrighett Antón.But Monday’s women’s strike, and the mammoth demonstration that preceded it on Sunday, targeted not only the perpetrators, but authorities that have failed to tackle the violence. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has shown at best indifference to the problem and at worst indignation that women are protesting against it. He has blamed femicides on the “neoliberal” policies of his predecessors, and portrayed feminist activism as part of a rightwing plot against him, suggesting that some of the campaigners want his administration to fail. Last month, when a reporter asked about femicides, he grumbled that he didn’t want the issue to overshadow his plans to raffle off the presidential plane.The protest movement is much more than an expression of mourning for those denied their lives. It is a necessary social response to a social problem, in Mexico and around the globe (the UK too has seen a rise in female homicide victims). While the rate and patterns of violence vary immensely, nowhere is immune. “In rich and poor countries, in developed and developing regions, a total of 50,000 women per year are killed by their current and former partners, fathers, brothers, mothers, sisters and other family members because of their role and status as women,” a United Nations report found in 2018. In Mexico and elsewhere, the problem of femicide, and the abuse of women more broadly, is not only a problem of violent men. It is also the problem of the laws and cultures that permit and reproduce them. The song A Rapist in Your Path, created by a Chilean feminist collective, has been taken up in countries from France to Kenya because when it urges “let the machistas tremble” it means not only perpetrators, but “the cops, the judges, the state, the president”. The UN report calls not only for better laws, but also better coordination between agencies. It urges countries to adopt approaches that are women-centred, rather than those that treat women as “objects of protection or sources of evidence”.Mexico’s strike drew upon those held in Argentina, Poland, Spain and elsewhere, as well as the country’s own traditions of activism. Women are demanding that their lives be valued. Feminist campaigners face a backlash, expressed at times in physical violence as well as verbal abuse and threats. Yet we are seeing a wave of women’s protest around the world, from the #NiUnaMenos – “not one less” – movement against gender-based abuse and killings, which began in Argentina, to the #MeToo movement and onwards. The need for it is enraging. But the activism is remarkable, courageous and inspiring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54216b754d6694ce51acd0dcb35fde6292b8f6aa/0_0_941_575/master/941.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f5f0b913fdbc551d59ee120b32850287 1400w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of abundance","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘abundance’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘abundance’.Share your photos of what abundance means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 11 March at 10am.

The report concludes it was a record-breaking year for heat, and there was rising hunger, displacement and loss of life owing to extreme temperatures and floods around the world. Scientists said the threat was greater than that from the coronavirus, and world leaders must not be erted away from climate action.The climate assessment is led by the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with input from the UN’s agencies for environment, food, health, disasters, migration and refugees, as well as scientific centres.The report says results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate 2018-19 was the 32nd year in a row in which more ice was lost than gained. The melting of land ice combined with thermal expansion of water pushed sea levels up to the highest mark since records began. The long-term decline of Arctic sea ice also continued in 2019, with the September average extent – usually the lowest of the year – the third worst on record.“Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5C or 2C targets that the Paris agreement calls for,” said Guterres. 2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. “Time is fast running out for us to avert the worst impacts of climate disruption and protect our societies.”Prof Brian Hoskins, of Imperial College London, said: “The report is a catalogue of weather in 2019 made more extreme by climate change, and the human misery that went with it. It points to a threat that is greater to our species than any known virus – we must not be erted from the urgency of tackling it by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to zero as soon as possible.”Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API\u0026nbspwarned\u0026nbspthe industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist\u0026nbspJames Hansen testifies to the US Senate\u0026nbspthat “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.The WMO said its report provided authoritative information for policymakers on the need for climate action and showed the impacts of extreme weather.A heatwave in Europe was made five times more likely by global heating, and the scorching summer led to 20,000 emergency hospital admissions and 1,462 premature deaths in France alone. India and Japan also sweltered and Australia started and ended the year with severe heat and had its driest year on record. Australia had “an exceptionally prolonged and severe fire season”, the WMO noted.Floods and storms contributed most to displacing people from their homes, particularly Cyclone Idai in Mozambique and its neighbours, Cyclone Fani in south Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. The number of internal displacements from such disasters is estimated to have been close to 22 million people in 2019, up from 17 million in 2018.The US saw heavy rains, with the total from July 2018 to June 2019 being the highest on record. Total economic losses in the US for the year were estimated at $20bn, the WMO said.Unpredictable climate and extreme weather was a factor in 26 of the 33 nations that were hit by food crises in 2019, and was the main driver in 12 of the countries. “After a decade of steady decline, hunger is on the rise again – over 820 million suffered from hunger in 2018, the latest global data available,” the report says.The WMO said unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 was also a factor in the severe desert locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa, which is the worst for decades and expected to spread further by June 2020 in a severe threat to food security.Prof Dave Reay, of the University of Edinburgh, said: “This annual litany of climate change impacts and inadequate global responses makes for a gut-wrenching read. Writ large is the ‘threat multiplier’ effect that is climate change on the biggest challenges faced by humanity and the world’s ecosystems in the 21st century.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d41bfd73983fe6a41d78ac3821a6ec624e956e/0_194_5605_3363/master/5605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c55439298478992b08e7c79d6cc0e83d","title":"more funds needed for new trees in england say campaigners","story":"Government failing on pledge to plant 30,000 hectares by 2024, says Friends of the EarthTree-planting is one of the government’s key strategies for fighting the climate crisis, but ministers have got off to a slow start that shows little sign of speeding up, according to the latest figures: just £5.2m will be spent on new trees in England under the countryside stewardship scheme for the current financial year.That is enough for only 1,260 hectares, according to Friends of the Earth, which is calling for far more effort on tree-planting to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.By the end of this parliament, by current plans – revealed in the answer to a parliamentary question by the Labour MP Kerry McCarthy – about £27m will be spent, enough for about 6,500 hectares of forest.These sums fall far short of the 30,000 hectares of new trees that the government has pledged.Friend of the Earth revealed last year that ministers were failing to meet targets on trees, despite assurances from the government that forestry would form a central plank of the push to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Less than £2 per person was being spent on forestry, research found.Each of the major parties included substantial tree-planting pledges in their manifestos at last autumn’s general election. However, details from the government on how this will be achieved have so far been scant.The agriculture bill currently progressing through parliament will put in place a broad legal framework for rewarding farmers for providing public goods, such as tree planting, but there have been no concrete plans yet from ministers on how much farmers can expect to be paid, when and how such schemes will be managed.There are also increasing questions over the strategy, which has the backing in principle of many environmental groups, but which must be worked out in careful detail if new forests are to be sited in the right places, so as to preserve existing habitats and not lead to further unintended emissions.For instance, experts warned the  this week that commercial forests would result in little gain in the UK’s ability to store carbon. They also warned that trees planted in the wrong places could increase emissions – for instance, planting trees in some peatland dries out the peat and causes it to release carbon into the air.Other plantations can threaten local birds and wildlife if not carefully managed.He said: “Ministers love to talk about planting more trees to fight the climate emergency, but seem unprepared to put their money where their mouth is. We have enough land but not yet the political will.”He called on the chancellor of the exchequer to act in Wednesday’s budget. “This budget is an opportunity to free up funding to create and maintain woodlands. Nature benefits from more trees, people feel better, and of course trees help combat climate change so there is absolutely no excuse to skimp on this funding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a515957b916b9e5724dd733ce3bf99f32112607/2_0_1012_607/master/1012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=338449193f5da3c31ceee99d4bce1d27","title":"why cycling in palestine is an intensely political act","story":"Riding is way of thumbing the nose at occupation and connecting with the land Are you annoyed by the anti-motorcycle barriers or speed bumps on your local bike path? Spare a thought for Palestinian bicycle advocates. According to the UN, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank imposes 705 obstacles to the free movement of Palestinians.These obstacles include military checkpoints where only those with permits can pass, a 440-mile separation barrier, and roving patrols that can turn a joyous bike ride into humiliating roadside detention.For Palestinian paramedic Sohaib Samara and other cyclists in the region, pedalling is not just about fresh air and exercise it’s intensely, unavoidably political.On one ride when he and a friend were pulled over by an Israeli army patrol, Samara says he heard the soldiers asking, in Hebrew, whether they should shoot the pair in the arms.“Your brain starts to wander in dark places when, really, you just want to keep cycling,” he added.Riding around the West Bank is a way of thumbing the nose at occupation, but it is also a way of connecting with the land bicycling as a form of affirmative action.In 2016, Samara launched Ramallah Riders, a Facebook group for would-be cyclists in the West Bank town of Ramallah, six miles north of Jerusalem. Four years later, the group now has 3,000 members and, in recognition of wider West Bank membership, is today known as Cycling Palestine.When I lived in Jerusalem for six months in 1984 – having ridden to Israel on my Claud Butler Majestic touring bike – I used to ride out to West Bank villages on weekends with an Israeli friend. We were welcomed with handshakes and mint tea. We were exotic, but we were on bicycles, a form of locomotion that identified us as harmless idiots to Palestinians and Israelis alike.Israel has since had something of a bicycling boom. Along with amenities such as a billionaire-backed velodrome, it also now has protected cycleways, and the Giro d’Italia pro-cycling race spent three days in the country in 2018. But despite the best efforts of Cycling Palestine, the West Bank remains a bicycling backwater.Ignoring the barbs, Samara continued to cycle.“We’ve been doing this for over four years now people have lost hope in us,” joked Malak Hasan, Cycling Palestine’s co-organiser. “They’re now more accepting.”I was speaking to Samara and Hasan in the foyer of the Manger Square Hotel in Bethlehem after an e-bike tour of the city, a new weekly organised ride which had taken me past highlights such as Banksy’s Walled Off Hotel, a greater draw for some than the town’s Church of the Nativity.The e-bike tour aims to get tourists out of buses to see the “real” Bethlehem.This isn’t always easy in the West Bank. It’s hilly, it’s hot for much of the year, and cycling is still considered an odd thing to do, especially for women.The cultural stigma – a barrier to bicycling – is lower for men. “Men can embark on amazing adventures because no one will be asking where this man is sleeping. Where is he going? Is he alone?”After a four-day, 300-mile group ride in 2017 from the Qalandiya refugee camp near Ramallah to Jordan’s Aqaba, Hasan returned to stinging rebukes. She was one of only two women on the 11-person trip.“Most of the comments were like, ‘how could you sleep in tents and on deserted roads with nine men?’ The expectation is for a woman to be at home, taking care of babies, being decent and modest.”Hasan’s husband doesn’t cycle, “but,” she stated proudly, “he’s very supportive”.She learned to love cycling when studying for a master’s degree in communication in Swansea.One of Cycling Palestine’s recent tours was a multi-day, 70-person tour following the full length of the separation barrier: their own form of rolling resistance.“It is our duty to keep our relationship with this land,” said Samara. “If we stop moving around, the occupiers will steal more of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c3712de1a03ca0b3da6e24b0c51561c96f657f/184_531_2256_1353/2256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d77fc3231acded90398dc5c678b15ccd","title":"the seventh seal to the exorcist max von sydow a life in pictures","story":"Swedish actor Max von Sydow has died at the age of 90.

Email feast@theI’ve tried to replicate paellas I’ve had in Spain, but none matches the colour, fragrance and subtlety of the real thing. Where am I going wrong?Chris, Paignton, DevonSpanish uber-chef Quique Dacosta, who last year opened his first UK restaurant, the paella-based Arros QD in London, agrees: “All the ingredients are important, but the king is the stock, because that’s where much of the flavour comes from.” For this reason, he never uses concentrate or cube, and insists it’s made from scratch, “mainly because you have no control over its quality otherwise, and also because the whole paella ritual always starts with the stock”.Angel Zapata Martin, head chef at the four-strong Barrafina group of restaurants in London, makes his stock first by roasting the bones, trimmings and shells of whatever meat or seafood he’s using in the paella, then puts them in a pot with shallot, carrot, fennel, garlic, tomato paste and pimientos choricero (dried pepper) or pimentón, all topped with water. “The secret is not to use too much, or you’ll end up with a bland stock,” he says. “Three fingers above the solids is plenty.”The type of rice is also critical, all three cooks agree, and it has to be Spanish medium-grain. Pizarro and Dacosta recommend senia rice from Valencia, the home of paella, but say bomba or albufera will also do the trick Zapata is rather more specific: “The rice is key – I use only Illa de Riu bomba from southern Catalunya, which benefits from the rich soil in which its grown.”Paella is, of course, named after the pan in which it’s traditionally made, and Dacosta is adamant you shouldn’t really call it paella if it’s not cooked in one: “It’s just not the same in a frying pan.” Zapata, however, isn’t quite so strict on this particular score: “Yes, a proper paella pan is preferable,” he agrees, “but the closest you have to a very wide, flat pan should be OK.”Once you’ve fried off the sofrito base – diced onion, garlic, tomato and, perhaps, red pepper – and browned the meat, stir in the rice to coat, pour in the stock … and leave well alone: “Never stir paella,” Pizarro warns, a sentiment Zapata endorses: “It makes the rice go stodgy and mushy.” We’re not making a risotto here, after all.Dacosta uses 1,200ml stock per 240g rice, and cooks it for 20 minutes precisely – “We start counting the moment the stock goes in the pan” – until the liquid’s absorbed and the rice is plump. The Valencian way, he says, is to end up with a thin layer of flavour-filled rice with a crisp base, or soccarat. To get the same effect, Zapata recommends leaving the pan on the heat for a short while after the rice is cooked, “until you hear it sizzle and see the edges crisp”. Mind you, Dacosta adds, “not all paellas have soccarat and not everyone loves it”.Another flaw of many a dodgy paella, Dacosta says, is that “the vegetables are often horribly overcooked by the time the rice is ready”, so add them only after it’s half-cooked. “And always use proper saffron,” Pizarro says, “never turmeric or colourant – that’s sacrilege.”A scattering of fresh herbs and a dash of lemon is all you really need to finish, but for a more cheffy flourish, Zapata adds a picada for a last hit of flavour: “Blend saffron, raw or roast garlic and white wine, then pour all over the paella and leave to soak in for a few minutes before serving.” ¡Buen provecho!• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Then again, we’ve been set up with plenty of open goals over the years, too, and we’ve missed nearly all of those as well. So it’s not as though you’re going to notice much difference. What we will say is, hats off to the socially responsible Pepe Reina, Frédéric Guilbert, Björn Engels, Tyrone Mings and Matt Targett, who diligently self-isolated on Monday, operating independently in exclusion zones miles apart from each other, thus ensuring nobody in the Aston Villa defence had any chance of catching anything. Sadly, this had the unfortunate knock-on effect of ensuring none of them were able to catch Harvey Barnes or Jamie Vardy either, but in times of national emergency you have to make sacrifices. What did you do in the war, daddy? Keep calm and etc.Relegation now looks increasingly likely at Villa Park, though our insider mole tells us they’re well stocked on bog roll, so it’s not all doom and gloom. Elsewhere, news is similarly mixed. Wolves are due to play the first leg of their Big Vase last-16 tie at Olympiakos on Thursday behind closed doors, while Manchester United will do the same with their trip to LASK. Next week’s Barcelona-Napoli Big Cup tie will also be played in conditions that make your average Scottish League Two gathering look like the 1950 World Cup final, while La Liga and Ligue 1 will be similarly spectator-lite for the next fortnight and beyond. In addition, Wednesday’s big Bundesliga derby between Borussia Mönchengladbach and Cologne will be a turnstiles-shut affair as well. Hmm, all that news isn’t particularly mixed, is it? It’s doom and gloom squared, on the end of a shiny stick.Even more seriously, Nottingham Forest and Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis has announced that “the recent virus has visited me”, four days after taking in Forest’s home capitulation to Millwall. Happily, he goes on to say that he “feels good” as he takes “all the necessary measures and I discipline to the doctors instructions. I strongly advise all my fellow citizens to do the same. I wish all a quick recovery.” Whether or not this signals a spread of suspensions and closed-door matches across the UK is moot right now, though as things stand the Premier League will carry on as normal. The Fiver wonders whether a few of its officials will secretly be hoping Manchester City drop points against Arsenal andor Burnley later this week, in the hope of getting at least something definitely decided sooner rather than later, when everything really spirals out of control.

At first glance, you could be forgiven for thinking little or no effort had gone into the bland pennant Marcel Sabitzer will hand over before kick-off. But squint a little harder: it’s been designed to look like a polo shirt. Full marks for busting tapered-flag convention wide open, if nothing else.By way of contrast, Hugo Lloris will be gifting this far more classical bit of official tat. Spurs will be playing in dark blue, incidentally, forced into the change because Leipzig’s first-choice colours are also white.Leipzig make one change to the side sent out at the all-new Spurs stadium three weeks ago. The 21-year-old French defender Dayot Upamecano replaces Ethan Ampadu, the 19-year-old Welsh loanee from Chelsea, at the back.Tottenham make four changes to the side defeated in the first leg. Davinson Sanchez, Ben Davies, Gedson Fernandes and Steven Bergwijn make way for Japhet Tanganga, Ryan Sessegnon, Eric Dier and Erik Lamela. Of those dropped, only Fernandes is named as a sub. Sanchez meanwhile failed a fitness test youth-team defender Malachi Fagan-Walcott, 18 tomorrow, gets a surprise call-up to the bench as a result.This looks like an uphill battle for Spurs, who at the halfway point of this Champions League round-of-16 tie, are trailing to knockout new boys RB Leipzig after a 0-1 loss at home. Jose Mourinho’s men have lost four of their last five fixtures in all competitions, drawing the other slightly fortuitously at Burnley on Saturday. They need to snap that run with victory tonight, though their record this season of four wins in 21 away matches in all competitions won’t fill them with too much confidence. Nor will the fact they’ve lost all three of their matches against Bundesliga opposition in this campaign: the first leg of this tie, plus 3-1 and 7-2 defeats to Bayern Munich in the groups.But all is not lost. In-form Leipzig may have won three and drawn two of their last five games, but they’ve already lost at home in the Champions League this season, to Lyon. The 0-2 scoreline that evening is exactly the one Spurs require to get through. Additionally, while Tottenham’s 2019-20 record against German teams is abysmal, they brushed aside Borussia Dortmund at this stage last season. And it’s impossible to forget their last knockout tie in which they lost the first leg 0-1 at home. Spurs may not have won the competition last season, but they’ll always have Amsterdam.So this is balanced nicely. In Leipzig’s favour, yes, but Spurs are far from out of it. And while Jose Mourinho has his critics - whisper it, more than one or two, we’ve heard - he knows a thing or two about inspiring Champions League wins that looked almost impossible on paper. Just ask Manchester United (279 European Cup matches, seen off by Porto in 2004) or Barcelona (317, worked over by Inter in 2010). In that respect, Leipzig (13) will hold him no fears.

Those were different times, more innocent times. There will be no fans tonight, but there will probably be goals: it’s more than a month since either side last kept a clean sheet, and in their most recent league game Atalanta thrashed Lecce 7-2.

There may be a little ring-rustiness, but there should at least be no sign of fatigue. “We need to score, as well as stay focused and defend well,” said Gian Piero Gasperini. “A psychological aspect of our game that we are working on is ... we seem to get comfortable and assume the job is done when it really is not. The team were great in the first leg, but I will not celebrate until the second leg is over.”The Valencia coach, Albert Celades, insisted that “the result from the first leg isn’t a fair reflection of what happened in the game”, which is true: Maxi Gómez displayed the finishing skills of a kitten as he spurned a number of fine chances in that one. He won’t be spurning any chances tonight, though, as he’s kept out by a broken foot. Still, where there’s life there’s hope: “I don’t think we need a miracle to progress, not at all,” surmised Albert Celades.

It was an experience that drove his ambition higher, sowing the seeds for a nation-building project and his decision to run for president.Burundi goes to the polls on 20 May and Nahimana, standing as an independent, has a manifesto of unity.“In our country political parties have developed out of ethnic isions,” he says. “But the people helping my campaign come from all ethnic groups. Together, we are showing it’s time to value life in Burundi.”Burundi was granted independence from colonial Belgian rule.\u0026nbspThe assassination of Hutu prime minister\u0026nbspPierre Ngendandumwe\u0026nbspset in motion a\u0026nbspseries of assassinations, revolts, coups and\u0026nbspregional instability\u0026nbspthat ended with Burundi established as a republic and one-party state.\u0026nbspA Hutu rebellion is brutally crushed leaving 200,000 to 300,000 dead.\u0026nbsp150,000 people die in unrest after a military coup.Burundi\u0027s civil war erupts after the assassination of Hutu leader Melchior Ndadaye. Years of violence between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi army claim 300,000 civilian lives.\u0026nbspMost of the warring factions sign the peace deal iding key government and military posts between Hutu and Tutsi.\u0026nbspPierre Nkurunziza, a former Hutu rebel leader, is elected president.In May Nkurunziza was anointed as eternal supreme guide by the ruling party. But by June he announced that he would not seek another term and step down when his current term ends in 2020.Too often life has seemed to hold low worth in Burundi, whose history has been marked by occupation, civil war and intermittent violence between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis. Last month more than 6,000 bodies were found in six mass graves in Karusi province, the largest discovery since the government began excavations in January in a nationwide programme intended to help the east African country come to terms with its past.Nahimana lost his father and 18 relatives in the civil war and genocide which left 300,000 people dead. He believes ethnic disputes can finally be set aside in the election for a leader to replace President Pierre Nkurunziza, who has held office since the conflict ended in 2005.“This time the elections are going to focus on development and stability of the country, not on fixing the same issues that have been around for a long time,” Nahimana says. “We always knew this election would be the time for a new generation who want something other than the cycle of retribution. For nearly 20 years we’ve been training young people for decision-making positions and we knew they would be ready.”More than 6,000 young people have come through his New Generation leadership programme. They work as government advisers, bank managers, church leaders and in other influential positions, all ready to support his campaign and government, says Nahimana, whose family share his home with approximately 80 former street children.He believes Burundi is ripe for transformation, especially as the 1994 peace accord process of balancing ethnic groups in the army – intended to prevent Hutu rebellions against Tutsi leadership – has now been completed.Yet political violence has persisted in 2015 protesters clashed with police over Nkurunziza’s announcement that he would prolong his presidency and tensions erupted again before a referendum on allowing his third term. About 400,000 people have fled the country and hundreds have been killed. The UN, which has accused the government and its supporters of crimes against humanity, has warned of serious human rights violations.“We are not trying to be the next government in the same way. The government of Burundi has existed in the same way since the 1960s – militarily-led to manage crises – with almost all of the budget and focus on fixing these crises.”If he wins: “The number one priority for us will be to create an environment for peace and healing, because Burundians have been wounded by what happened in the past.“When you live in an environment where you do not know if you will be alive the next day, or if civil war will erupt in five or 10 years, you cannot plan for the future.”He claims he would tackle rampant corruption and remove barriers to young people’s involvement in managing the country – and it would rapidly develop agriculture, he says, pointing to Rwanda as an example of a country with a similar size population and history whose successful development shows what can be done. “In 1996 they were far behind Burundi but they developed quickly using just the resources they had.”As the national Truth and Reconciliation Commission has worked to repair rifts, the government has recognised Nahimana’s “healing memories” project, bringing together the genocide’s young victims and perpetrators. “We raised them to live as one community without considering where they came from.”“Because we are known for our peace and reconciliation work, the media does not attack us,” he says, adding that while there can be no guarantee elections will be free and fair, so far his campaign has observed the electoral commission is doing its job. But protection of the human rights of all Burundians would be an immediate priority – with support from the international community – and there would be an early discussion on rejoining the International Criminal Court, which, in 2017, Burundi became the first country in the world to leave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1e31aa2bfc861edd09c83204130af7f5944bbb5/0_139_2143_1286/master/2143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0feb4948931a8342b38b87d39f7f29f8","title":"schools close in north east kenya after al shabaab targets teachers","story":"Authorities face criticism for withdrawing teaching staff from an already marginalised region where education is badly neededA series of targeted killings of schoolteachers by a militia group in Kenya has seen an exodus of staff and the closure of hundreds of schools across the north-east of the country.Thousands of teachers have left their posts in the past two months following several suspected al-Shabaab attacks in the region.Schools in rural areas near the Somali border have been badly hit. On 13 January, suspected members of the Somalia-based terrorist group al-Shabaab attacked the village of Kamuthe in Garissa county and killed three non-local teachers and destroyed a communication mast.A few days earlier, a boarding school in another remote village in the Dadaab area of Garissa was targeted by al-Shabaab attackers, according to the Kenyan police. They killed three students and a teacher.Predominantly inhabited by ethnic Somalis, north-eastern Kenya shares a long, porous border with Somalia and it is one of the country’s most marginalised areas. It is inhabited mostly by nomadic pastoralists whose access to education has been limited.“When the teachers leave, the students go back to their nomadic lifestyle,” said Ahmed Abdi Mohamed, headteacher of Balambala boarding school, Garissa county, where seven non-local teachers have left in recent weeks.“I see my students looking after animals every day in the village, it pains me but there is nothing I can do. When I ask the parents they tell me why waste their children’s time in an empty school when they can utilise them to look after their livestock.“The local community had already lost hope, it would be difficult to win them back even if we get new teachers because of the nomadic lifestyle. Many of them would have gone to far places with their livestock in search of pasture.”Local leaders and members of parliament argue the mass transfer of teachers by the government is an indication of the continued marginalisation of the region’s people.“The insecurity problem has been going on for many years, but the national government did not take the matter seriously,” he said.Al-Shabaab has staged frequent attacks inside Kenya. In 2015 an attack on Garissa University College killed 148 students.“The national government forced us to keep the schools open symbolically because shutting them down means al-Shabaab would win,” said Mohamed. “But they are not doing anything practical on the ground to help with the continuity of learning.”Leaders have criticised the TSC, the national body responsible for teachers’ employment, for creating an “education crisis” in the region by pulling non-local staff out of schools in the area.The TSC has insisted that teachers will not be posted to the north-eastern region until their safety is assured.“We appreciate the security challenges we are facing but the decision to transfer all non-local teachers from public schools was reckless,” said Maalim. “This jeopardises the future of children in north-eastern Kenya, who have long struggled to meet the national average standards in exams.”Abdinoor Alimahadi, an education technologist who comes from the region, has been campaigning with local governors to adopt available technology to fill the gap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf43c44268a193fabddabd6d905a483a80dbd917/0_0_9000_5400/master/9000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4514c0887b199e67b6156cc4ce7d19","title":"looking for love wash your hands first say dating apps","story":"How dating apps are adapting to love in the time of coronavirusDating apps are adapting to love in the time of coronavirus, warning their users of the elevated risks of going on dates while trying to ensure they do not switch off entirely when the time comes to self-isolate.OKCupid, which prides itself on its data-led approach to dating, asking users to fill in detailed questionnaires and matching them with others who give similar answers, has sent a push alert to every user asking them an additional question: “Does coronavirus affect your dating life?”Other dating apps have taken a softer approach, at least for the time being.

Behind its self-deprecating title, his 2017 autobiography Let’s Make Lots of Money: Secrets of a Fat, Rich, Gay Lucky Bastard is a hilariously self-aggrandising read. In its opening couple of pages alone, he describes himself as “a self-made, man-mad man”, “a living legend” and “one of the last pop moguls … a dying breed, the kind that did it in style”.Certainly, he was a manager in a grand British pop tradition that stretched back to Larry Parnes and Brian Epstein. Like them, he was a gay man who felt he implicitly understood what pop’s primary market of teenage girls wanted: he explained his thinking behind 90s boyband East 17 with the words “we all like a bit of rough”. He was cultured – a trained designer with a fondness for the Bauhaus movement and a background working for Terence Conran, Watkins was rather more of an aesthete than his brash public image suggested – and nearly as well-known as the artists he ostensibly worked for. Indeed, Watkins was so enamoured of said tradition that he occasionally attempted to pass himself off as Jewish, one attribute he didn’t share with its founding fathers.His earliest forays into management involved transforming two south London pub bands into would-be glam rock stars Ice Cream and Giggles. In the long run, their abject commercial failure turned out to be their selling-point – decades after their release, both Ice Cream’s solitary single Shout It Out and Giggles’ Glad to Be Alive and Just Another Saturday Night became hugely collectable examples of junk shop glam, a subgenre predicated on the bands’ initial obscurity. But while attempting to hustle them to the top, Watkins established his standard managerial style: ruthlessly dictatorial about everything from his artists’ sound to their appearance to their logos. By his own admission a frustrated pop star, Watkins saw himself as a svengali rather than a mere music industry deal-maker.The failure of Ice Cream and Giggles, as well as a soft rockfunk band called Grand Hotel, caused Watkins to return to design. When his company XL was employed to design sleeves and adverts for the new ZTT label, he noted with approval the degree of control the label’s in-house producer Trevor Horn and marketing and promotions guru Paul Morley exerted over their biggest act, Frankie Goes to Hollywood. That Frankie had become the UK’s biggest pop sensation of 1984 seemed to confirm that Watkins’ way of thinking yielded results, although his attempt to achieve something similar with a hopelessly limp, Stock, Aitken and Waterman-produced trio called Spelt Like This came to nothing.Ironically, Watkins’ first success as a manager came with a band implacably resistant to his domineering style. He had initially met Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys when borrowing a Spider-Man costume for Giggles’ stage act from Marvel comics, then Tennant’s employer. Impressed by the songs Tennant had authored with Chris Lowe, he accepted their offer to manage them – the duo were impressed by his connections to Frankie Goes to Hollywood – but also noted that the pair were smarter than him. He secured them a deal with Parlophone but found his suggestions about their music and image went largely unheeded. They parted company at the height of the Pet Shop Boys’ success.His next project, however, was more Watkins’ style. He gave Bros their name, designed their logo and radically overhauled their image, sending them to the era’s hippest London hair salon Cuts and dressing them in clothes you would have seen at an illegal warehouse party. He co-wrote every song on their debut album Push under a pseudonym, the Brothers, designed to fool audiences into thinking Matt and Luke Goss had done it themselves. Bros were a smash hit – Push sold 10m copies and spawned five Top 5 singles – but the great flaw in Watkins’ managerial process was swiftly revealed: even manufactured pop artists were disinclined to, as he put it, “put up, shut up and mime” once they had achieved vast success.A brief attempt to manage post-acid house electronic band Electribe 101 left Watkins convinced he should stick to mainstream pop. He built a band around a young songwriter called Tony Mortimer. A “bad boy” counterpart to the more parent-friendly Take That, East 17 went onto become vastly successful: among their singles lurked a cover of the Pet Shop Boys’ West End Girls, suggested by Watkins primarily in an attempt to irritate his former charges. Their career abruptly came to a halt when the band’s loosest cannon, Brain Harvey, announced during a 1997 radio interview that he’d taken 12 ecstasy tablets in a night. A gleeful hedonist himself, Watkins thought that Harvey was exaggerating – “You can’t take 13 Es in a night,” he offered, “your cock would be dropping off” – and that the ensuing furore, which quickly spiralled to the point that the then-prime minister John Major became involved, was hypocritical. Perhaps that was why he seemed incapable of containing the damage: Harvey was fired, and East 17 collapsed shortly afterwards.Their demise marked the end of Watkins’ reign in the music industry. Some of his subsequent ideas were intriguing and ahead of their time – an openly gay boyband called 2wo Third3, a pre-Gorillaz cartoon pop star called Kulkarni – but none of them stuck. He came closest with North and South, a boyband launched via a children’s BBC show (an idea subsequently reused to far greater effect by Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller with S Club 7), but was retired by the turn of the millennium, retreating to the south coast, where he designed and built an award-winning, Bauhaus-inspired home and opened a restaurant. He professed himself horrified by the impact of TV talent shows on pop, making the point that while his autocratic style had paved way for Simon Cowell, at least he’d chosen interesting or quirky figures to impose his will on.You could spot his affection for a different era by the way his autobiography repeatedly used the kind of terms once common in the pages of Smash Hits, such as “down the dumper” and “the giddy carousel of pop”. The man who’d coined both of them, Neil Tennant, paid a kind of tribute to Watkins in the Pet Shop Boys’ musical Closer to Heaven: the character of Bob Saunders, a brazen loudmouth manager required to sing the words: “I have to admit, I’m an absolute shit”, bore a suspicious resemblance to him. It says something about Tom Watkins that he professed himself absolutely delighted: whatever you thought of his managerial approach and his influence on pop, you could never have accused him of taking himself too seriously."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e668b0b7f2afdd4cb81795a44f6fde7fff6c5f2a/1348_571_2219_1331/master/2219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6498c8a6c8e7ef4fab1495a501f5991a","title":"hadley freeman search uncover family secrets podcast","story":"When Hadley Freeman found an old shoebox full of pictures and documents in the back of a wardrobe, it began a quest to find the real story of her family’s history and her grandmother’s escape to America from the Nazis.

We take a closer look at the well-known investment safe havenGold is the original precious metal. It is rich in symbolism but it’s also rich in function. Over millennia, it has been used for coins, jewellery, ornamentation, medals, electronic components, the basis of monetary systems and the titles of countless James Bond films. But, recently, people have been reminded of its historic use as a comparatively safe store of value.The bank was explaining why it still kept gold reserves. But during these times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, its words sparked media discussions about investors buying up gold in a flight to financial safety.Unlike cash, the value of gold isn’t eroded by inflation. It is highly fungible and can easily be converted into hard currency wherever you are in the world. In extreme cases, such as in war-torn countries, if you lose everything else, you can carry a couple of small gold bars out with you. It also has a great heritage and global branding given that people have historically relied on it during times of political turmoil. “For thousands of years gold has been a store of value,” says Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, the online consumer investing platform.In recent months, the value of gold has increased amid concerns about the global economy and the spectre of a full-scale trade war between the US and China. The price of gold hit £1,278 an ounce last September as large numbers of investors bought into the precious metal during something of a rush to so-called “safe-haven” assets. These are lower-risk assets that are expected to retain their value or even grow in value when other assets fall – thereby helping investors to limit their exposure to losses. “You want assets that perform when the stock market doesn’t,” says Lowcock.Other safe-haven investments include defensive stocks that are less vulnerable to economic downturns, such as utility companies, supermarkets and other businesses that provide everyday essentials. Likewise, bonds usually offer more predictable returns than shares, and certain currencies such as the Yen and Swiss Franc are also seen as safe-haven investments.But while gold arguably remains the best-known financial safe haven, its safety as an investment largely depends on what you’re looking for.One of gold’s chief disadvantages as an investment is that it doesn’t provide you with an income. It pays no interest or idends, unlike shares or cash on deposit. The only money you make on gold is capital appreciation when the price goes up. However, in an economic environment where interest rates are very low (and bond yields are also very low), a lack of income from gold may not be that much of an issue.A bigger problem perhaps is that gold prices can and do fluctuate – and often considerably. In Davos, in 2010, George Soros famously said: “When interest rates are low we have conditions for asset bubbles to develop, and they are developing at the moment. The ultimate asset bubble is gold.”It’s also worth remembering that all safe-haven investments have potential downsides. Indeed, the only safe haven that can’t lose you money is cash – although it can lose you value in high inflation environments and it generally provides a poor return in low inflation environments such as the one we’re currently in.Of course, economic fundamentals aside, centuries of symbolism mean that gold’s emotional and psychological value is unlikely to fade any time soon. And as our faith in our financial system is continually tested, perhaps it will one day come to symbolise the important value of safety as much as wealth.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

And these devices are already proving their worthWho hasn’t found their attention straying behind the wheel? Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention – whether it’s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts.This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it’s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it’s about cars that can take control when you have lost it.The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. “ADAS has been a step change,” says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University’s Transport Safety Research Centre. “There was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.”Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its “second pair of eyes”, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians.Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS:As with all the company’s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly.EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared “Best in Class 2019 in the Small Off-roadMPV Class”.Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver’s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru’s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it “the most advanced of its kind”. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems.Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision.While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation – like the law banning handling a mobile phone – can only go so far.Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law and are likely to be adopted in the UK – specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed “Vision Zero”, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries.But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology?“It’s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,” admits Morris. “However it’s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.”Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

In his critically acclaimed one-man show, The Misfit Analysis, which premiered at the 2015 Edinburgh festival, he also challenged preconceptions about the autistic mind.He is currently starring in unReal City at Battersea Arts Centre in south London, in a virtual reality show he co-devised about life in a digital world. Binchy is also about to take on the role of part-time digital influencer at Access All Areas, a theatre company that puts on productions made by learning-disabled and autistic artists.He wants to reach more people so they understand the talent of performers like himself. “Social media can be really bad for people with learning disabilities or autism. It’s easy to hide behind a keyboard and bully other people. It’s also not real life … You can have a virtual home in a virtual world with a virtual social life, but we need people to have real lives in the real world, and real opportunities,” says Binchy.Binchy says: “You need to see yourself up there in order to be more confident and know that you’re also included in society. There are so many amazing performers with learning disability and autism out there who deserve an opportunity to show what they can do.”He wants to see more inclusive arts charities like Access All Areas set up. “The problem is that people often think that the only kind of theatre that neuroerse people can do is a tiny performance in a church hall … people see it and say ‘Ah, that’s nice they’re doing well’. But we don’t just want to get out of the house – we want a purpose in life and we need to earn money just like anyone else. When I earn money, I can make a better living for myself, I’m doing something I love and it’s being taken seriously.”Binchy is driven by the need to express himself “and wanting to show I’m doing something that I’m good at and have a talent for”.Binchy says people assume “we’re all just victims or vulnerable”. He adds: “We can be good, we can be bad. We can be funny.” How does he describe his disability? “I have emotional issues and I’m autistic. I’d also say that I sometimes struggle with mental health. But people want to put you in a box just called ‘autism’ – even if they don’t mean any harm, it’s not as simple as that. I don’t like being labelled.”Other challenges include society’s presumption that “people like us” are asexual. “I remember talking to someone who said ‘That’s nice’ when I introduced my girlfriend. That was so patronising. Why can’t someone like me be in a relationship?” When he toured the Midlands with his one-man show, a B\u0026ampB landlady spoke to his non-disabled colleague, not to him. He says: “She talked about me, not even looking at me. It made me feel terrible and like a child.” The actor also worries welfare reform is undermining people’s support. “I’m on universal credit – don’t get me started on that, it’s been a nightmare. It is so complicated and it’s hurting a lot of people.”Binchy says it is important that neuroerse performers don’t compare themselves with other disabled artists. “Everyone is an inidual,” he says. “We all have different talents and what you do will be unique.”Family: Single, one brother.Education: Springhallow secondary school, Ealing Acton College (BTec drama, Gatehouse – a transitional programme for autistic learners) Hammersmith College (life skills) Royal Central School of Speech and Drama (performance-making diploma).Public life: Public speaker at the 2015 Autism and Comedy Symposium at the University of Kent Ambitious About Autism eventsand at the Houses of Parliament launch of the NHS autismlearning disability initiative Ask Listen Do.Awards and honours: 2016: People’s Choice award for The Misfit Analysis at the Vault festival, London.Interests: Writing poetry, listening to music, swimming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6c7c2349c14906b812761baf699f4b88ac7cd9a/0_0_4303_2582/master/4303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31a3ff841bf3ea25888f4fcf28313eae","title":"feminist solidarity empowers everyone the movement must be trans inclusive","story":"Taking the side of the oppressed has long been feminism’s raison d’etre. Amid an explosion of misogyny in public life, compassion and unity are more important than everI have written nothing on trans issues for seven years. A now-familiar row had broken out in the feminist movement back then, and I assumed that feminism would soon re-orient itself away from which body parts define a woman and whether or not the word “womxn” signified an assault on our sense of selves, and towards what I thought was obviously the more fundamental question of the movement: who has it worse? Feminism, in my life’s experience of it, takes the side of the oppressed. That is our raison d’etre.So, anyway, I had seen this wonderful talk by Helen Belcher, who described the three ways in which trans people are portrayed and undermined, in the media and beyond. “The first is that they’re fraudulent. They’re not really who they say they are. We’d better humour them in their delusion. The second is trans as undeserving deviant. The third is trans as comedy.” Since then, this has intensified, with other, even more hostile, elements added: trans people as predators, the trans movement as deliberately poisoning the young. The savage mischief has seeped out of it. There is not much of the “We’d better humour them” any more.Even in 2013, though, it was clear that trans people were in the eye of a familiar set of prejudices, which any of us – gay, female, disabled, BAME – might recognise. The difference was that people had become much less likely than they once were to laugh openly at those with disabilities, or to raise an eyebrow when two men kissed or an upstart woman demanded a fundamental human right. As a cause matures, it gets to the point where everyone recognises that their inidual view no longer matters. But all that prejudice did not just evaporate, and the very idea of a trans person became its great release. All this pent up feeling exploded on to this one group, who – to put it mildly – could have done without it. It was, and remains, obvious which side feminism would be expected to take in this fight: the side of compassion and fellowship. We would recognise the importance of being an ally in a battle that we had been through.Seven years ago, I thought this was quite an emollient argument, having gone nowhere near definitions, biology or absolutes – a call to rejoice in everything that made the women’s movement meaningful and victorious: strength in numbers, solidarity and, ultimately, love.That is not how it played out. Women on the other side of this row were apoplectic, because if you celebrate compassion without explicitly agreeing with them, they would argue that you are calling them uncompassionate. I thought: I am never going anywhere near this again, which was cowardly I regret it.But I recall that not as a humble-brag-style apology, but because there is a bizarre idea ossifying that “real” feminists are being hounded out of the discursive space by trans activists. Rather, what has occurred is the systematic enclosure of the debate, so that unless you want to go to the mats about toilets, your point of view is not relevant.All kinds of voices have been excluded. The experience of trans men, for instance, has been more or less erased, because the core issues have been whittled down to such a sharp, conflicted point – do cis women need protected status? – that the very existence of trans men has become too inconvenient to accommodate. The mainstream feminist view, which is trans-inclusive, has been sidelined to maintain the fiction that this is a generational battle between old and young feminists. Again, it is tactical and convenient to portray trans inclusion as a Trojan horse that all the young idiots allow in, being unaware of the history of women’s rights. But it simply is not so. Just because you are middle aged does not mean you agree with Germaine Greer. On the flipside, it is convenient to find that your voice is not relevant to this debate, because the conflict runs so high. But that is not a sufficient response when the generosity of the movement is at stake.It is astonishing that the idea of the “women-only space” is being touted as a fundamental pillar of the movement, yet is completely stripped of the historical context of that. Women-only space was a realm protected from our Harvey Weinsteins, where we could talk about our Harvey Weinsteins it was not a hallowed place where we communicated through our ovaries. It was where we came together in unity against people who hated us. I can’t imagine the mindset that would exclude a trans sister from that.The fact is, in every backlash against every civil rights movement, there have been people saying: your emancipation is not possible for operational reasons. You can’t have the vote because your hands are too small. You can’t use the swimming pool because your hygiene is not the same . I find this egregious. What are we doing, trying to consecrate the public lavatory as a place so precious to the experience of womanhood that we have to be exclusive, rather than inclusive that we have to characterise ourselves as a set of vulnerabilities, rather than strengths?So much of the live combat happens on Twitter. This is not to call it irrelevant (I love Twitter), but might be cause to reflect. It really suits the “alt-right” to see feminist discourse mired in this. There is so much else we could be doing. The two major transnational grassroots movements of the recent past are the climate strikes and the women’s marches. Their combined energy – bearing in mind how much crossover there is in those communities – would be awesome.We are witnessing an explosion of misogyny at the highest levels of public life. We have seen explicitly misogynistic terrorist acts – indeed, hatred of women is the through line that connects Isis to incels, that unites acts of violence globally – all while state-sponsored oppression of women has ascended to new levels of impunity. We have never needed unity more, yet, by wild coincidence, at exactly this moment, suddenly there is this obstacle that we can’t get past.It feels distinctly modern and unprecedented that we find ourselves in this obliterative debate, where one side can’t prevail until the other is destroyed, where all the values of the movement are parked so we can fight over issues that are so technical that there is no room for compromise, yet also so abstract that there is no space for human beings.In fact, there is precedent: we have weathered absolutes before. Are all men rapists? (But what about my son?) Is all sex servitude? (What if it was my idea?) Is lesbianism a political act? (What if I hate politics and would prefer to have a sexual destiny like anyone else?) None of this was settled in science. There was no definitive treaty that we all signed. We just decided slowly that binary debates are interesting to have, but boring to live. Solidarity is boring to talk about, but fascinating and empowering to live. Solidarity is not exclusive or pedantic it is compassionate and fights oppression where it finds it. That is its lifeblood. That is why trans women are women, or womxn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/484e230d2f89e0d9c070e0a6c7c180196d10a694/0_60_4217_2530/master/4217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fcc43d128cbf7072af743fbdc31cc47","title":"epatante wins champion hurdle at cheltenham festival horse racing","story":"Two of jumping’s great survivors combined to devastating effect in the Champion Hurdle here on Tuesday as the mare Epatante gave Nicky Henderson his eighth win in the race, 35 years after the first, with the 40-year-old Barry Geraghty holding her reins. Epatante, too, had survived a scare after suffering from a cough at the weekend, but once racing she travelled effortlessly throughout and sealed the win with a quicksilver jump at the last.Cheltenham was not so much in a different era as a different world when See You Then won the first of three Champion Hurdles in 1985. Countless National Hunt training careers have waxed and waned since but Henderson is still at the summit of his sport, and here at the Festival above all: Epatante’s win, completing a double after Shishkin’s success in the opening race, took him back in front of Willie Mullins in the all-time list for Festival winners after falling one behind last year.Geraghty, meanwhile, has broken all four of his limbs at various stages in his 23-year riding career, and has said that his most recent broken leg, sustained in a shocking fall at Aintree’s Grand National meeting last year, was the worst of the lot. But the guarantee of big-race action that comes with his job as first jockey to JP McManus has so far pushed any serious thoughts about retirement to one side.Epatante could well be a horse to keep him in the saddle for a year or two yet. Any doubts about her ability to handle the track after a disappointing run when favourite for the Mares’ Novice Hurdle last year were dispelled and she won so comfortably that it is easy to imagine her becoming Henderson’s third multiple winner of this race, after See You Then and Buveur D’Air. She was strongly supported beforehand and set off as the 2-1 favourite, and some of her backers at least will be tempted to play up their winnings at the 5-1 available for next year’s Champion.McManus, who was celebrating his 69th birthday, has now seen his colours land this race a remarkable nine times, and six since 2010. Geraghty has now reached 39 Festival winners, second in the all-time list behind Ruby Walsh and top among current riders following the latter’s retirement last April, while Henderson’s status at the all-time top trainer survived for at least another day when two Mullins-trained odds-on favourites, Benie Des Dieux and Carefully Selected, both failed to justify their starting prices later on the card.Mullins also supplied the runner-up in the Champion Hurdle as Sharjah, ridden by his son Patrick, finished strongly on ground that was much slower than he prefers, while his stable companion, Cilaos Emery, ¬was sent off second-favourite but never threatened to take a hand in the closing stages on the way to a fourth-place finish.Mullins has more big chances on Wednesday’s card, including Chacun Pour Soi in the Champion Chase, from which Henderson was forced to scratch Altior on Tuesday due to lameness. But if it seemed 12 months ago that Mullins might clear away from Henderson in the all-time standings after edging in front, the great survivor clearly has other ideas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9592667167d3c653b7b1f7ed96d411d7defdf0a/0_155_3984_2391/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3712752cfbbdf796d403c5f658ce0359","title":"cheltenham festival 2020 champion hurdle day live horse racing","story":"The favourite proved her class to win the day’s feature race, while Rachael Blackmore and Honeysuckle prevailed in a two-horse battle in the Mares’ HurdleThat’s all from me for today, but I’ll be back tomorrow - and we’ll have another tipping competition up and running.

The hot favourite is Carefully Selected, unbeaten in three over fences but a bit chancy-looking at Naas last time. This is his toughest test yet and he needs to respond by jumping better, which is not how these things usually go. Ravenhill was beaten just a head in the Kerry National but his best form is on a much drier surface than this. Lord Du Mesnil loves the mud but it’s fair to ask how much more he has to offer this season after some hard races.

Richard Johnson will have to see the doctor before he can be cleared to race on Wednesday, after falling in the Arkle earlier on today.Richard Johnson will need to pass the doctor on Wednesday if he is to take his rides on day two of the Cheltenham Festival.The multiple champion jockey was partnering the Olly Murphy-trained Brewin’upastorm in Tuesday’s Arkle Challenge Trophy when he was unseated at the 10th fence. Johnson walked back into the weighing room, but was stood down from the remainder of his mounts.BHA spokesman Robin Mounsey said: “Richard Johnson was stood down for the day by the doctor. He will need to pass a medical examination in the morning to be able to take his rides.”Johnson only returned on action on February 27, having been out since January 21 after suffering a broken arm.

Galvin, sixth in the Ballymore last year, has been brought along steadily in non-handicaps and seems to have landed on a lenient rating. The handicap king, Gordon Elliott, appears to have saved him for this since November. Hold The Note didn’t do his rating any favours by finishing second in a Grade Two last time and he might be up against it now. Espoir De Guye was also raised significantly for his last run but, as he won a valuable Ascot handicap by 10 lengths, it’s only fair. He should have more to offer for Venetia Williams, seeking her first Festival win for seven years. Mitchouka is an interesting Irish raider at 25-1. He’s shown promise in two runs for a new yard and should improve for this return to longer.Bookies would have feared the worst after Epatante won the Champion Hurdle, but Honeysuckle - owned by bookmaker Kenny Alexander - saw off the favourite there. A great tactical race too, with Honeysuckle going inside to get beyond Stormy Ireland and get an advantage into the home straight.It was billed as the battle of the day, and it delivered, with Blackmore and Townend going toe-to-toe over the final fence and up the hill - but Honeysuckle holds on!

Benie Des Dieux starts 4-6 favourite ...Some news from the US, where Maximum Security’s trainer, Jason Servis, has been fired by the racehorse’s owner. Servis has been indicted over an alleged mass-doping scheme:This has been billed as a clash between two top-class mares but the market has decided which one it likes. Benie Des Dieux would be seeking a hat-trick in this, but for falling on her face at the last a year ago. She might just have been getting tired but it was her first start for 11 months. This time, she comes off a win in the Galmoy, when she left her rivals 21 lengths behind and prompted Mullins to suggest she was the best mare he had trained (look away now, Annie Power and Quevega). She is the right favourite but the improving Honeysuckle will surely be a tough opponent after winning the Irish Champion at half a mile shorter last time. The rest have work to do, including Roksana, last year’s winner, who seems regressive this season. Stormy Ireland, second last year, is going the right way and it is not impossible to imagine her getting involved.That win also moves Nicky Henderson past Willie Mullins, and back into the overall lead as Cheltenham’s most successful trainer with 66 wins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/278de65f0b3837467e11bd8b856563ac286f29a0/0_359_5388_3233/master/5388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=302233889b5c0805467cbb66212dcb55","title":"elon musk college for fun not learning","story":"Tesla chief told audience member at conference that college was unnecessary despite many SpaceX job postings requiring a degreeTesla billionaire Elon Musk thinks people “don’t need college to learn stuff” and says jobs at his companies should not require a degree.“Did Shakespeare go to college?” he asked. “Probably not.”At the Satellite 2020 conference in Washington DC on Monday, an audience member told Musk she noticed that many job postings at his company SpaceX require a bachelor’s degree and say a master’s degree is preferred – despite Musk having been vocal about not requiring a college degree for jobs at his companies.“With more jobs asking for higher levels of degrees,” the audience member said, “scholarships are not changing amounts and it’s getting harder and harder every year to pay tuition, even with using scholarships. How can college and industries make it easier to afford college?”Musk, whose net worth is estimated at $34bn, responded by saying that college was unnecessary because “you can learn anything you want for free”.The main value of college, he said, is to be found in proving discipline by completing “annoying homework assignments” and in hanging around with people of the same age before entering the workforce.“I think college is basically for fun and to prove that you can do your chores, but they’re not for learning,” Musk said.He also said he hopes to make sure his electric car company Tesla does not have university requirements for jobs, “because that’s absurd”. The main requirement for employment at his companies, he said, is “exceptional ability”.“I don’t consider going to college evidence of exceptional ability,” Musk said. “In fact, ideally you dropped out.”Musk listed some “smart guys” who dropped out of college: Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison. He also made his reference to Shakespeare, in fact the son of a glover who received a grammar school education but no more.When it comes to college dropouts, the three tech moguls cited by Musk are the exception not the rule. In the US, on average, a college degree brings $30,000 more in salary each year than a high school education.Musk in fact has two bachelors degrees, having attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated from the Wharton School – Donald Trump’s alma mater – in 1997.He did manage to drop out of his PhD program at Stanford, after two days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0423aab395e588566738a55caff1665d0c06d2a/0_0_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859c5cd1b667f5bf12ceb9a64db043e3","title":"tell us how is coronavirus affecting your day to day life","story":"We want to hear about how coronavirus has impacted your daily life.

Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unusually for a virus that has made the jump from one species to another, it appears to transmit effectively in humans – current estimates show that without strong containment measures the average person who catches Covid-19 will pass it on to two others. The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu. The combination of coronavirus’s ability to spread and cause serious illness has prompted many countries, including the UK, to introduce or plan extensive public health measures aimed at containing and limiting the impact of the epidemic.Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and do this often, including when you get home or into work. Use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your face. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your elbow (not your hand) and put used tissues straight in the bin. Avoid close contact with people who are showing possible symptoms. Follow NHS guidance on self-isolation and travel.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.The coronavirus outbreak hit amid flu season in the northern hemisphere and even doctors can struggle to distinguish between the two – the overlap in symptoms probably contributed to slow detection of community infections in some countries, including Italy.If you have symptoms or think you might have been exposed to the virus when travelling or through other contacts, call the NHS 111 service or visit the online service, or contact the equivalent service in your country. Do not go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital.Most infections happen in families, where people live at close quarters. You need to be within one to two metres of somebody to be infected by viral-loaded water droplets from their coughs or when they are speaking. That is less likely on public transport. However, it would be possible to pick up the virus on your hands from a surface that somebody with the infection had touched. The virus can linger for 48 hours or even possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, such as the hand rail in the tube – though less time on a soft surface. That is why the advice is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face, to prevent the virus getting into your nose, mouth or eyes.Not at the moment, but drugs that are known to work against some viruses are being trialled in China, where there are thousands of patients, and new trials are starting in the US and other countries. Large numbers are needed to find out whether they work in a few people or a lot of people or nobody at all. The most hopeful are Kaletra, which is a combination of two anti-HIV drugs, and remdesivir, which was tried but failed in Ebola patients in west Africa in 2013 and 2016. Some Chinese doctors are also trying chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, which is off-patent, therefore cheap and highly available, and would be very useful in low-income countries. The first results are expected in mid-March and should indicate if the drugs will at least help those who are most severely ill. A miracle cure is not expected.Efforts to develop an effective vaccine for Covid-19 have been quick compared with historical epidemics, such as Ebola. A number of teams are already testing vaccine candidates in animals and preparing to carry out small trials in people. The US company, Moderna Therapeutics, is already recruiting and hopes to enrol 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 and launch the trial by the end of April. Phase one trials like this look at whether the vaccine triggers an immune response and whether the given dose causes adverse effects and could be completed quite quickly. However, the subsequent phases, which will involve thousands of volunteers and will look more closely at efficacy, will take longer and obtaining a commercially available vaccine within a year would be extremely quick. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he did not think a working vaccine to protect people from the coronavirus would be produced in time for the current outbreak, but that a timeframe of a year or 18 months “was not unreasonable to assume”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 2","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak:In all, 4,090 people have died as a result of the outbreak and 116,558 have been infected, according to figures compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

Outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people, and indoor events with more than 100, were also banned.Spain, which reported 35 deaths and 1,622 confirmed cases on Tuesday, shut schools in several regions, including the capital, Madrid suspended flights from Italy and closed the lower house of parliament for at least a week after an MP tested positive.In Germany, which has 1,295 coronavirus patients and where two people have died, Berlin authorities announced the closure of all theatres, concert halls and opera houses until at least the end of the Easter holidays. The capital also became the seventh of Germany’s 16 states to ban gatherings of 1,000 people or more.Greece, which has 89 confirmed cases, announced the nationwide closure of schools and universities Poland, which has reported 17 infections and no deaths, cancelled all mass events and the Czech Republic, with 40 cases, closed schools indefinitely and has banned all events involving more than 100 people.Denmark blocked all air traffic from the hardest hit countries Romania and Slovenia banned gatherings of more than 1,000 and 100 people respectively Ireland cancelled St Patrick’s Day parades and Belgium’s prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, recommended indoor events with more than 1,000 people be postponed and told people to work from home if possible.In other developments:On Monday night Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced that the entire country would be covered by restrictions that “can be summarised as follows: I stay at home”, with all travel banned unless justified on professional or health grounds.Ministers said on Tuesday that Italians could get a “holiday” from mortgage payments under a raft of measures to ease the economic blow from the lockdown.The EU praised Italy’s “very courageous measures” on Tuesday and pledged to do all in its power to help. Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commission’s executive vice-president, said the steps would “put a great strain on the Italian people, but it’s better to take them now to protect as many as possible”.The total of 10,149 cases in the country (which include 631 deaths and 1,004 people who have since recovered) amount to the biggest outbreak after China. The country’s Patient 1 – the first to be diagnosed with the illness – was now breathing on his own again, officials said on Monday.In France, President Emmanuel Macron said the country was “only at the beginning of this epidemic”, as authorities confirmed there had been 30 deaths and 1,606 confirmed infections.The country has already banned all gatherings of more than 1,000 people, but with only a fraction of the number of deaths reported in Italy, it has thus far held off from introducing the draconian measures ordered by Rome.In the US, Donald Trump is expected to announced measures to protect the economy. There was alarm in Washington after at least two Republican politicians who had recently met the president announced they were going into self-quarantine after potentially being exposed to the virus at a conference. The US has so far reported 26 deaths and 605 confirmed infections.Chinese authorities said 19 new cases had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, the lowest total since 20 January. President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the centre of the epidemic, on Tuesday, seemingly eager to demonstrate how the quarantine measures that are still largely in place were paying off.China has registered a total of 80,754 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 3,136 deaths. But as authorities continued to record a slowdown in new cases, the last of 14 makeshift hospitals that were opened during the past six weeks was closed, and restrictions beyond Hubei province were easing, with people returning to work, and factories and some schools reopening.Progress was also reported in South Korea, with authorities on Tuesday declaring 131 new infections, the lowest figure for a fortnight, taking the total to 7,513. Three more deaths took the country’s death toll to 54.Yoon Tae-ho, of South Korea’s central disaster management headquarters, said the rate of increase was “coming to a standstill” but that the virus was still spreading, and advised against any relaxation of containment efforts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c105c6ee4159064c2468358128c985d7b5be456e/0_52_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=178df4345af844fd670f358b2c045957","title":"pressure builds on uk to step up coronavirus measures","story":"Travellers returning to UK from Italy told no need to isolate as sixth death announcedNo 10 has admitted the NHS 111 online service has been giving out the wrong advice on coronavirus to travellers returning from Italy, as the number of confirmed cases in the UK rose to 373 and a sixth death was announced.Returning travellers from the European centre of the outbreak in Italy were still being told all day on Tuesday there was no need to self-isolate if they had no symptoms.This is despite advice from Public Health England released on Monday night advising all people coming from Italy, which is in lockdown, to stay at home for 14 days regardless of whether they feel unwell.Confused travellers expressed their concerns about the conflicting advice on social media but NHS 111 still had not updated the portal at 5pm on Tuesday – hours after it was first informed of the problem.No 10 defended the government’s handling of its advice to citizens, saying: “They are aware of the problem and that information is being urgently updated. Obviously, we have been setting out very clearly in public what the advice is in relation to Italy. But I am aware of the issue and it is being urgently resolved.”Elisabeth Braw, a resilience expert at the Royal United Services (RUSI) thinktank, said: “It’s really in everybody’s interests that all of the government channels for information says the same thing. Otherwise there may be confusion.“But really there a fundamental problem in that the UK has not focused on preparedness among the public. The government may consider itself to be prepared but it’s not the case that the public is. Otherwise you end up with frantic last-minute efforts and the public are stockpiling toilet paper and other resources.”A sizeable proportion of the UK’s 373 coronavirus cases have originated in Italy, with thousands of people returning from holidays in the country in recent weeks.Ryanair has followed British Airways and other airlines in reducing the number of flights to and from the country.The government said those arriving at Heathrow from Italy who were not easily able to self-isolate were being asked if they wanted to enter quarantine at a large hotel near the airport.The venue is understood to be a Holiday Inn that has been used for some people arriving from China and South Korea in recent weeks. No 10 said some people thought to be at particular risk were being offered transport to their homes.However, people returning from Italy were not given information on self-isolation as they landed and were largely free to travel home via public transport if they wished, even though they were supposed to self-isolate for 14 days even if they did not have symptoms.It is not known whether they were being offered face masks for the journey and it was also unclear what the procedures were for people returning via other airports.European states have been announcing increasingly strict measures to try to stem the spread of the virus. Austria announced a ban on Italians entering the country unless they were carrying a medical certificate, while Spain has said it is preparing for school closures from Wednesday.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection.

The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.The sixth death happened on Monday night at Watford General hospital, part of West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS trust. The patient was in their 80s and had underlying health conditions.On Tuesday, MPs were told the government could suspend various elements of bureaucracy for GPs to allow them to focus more immediately on treating patients.In other developments on Tuesday:Earlier on Tuesday, the deputy chief medical officer for England defended the government’s strategy of holding off on cancelling major outdoor events such as football matches and closing schools.Speaking as tens of thousands of people attended the opening day of the Cheltenham festival, Dr Jenny Harries said the argument for cancelling major events was not necessarily supported by science, adding: “The virus will not survive very long outside.”New measures including those aimed at protecting older or vulnerable people are expected to be put into action soon, possibly after a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee on Wednesday.Boris Johnson discussed the situation with England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, on Tuesday morning, while experts from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) convened to analyse the latest figures on spread. Among those calling for a change of tactics soon was Dr Peter Drobac, an expert in infectious diseases at Oxford University, who told the BBC he believed it was time to seriously consider some of the social distancing adopted by other countries, including closing schools.“The evidence we have suggests that social distancing works best before the surge in cases rather than after,” said Drobac, adding that with hindsight it appeared Italy had waited too long before implementing such measures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc6e7e72f7eddfa56e93d82bf4edf46d409fe0b/0_0_5485_3290/master/5485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f808a6dab84f8723f1c4f368fa94b5b","title":"us taliban deal frank mckenzie afghanistan","story":"Marine Gen Frank McKenzie gave evidence to Congress on Tuesday, hours after US forces began pulling out of AfghanistanThe US commander for the Middle East and Afghanistan has said the Taliban are not keeping “their part of the bargain” from the deal signed with the US earlier this month, saying the insurgents were continuing to launch attacks.Marine Gen Frank McKenzie was giving evidence to Congress on Tuesday, hours after US forces began pulling out of Afghanistan as agreed in the 29 February deal, and as talks between Taliban and government representatives were due to begin.“The Taliban need to keep their part of the bargain, and they are continuing attacks,” McKenzie, the head of US Central Command, said. “They are not directed against coalition forces, they are not occurring in city centers, they are occurring at isolated checkpoints. But those attacks are occurring, and they’re not consistent with a movement toward a negotiated settlement, and they’re not consistent with the undertaking they made.”The US-Taliban deal followed a week-long partial ceasefire, but it did not include an agreement to continue that ceasefire. Trump administration officials have said that the withdrawal of the 13,000-strong US military presence in Afghanistan, due to happen over 14 months, would be “conditions-based”.“We’re going to go to 8,600 by the summer,” McKenzie said. “Conditions on the ground will dictate if we go below that. If conditions on the ground are not permissive, my advice would not to be to continue that reduction.”US officials have not spelled out the conditions for the US withdrawal to continue, leaving the Trump administration much room for manoeuvre in interpreting success.A secret annexe to the agreement signed in Doha reportedly lists the sort of attacks that are prohibited during that period, including assaults on the retreating US troops. The annexe has been shown to members of Congress but not to the public.In a highly sceptical assessment of the agreement, McKenzie told a House committee he was not optimistic about the Taliban severing ties with al-Qaida.“We need to observe what they do and we have the capability to do that … That has not yet been demonstrated,” he said.But, the general added: “We’re going to have ample time to see if they actually do that … And that will be before we become irrevocably committed to a force presence that would not allow us to have adequate leverage.”The chief Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, later presented a rosier assessment of the Taliban compliance with the Doha agreement.“Although there are ups and downs, it has somewhat been holding,” Hoffman said.Prospective talks between Taliban and government representatives, due to start this week, have been complicated over a continuing dispute over the result of last year’s presidential election and disagreement over a prisoner exchange.The swap involving up to 5,000 Taliban fighters was agreed by the US, which does not hold Taliban prisoners. They are being held by the Afghan government, which has been reluctant to free prisoners of war before negotiations begin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dea0acc27703786cc53a64a199680edd849cb1c7/0_51_4110_2466/master/4110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d87f5f1ad92e013d5d6e14b596225f66","title":"vladimir putin amendment power russia 2024","story":"Current term limit for Putin, who has ruled for 20 years, expires in 2024Vladimir Putin has moved to cement his hold on power in Russia beyond the middle of the decade, backing a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow him to seek another two terms in the Kremlin.The Russian president is required by the constitution to step down in 2024, and there have been months of conjecture about how he could stay in power beyond then, or at least ensure a safe transition for himself.In the end, the puzzle was resolved in an afternoon, in a series of choreographed political steps that took just over three hours and could result in Putin staying on as president until 2036.The venture began in parliament, where a member of Russia’s ruling party proposed amending the constitution in a way that would “reset” Putin’s presidential term count back to zero.Putin then announced he would come to address the parliament himself, prompting breathless coverage on state television about whether he would accept or turn down the proposal. “In principle, this option would be possible,” he said at the end of a half-hour speech. “But on one condition – if the constitutional court gives an official ruling that such an amendment would not contradict the principles and main provisions of the constitution.”He also said the move would have to be approved by the public in a referendum next month.It was a significant, if not surprising, about-face for the president, who has been signalling publicly in recent months that he could leave the presidency. In January, he told a veteran of the second world war that he was worried about a return to the 80s, when Kremlin leaders “stayed in power until the end of their days” and did not provide for a transition of power.On Tuesday, he walked back that statement, saying that modern Russia’s elections made it impossible to return to a Soviet-style procession of leaders-for-life. “I won’t hide that I was wrong,” he said. “It was an incorrect statement because during the Soviet Union there were no elections.”Boris Yeltsin sacks his cabinet and appoints Putin, a political neophyte who headed the main successor to the KGB, as his acting prime minister and heir apparent.Yeltsin stuns Russia and the world by using his traditional new year message to announce his resignation and hand his sweeping powers, including the nuclear suitcase, to Putin.Putin is prevented by the constitution from running for a third term as president. The First deputy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is elected in his stead. One of his earliest moves is to appoint Putin as prime minister, leaving little doubt that the two men plan, at the very least, to run Russia in tandem.Ironically, the amendment piggybacks on plans to change the constitution to prevent anyone from serving more than two terms as president in total. The amendment says that the new rule would not count any presidential terms already served. In reality, the amendment affects only two living Russians, Putin and the former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev.Russia’s opposition, including Putin’s most prominent critic, Alexei Navalny, denounced the proposals as an effort to make him “president for life”. “Interesting how things turn out,” Navalny said in a tweet after Putin’s speech.Supporters of Putin said the amendment would prevent instability and avoid his being made a lame duck in his last term. “No one is saying that the amendments being proposed today are for Vladimir Putin,” said Alexander Khinshtein, a member of the ruling United Russia party, on state television. He also noted that Putin had not said he would necessarily run in 2024. “But the head of state should have that ability to maintain stability in society.”Valentina Tereshkova, an MP who as a Soviet cosmonaut became the first woman to fly to space, proposed the amendment as part of a series of constitutional changes going to a nationwide vote on 22 April.With Putin’s backing, there is little doubt the measure will pass. Support from the constitutional court is likely to be a rubber stamp. Less than an hour after Putin’s address to lawmakers, parliament approved the amendment as part of a wider revision of Russia’s constitution.The 67-year-old, in power for 20 years, is Russia’s longest-serving leader since Stalin. If he serves out both terms from 2024 he will surpass the Soviet dictator.The decision comes after a months-long effort to revise Russia’s constitution announced in January by Putin. Before Tuesday, some observers believed he was seeking another seat in government to maintain power and ensure his personal safety after leaving the presidency.It is unclear whether Putin had planned to stay on as president all along or had come to the decision more recently.In his speech, he said he hoped that one day the institution of the presidency in Russia would not be “so personified in a single person”, but added: “that is how all of our history ended up and of course we can’t not take that into account”.On the subject of whether he would actually run again in 2024, Putin told lawmakers: “I’m sure that we will do many great things together, at least before 2024. Then we’ll see.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/356521ba626070175b07c8486da13853078148da/0_171_5104_3062/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d89f2a4d3a7448dadb4b6f7de81b7f41","title":"were a bit shocked italians on life under coronavirus lockdown","story":"From Milan to Palermo in Sicily, few people are even venturing out for a coffee in the local barBar Il Sant’Andrea is something of a barometer for the liveliness of Orvieto, a hilltop town of about 4,000 people in Italy’s central Umbria region. On a typical morning, it would be buzzing with customers having coffee, chatting or reading the newspapers.On Tuesday, however, as news that the whole of Italy was to be put under lockdown sunk in, only a handful of regulars called in. “Think about it this way,” said the barman, Francesco Maggi. “On Sunday, five of us were working. Today, there is only one.”The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told 60 million Italians late on Monday to “stay at home” as the government introduced measures unprecedented in peacetime to contain Europe’s worst outbreak of the coronavirus.Conte’s message is starting to reverberate. The hashtag #iostoacasa – I stay at home - accompanied by images of home-cooked meals or a good book, has been shared by thousands on social media.In Orvieto, a town heavily dependent on tourism, bars and shops were already laying down duct tape to ensure customers stand at least a metre apart before Monday night’s announcement.The mood on Tuesday morning was sombre but, unlike in other places across Italy, there was no sense of panic. People were walking around, some wearing masks or with scarves wrapped around their mouths. “People are definitely taking it more seriously,” said Federico Badia, a shoemaker. “They are staying home and only going out if necessary. But I am very worried about the future of a little town like Orvieto, as most of the businesses survive on tourism. If the season doesn’t start in a month or so, I don’t think we’ll be having a season at all.”Other inhabitants were perplexed by the quarantine rules. “It is very confusing,” said Toni DeBella, a US resident. “You have to stay home, but you can go to a bar. Transportation is running, but you’re not supposed to go anywhere.”Under the quarantine regulations all forms of public gathering, include sporting events, have been banned, as have weddings and funerals. Theatres, cinemas, museums, gyms, spas and ski resorts have been closed. Only bars and restaurants can open, but only between 6am and 6pm. Travel is to be avoided unless it is for “urgent, verifiable work situations and emergencies health reasons”.“This is not an armoured shutdown like in China,” said Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister and the leader of Italia Viva, one of the parties that makes up the government majority. “There is space for movement for people who have urgent needs. We need to reduce the contagion to a minimum, not only because of the death rate but also because the impact on the health system is colossal. Intensive care units are filling up and if you have a stroke or heart attack, you can’t be treated.”Life in major cities, including Rome, Milan and Venice, has come to a standstill. “You can really see the difference in Rome today compared to yesterday,” said Sabina Colombo, a consultant who works from home. “It is very quiet. If I go out I wear plastic gloves, I couldn’t find a face mask anywhere.“In this type of situation there has to be a sense of civic responsibility and punishments for people who don’t respect the rules … those who do break them don’t care about the elderly dying, or those with cancer and low immunity.”Kelly Medford, a US artist living in Rome, said: “There has definitely been a change of mood over the last 24 hours. I think we’re all a little bit shocked as it really hits home just how dire the situation is.”In southern Italy, the region of Campania had the highest number of coronavirus cases as of Monday with 126, followed by Sicily with 60. Shortly after news of the lockdown broke, hundreds of people poured into one of the few supermarkets in the Sicilian capital of Palermo that is open 24 hours.By Tuesday morning, the streets of the city were mostly silent, apart from the hubbub at supermarkets and chemists as people joined long queues to buy essentials such as water, pasta and disinfectant.Stress, confusion and anxiety about the virus and the new rules was palpable. “I wore a face mask for the first time this morning, and saw other people wearing them too,” said Federica Montalba, an education coordinator. “What we saw on TV yesterday has arrived here today.“I’m not afraid of catching the virus, but I’m afraid of passing it on to my family who live an hour from here. I haven’t visited them since the first case was recorded in Palermo. What worries me most are people and their ignorance. Some people have not yet understood that we are facing an emergency and continue to act as if nothing has happened.”As the number of coronavirus cases across Italy continues to rise, Simona D’Alessi, a doctor at Palermo’s Benfratelli hospital, said there was a risk of “very high” contagion in hospitals.“We are running out of masks and gloves. People keep coming to the emergency room. Doctors can’t take holidays, because there’s an emergency and people need us, but I don’t know how long we can go on like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f24eaf03b56b1968708b9fa2d176242087e8dc4/0_116_3725_2235/master/3725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=588367c98ff5915838992be56cfdccc6","title":"what does prospect perpetual putin mean russia future","story":"President’s plan to remain in power beyond 2024 does not bode well either for Russia or the worldThe idea that Vladimir Putin would quietly retire always seemed fanciful, given the grisly fate that often befalls ageing autocrats, ex-dictators and even supposedly elected presidents once they let go of absolute power.In January, Russia’s president-in-perpetuity floated a range of possible constitutional “reforms” to help decide what happens in 2024 when his term in office expires.This was, in theory, a public consultation. Maybe the Duma (parliament) should have more powers, Putin suggested. Perhaps the role of the prime minister, or the state council, should be enhanced?When Putin fired his top toady, the unpopular Dmitri Medvedev – and the entire government – at a stroke, it seemed he meant business. It was a lethal move straight out of Ivan the Terrible’s old Kremlin playbook.The upheaval sparked earnest talk about the future of Putinism, the “power vertical”, and the post-Putin era. For a minute or two, it sounded like a real debate. Perhaps democracy in Russia was not dead after all.Big misunderstanding. Political analysts at home and abroad thought they were talking about future governance and how to manage the succession when Putin’s unbroken quarter century in power concluded.Putin, however, was talking about what, for him, is the most pressing question of the day: how to keep power forever. And on Tuesday, he gave his answer, in effect: “Forget all the other stuff, I’m staying.”It’s strange others did not think of it first. Putin’s brilliant wheeze – turning the presidential clock back to zero – means he and all of Russia can look forward to another two terms. Problem solved. Debate over. Putin was careful to tell the Duma, apparently in all sincerity, that term limits must be respected and the constitution honoured. Future elections in which he took part would be “naturally open and competitive”.If such smirking double-speak leaves observers confounded, imagine how Alexei Navalny and other persecuted opposition activists who have spent their lives fighting for free and fair elections must be feeling.Putin also reassured his adoring Duma fans that his personal Doomsday clock, permanently set at five minutes to midnight, would be put to a referendum next month.It’s true Putin is not as popular as he once was. The economy is a mess. The oil price war will make it worse. Corruption is out of control. But Putin has ways of winning even when he’s losing. It’s a safe bet the referendum will work out OK for him.What does the prospect of perpetual Putin mean for the future? At home, more croneyism, more repression, more national stagnation, more grand larceny by his magic circle of crooks and charlatans.Abroad, more disruption to the international order, more anti-western agitation and subversion, more rightwing populist poison, and more sniggering and bragging about liberalism’s “obsolescence”.Putin already has Donald Trump in the bag, so to speak, secretly beholden to him for reasons still unexplained. If Trump wins a second term, there’s no end to the trouble the two of them may cause.Joe Biden, as Barack Obama’s vice-president, also tried to “reset” the Russian clock, but in a different way. It didn’t work then. And Biden is unlikely to have better luck now, even if he gets the chance.In Europe, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, battled Putin over Crimea and Ukraine and got nowhere. Now she’s on her way out. Boris Johnson is no match. And France’s Emmanuel Macron could be writing his memoirs by the time 2024 comes around.Among other world leaders, only China’s Xi Jinping, another self-proclaimed president-for-life, may still be around when Putin’s starts the clock ticking again. And for all their differences, Xi and Putin share one big aim: reducing western power.Putin’s 2024 CV reads like a roll-call of 21st-century woes: endless strife in contested countries such as Syria, Libya and Ukraine, a UN system mired in endless stalemate, nationalist delusions peddled, elections fiddled, opponents assassinated, wealth stolen and democracy in retreat.Putin survives through the ruthless exercise of power, spurred by malign intent, greed, and personal spite. He will not name a successor, for he can never retire. He has too many enemies to ever rest easy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4198679.1583848118!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus ryanair aer lingus to suspend all italian flights for a almost a month","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRyanair said it was continuing to comply fully with WHO and national government guidance and travel bans.Ryanair is to suspend its full flight schedule to and from and within Italy, following the decision of the Italian Government to “lock down” the entire country to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus.

There is no such advice at this point.” The spokesman said that any decisions regarding responses to the virus are proportionate, necessary and based on specific public health advice. “No other response is appropriate,” he said.Public health professionals will contact schools if there is any action to be taken and schools have been advised not to take unilateral action. “The Department is deeply conscious of the significance of decisions concerning school closures, and the potential impact any such decisions would have on parents, families and the wider community,” the spokesman said.“This is an evolving situation and the health advice is being updated on a daily basis. The Departments of Education and Skills and Department of Health will continue to work closely together on this issue.”While the department has declined to comment on many schools are closed due to the coronavirus threat, it is understood that at least four schools have been closed since last week.The schools - one in the Dublin area and three in the west - have been closed since last week on the advice of health authorities after iniduals tested positive for coronavirus.Schools, pre-schools, higher education and parents, meanwhile, have been provided with advice and guidance in respect of Covid-19.

Photograph: EPA Hundreds of people have been tested for coronavirus across the State so far. But what do you need to know about testing?Who gets tested?According to the Health Service Executive (HSE), it tests people who have either been in close contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, or have been to a place where there is spread of coronavirus in the last 14 days, and who are also exhibiting symptoms such as a cough, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties or a fever.People with a severe lung infection may also be tested.People who are not feeling well are advised not to go to their GP or emergency department, and instead are advised to make contact with one of these health services by phone.Where does testing take place?In the early days of the crisis, testing took place in emergency departments or other hospital settings. However, increasingly there is an emphasis on testing people in their own homes, with the National Ambulance Service taking responsibility for this testing. More than 300 people have now been tested in this manner.There are other ways of getting tested, such as the pop-up facility established in a former Garda station in Lahinch, Co Clare.Who is responsible for testing and how does it work?The test is generally taken by swabbing someone’s nose or throat, but a respiratory sample can be taken from sputum if people are coughing. Testing and a molecular diagnosis then follows.Testing was initially carried out in the UK, but the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRD) in University College Dublin developed a test for the virus and it is now responsible for Irish tests. A test that is submitted before 10am can be turned around before teatime, but any later than that and a result will not be available before the next day.Are there privately available tests?At least three companies in Ireland have developed, or are in the process of developing, diagnostic tests for Covid-19.Co Antrim company Randox is the most advanced in this regard, having shipped tests kits last week to hospitals in China.Randox’s system, which requires laboratories to already have its proprietary technology, can process up to 324 patient samples over an eight hour period.Dublin-based Hibergene is developing a test which it says would deliver results within 60 minutes. While the company has made “rapid progress” through the early phase of its testing, the product will only be available for sale in the coming months.Elsewhere, Reagent Genie has developed a testing kit for researchers including academics and companies involved in developing a vaccine. Their swab test takes about three hours from start to finish but currently is not validated to be used on patients.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"But blanket restrictions on visiting at nursing homes should be lifted and funeral directors\u0026rsquo guidelines \u0026lsquounnecessary\u0026rsquo, officials sayProtesters in west Dublin have used placards stating \u0026lsquomore social housing for the Irish\u0026rsquoDepartment of Education says decision to shut schools would be made on public health adviceDispute arose between farmer and the foundation that owns Russborough estateDrop may reflect GPs\u0026rsquo reluctance to refer patients amid coronavirus outbreakSt Patrick\u0026rsquos Day parades across the State to be cancelledIdentical statements issued simultaneously by Fianna F\u0026aacuteil and Fine Gael say detailed talks to startDayne Ormond kicked Alan Reynolds full in the face as he lay on the ground, judge notesTwo get partially suspended sentence after stealing stock from River IslandMichael Barr was murdered at the Sunset House pub in Dublin\u0026rsquos north inner cityResidents group was last year granted permission by court to seek judicial reviewFailure to adopt adequate measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions allegedOne Cork medical practice moves to mostly phone consultations to reduce virus riskPlanning related to part of former school site in south DublinDepartment of Education says decision to shut schools would be made on public health advicePensioner charged with arson and damage of houses and oil tanksMost likely date for sitting is Friday, March 20th, according to Cathaoirleach Denis O\u0026rsquoDonovanMr Justice Birmingham says trial judge\u0026rsquos instructions to jury on defence of provocation were clearStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4198480.1583867944!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus biggest daily increase as 10 new cases confirmed","story":"The Government has agreed an aid package of some €3bn  to deal with the public health and economic impact of coronavirus.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            The deserted Corso Venezia main street  in downtown Milan  on Tuesday morning as a nationwide lockdown begins.

File photograph: Getty Ten new discovered cases of coronavirus have been reported this evening, the biggest daily increase recorded since the disease was found here at the end of February.The new cases bring the total number of cases in the Republic to 34 another four cases were reported in Northern Ireland today, bringing its total to 16.Five of the new cases relate to travel from an affected area, two related to hospital transmission or possible hospital transmission, and three are associated with close contact with a confirmed case.The new cases involve six males and four females. Five of the cases were in the south of the country, three in the east and two in the west.There has also been a massive increase in the number of people being tested, up to 1,784 from 297 a week ago.Asked whether schools would be closed to curb the spread of the virus, the State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said such a measure could be deployed “at some point in time” depending on what happened, “but that time is not necessarily now”.Blanket restrictions in place on visiting at nursing homes and some hospitals, aimed at curbing the risk of infection, should be lifted, Dr Holohan said.Dr Holohan said visitor restrictions - which were introduced in private nursing home across the State earlier this week - had a major impact on residents, for whom social interaction was a key part of wellbeing.While restrictions might be necessary in a particular nursing home depending on circumstances, Dr Holohan said there was no case for across-the-board restrictions. “We want to avoid introducing measure before they are really necessary,” he said.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NEPHT), at a meeting on Tuesday, declared that “socially restrictive actions” around hospitals and nursing homes were “not necessary at this moment in time,” according to a statement issued later.Public health officials also described the measures recommended by undertakers, including the immediate cremation of deceased people in body-bags, as “unnecessary”.Detailed guidelines on the handling of deceased people who have Covid-19 are to be published on Wednesday and it will be evident from these that the measures proposed by the Irish Association of Funeral Directors are not necessary, Dr John Cuddihy, director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre said.The officials said people should be encouraged to follow respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene procedures in order to protect vulnerable groups, including older people and patients with underlying conditions. People should not visit if they themselves are unwell.Earlier, details emerged of the four new cases of Covid-19 detected in Northern Ireland. All four are adults. One case involved recent travel from Northern Italy. Three can be traced to a previously reported case that involved recent travel to Northern Italy.The annual St Patrick’s reception in Washington DC, hosted by the Irish Ambassador to the United States, has been cancelled.

Ryanair said the suspension of internal flights would come into force at midnight. Flights into and out of Italy will be suspended at midnight on Friday, March 13th. The measures will be in place until April 8th.Aer Lingus has cancelled all flights to and from Italy from Wednesday, March 11th, until April 3rd. This morning, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said residents of Ireland should not travel to Italy unless it is absolutely necessary.Minister for Business Heather Humphreys has meanwhile cancelled her St Patrick’s trip to the US west coast.

There have been 3,817 deaths.

Lectures at Trinity College Dublin will be suspended from tomorrow. Irish response All St Patrick’s Day parades across the State were cancelled on Monday in a bid to curtail the spread of the virus. Mr Coveney said while Ireland remains in the containment phase, it was inevitable the country would move into the delay phase as more cases emerged. Because there is no vaccine and no treatment, the only way of limiting the spread is through good public community care and health care, he said.“We are trying to provide responses that are proportionate. We are trying to follow public health advice. We need to listen to the experts and the advice they give.” The Government was not ruling out any course of action, he said. If the virus starts to spread in different clusters around the country, then the Government will delay the spread “as best we can. The challenge is to slow down infection, to give health authorities time to cope.”Mr Coveney pointed out that even if only a small percentage of those infected suffer a significant health impact, the fatal percentage could mean thousands of deaths. “This is a challenge that is unprecedented. A lot is happening, advice will be upgraded on a daily basis.”Any decisions on public gatherings need to be made on the basis of sound evidence, he said. His own schedule for a trip to New York for St Patrick’s Day is being reviewed on a daily basis, he said.Any measures with regard to the coronavirus are only going to work if the public co-operates. “Together we can save lives.”Ireland’s Iseq stock market index rallied early on Tuesday, as global equity markets recovered some of the huge losses sustained in the previous session in the biggest sell-off since the 2008 financial crash.Assessment of impact On Monday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar delivered a bleak assessment of the potential consequences of the outbreak in Ireland.“It is possible we are facing events that are unprecedented in modern times,” Mr Varadkar said later, at a press conference unveiling a €3 billion aid package to deal with the crisis.The virus cannot be stopped, he said, but “it can be slowed” with the right response from the health service and across society.The Taoiseach warned more than half of the population could contract Covid-19. He referenced death rates for the virus ranging from under 1 per cent to more than 3 per cent, meaning large numbers of people could die of the disease in a worst-case scenario. Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan told a meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on Covid-19 earlier that the outbreak was a pandemic, even if that term was not actually being used officially.The crisis could last between 12 and 22 weeks, according to those present at a briefing for leaders of the Opposition.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus q a we are now in uncharted waters","story":"It seems like the world has been turned upside down in recent days as a result of the coronavirus spread. Where are we now?We are in absolutely uncharted waters. And yes the world has been turned upside down. What started out as a flu-like illness passing among a relatively small number of people in Wuhan, a Chinese city most of us had probably never heard of, has spread across the world with frightening speed. At the time of writing – Tuesday, March 10th – more than 110,000 people in over 100 countries have now contracted coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, and almost 4,000 people have died.How serious is it?It is very serious, there is no two ways about it. While the vast majority of people who contract coronavirus will be fine within a couple of weeks, about 15 per cent of people will become very ill while about 5 per cent will get critically ill. The mortality rate of the illness is fluctuating from country to country and from week to week as it spreads, but with the information we have at this stage it looks like about 2 per cent of those who get the illness may die. The number falls dramatically amongst younger people and – so far at least – the percentage of children who have become seriously ill or died is minuscule.How does 2 per cent compare with flu?The mortality rate of Covid-19 is about 20 times higher than the seasonal flu. And while a mortality rate of around 2 per cent may seem small, if the disease takes hold in a country and many people are taken ill – as has happened in Italy – it can quickly equate to thousands of deaths and an enormous volume of people requiring hospital treatment. There are few countries in the world that are in a position to cope with the demands such a situation might place on their health system.How fast is it spreading?Fast. Three weeks ago there had been no reported cases in Italy. One way of measuring transmissibility is the virus’s reproduction number or R0 (“R naught”), effectively the number of people an infected person will go on to infect. Estimates from China put the R0 at somewhere between 1.5 and 4, compared with 1.4 for the average flu (and up to 18 for measles).However, R0 varies across different environments. It can be reduced by effective hygiene control measures – handwashing, controlled coughing and sneezing, even social distancing. It is also worth remembering that while the people of Wuhan didn’t know what was about to hit them in December and January, the rest of the world has had more warning.What is the incubation period?The incubation period – the time between infection and the onset of symptoms of the disease such as cough, fever and shortness of breath – is thought to range from two to 14 days.Can you pass it on without symptoms?This is a big area of uncertainty. The European Union’s disease prevention agency is set to tighten its advice on coronavirus in the days ahead as evidence emerges that people showing no symptoms can spread the virus. Until Monday the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) had advised that “people who are infected but who do not show symptoms cannot transmit the virus”, a belief that has influenced policy and quarantine decisions in several EU countries as cases balloon. This was in conflict with advice from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The WHO states that, while rare, “there are people who can shed Covid-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset”.Will we cope in Ireland?The HSE says isolation rooms have been identified in all major hospitals, where patients would be treated. We have only one state-of-the-art isolation unit in the country, in the Mater hospital, but local arrangements and transfers to the Mater would probably suffice in the event of a small number of cases. The fear is that there will be a large number of cases. Emergency medicine doctors have said they don’t have the ICU beds to handle that. One doctor in St Vincent’s hospital has pointed out that he has not had a free ICU bed since Christmas.How many people could fall ill here?The Business Post reported on Sunday, March 8th, that forecasts were suggesting that about 40 per cent of the population could become sick as a result of the virus. Paul Reid of the HSE said he could not dispute reported projections that up to 1.9 million people could become sick as a result of contracting the coronavirus, although he said the work was not yet concluded and the evidence was changing day by day.Can the virus be treated?It cannot be cured, if that is what you are asking. Doctors try to keep critically ill patients’ bodies going, providing breathing support where necessary and waiting for their immune system to fight off the virus. There is no vaccine as yet, though one might be ready by the end of the year. Antivirals are being tested in China, but there are no clear results yet.Do face masks work?People wearing face masks are likely to be the most enduring images of 2020, but many of these devices are not as efficient at preventing the transmission of viruses as people might hope. The consensus now is that regular hand-washing is a far more effective way of protecting yourself. People might derive comfort from masks, but it is worth bearing in mind that they were originally designed to filter the air you breath out and to protect healthy persons from sick persons, rather than the other way around.If I think I have the virus, what should I do?If you’ve come back from one of the affected areas – such as northern Italy where person-to-person transmission is widespread – and you have symptoms, contact your GP urgently and do not leave the house. The principal symptoms are headache, dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain and fever. If you have come back from these areas and are feeling well the advice is to consult the HSE website or ring the HSELive helpline on 1850 24 1850 for advice.How should those being tested behave with co-residents?The HSE advises that family members or people sharing a residence with a suspected case should avoid contact, communicate by phone and not answer calls to the door.What is happening in Ireland now?As of Tuesday, March 10th, the number of people in the Republic who have been diagnosed with the illness is still small. A total of 24 cases of the virus had so far been confirmed, but the outlook for the days, weeks and months ahead is still grim.Are projections of 1.9m sick people an exaggeration?Not according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. He delivered a bleak assessment on Monday, March 9th, of the potential consequences of the coronavirus outbreak in Ireland. “It is possible we are facing events that are unprecedented in modern times,” he said. He warned that more than half of the population could contract Covid-19 and he referenced death rates for the virus ranging from less than 1 per cent to more than 3 per cent, meaning large numbers of people could die of the disease in a worst-case scenario.“For the vast majority of the population this will be a mild illness and may even by asymptomatic,” he said. “However, there will be a significant part of the population who will require critical care.” The virus cannot be stopped, he said, but “it can be slowed” with the right response from the health service and across society.How can it be slowed?There are things that can be done by the Government and its agencies. But there is one thing every person in this country can do to help slow the spread of the virus.What?Yes. There is universal agreement among politicians and health professionals that proper hand sanitation is the most effective thing people can do to stop the spread of the illness. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets of saliva or mucus. These droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands, then transferred when someone touches their face, causing infection. That is why frequent hand-washing and the use of hand sanitisers are so important in combating the spread of Covid-19.And how do I do that properly?To answer that we will turn to the official HSE guidelines.Wet your hands with warm water and apply soap. Rub your hands together until the soap forms a lather. Rub the top of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails. Do this for about 15 seconds. Rinse your hands under running water. Dry your hands with a clean towel or paper towel.What else is being done to stop it spreading here?A lot. A €3 billion package to deal with coronavirus will pump more money into the health service, help at-risk businesses and change the rules around sick pay to encourage people who will need to self-isolate and stay away from their workplaces. An additional €435 million will be allocated to the HSE. Minister for Health Simon Harris has said this money is to be used to increase the public health capacity to trace contacts of people with the virus, as well as providing for more beds, more overtime, more staff and more homecare packages to help take pressure off hospitals.Is there more?There is a lot more. Patients have been told not to turn up at GP surgeries without an appointment in order to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus. And patients who have been to an affected area and are showing respiratory symptoms have been reminded not to go to their GP surgery, hospital emergency department, out-of-hours service or pharmacy. Instead they should phone ahead or call 112.What about public gatherings?All St Patrick’s Day parades across the country are being cancelled on foot of a recommendation of the National Public Health Emergency Team. Trinity College Dublin said all lectures would take place remotely. And both Ryanair and Aer Lingus said they would be cancelling all flights to and from Italy for almost a month. Ryanair is also cancelling all internal flights in Italy for the same period.What about schools?To date only a handful of schools – in Dublin and Clare – have closed following known cases of Covid-19. During a containment phase, wider school closures “are not justified”, the European Centre for Disease Control has said. If transmission of the virus becomes widespread in the days ahead, school closures will be inevitable, even though they probably would not reduce the impact of the epidemic. For now, though, it seems unlikely.What is happening across the EU?According to data from the ECDC on Tuesday, 14,890 cases were reported in the EUEEA and the UK. Italy had reported 9,172 cases, followed by France on 1,412 and Spain on 1,204. Germany had reported 1,139 cases, while there were 321 in the Netherlands and 373 in the UK. Across the EU there were 532 deaths reported, with the vast majority being reported in Italy where – at the time of writing – 464 people had died.Italy is bearing the brunt of the virus?Italy has – so far – been the the epicentre of the outbreak in Europe, and the country’s 60 million people have been placed in lockdown. Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte said after Italy’s death toll jumped by 97 to 463 that it was the country’s “darkest hour”.How are drug supplies in the EU?The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said it is closely monitoring what the spread of Covid-19 could mean for the pharmaceutical supply chains in the EU.Its officials are looking at ways to protect at-risk patients if there is a temporary lockdown of medicine manufacturing sites in areas affected by Covid-19. It is important to stress that there are no reports of such shortages of medicines within the EU.Okay, so talk to me about travel?On Tuesday, March 10th, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney announced an update on his Department’s travel advice, saying no residents of Ireland should travel to any part of Italy unless it is absolutely necessary. The red warning “do not travel” status is extremely unusual and will have to be heeded by everyone.Has it been heeded by airlines?Yes. Both Ryanair and Aer Lingus are suspending all flights to and from and within Italy following the decision of the Italian government to lock down the entire country to contain the spread of virus.Ryanair said the suspension of internal flights would come into force at midnight on Wednesday. Flights into and out of Italy will be suspended at midnight on Friday, March 13th. The measures will be in place until April 8th. Aer Lingus has cancelled all flights to and from Italy from Wednesday, March 11th until April 3rd.What if I am in Italy and not due back until Saturday?There has been no formal comment from Aer Lingus, but Ryanair passengers looking for repatriation can obtain a free move to an earlier Ryanair flight operating up until midnight on Friday, March 13th. Affected passengers who were due to travel to the country will be able to choose between a full refund or a travel credit that can be redeemed on Ryanair flights in the next 12 months.Are the Italian land borders still open?Yes, but the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, has announced an entry ban for people entering Austria from Italy by car, train or plane, unless they can provide a doctor’s certificate. Controls will be imposed along the border between the two countries. Austrians visiting Italy will be allowed to return home only if they agree to a two-week home quarantine.Is Ireland using such controls on those returning from Italy?As yet, no.How will this affect my summer holidays?It is too early to say what impact it is going to have on summer travel. If you had asked us this question two weeks ago we would have said that everything will be grand. Now, we’re not so sure. It could be that by July, the start of the high season for tourism in Europe, the virus will have peaked. Maybe it will be gone altogether. It could be that things will be much worse than they are today. There is too much uncertainty to make a firm decision on your travel plans now.So what advice can you give me?Pay attention to the travel advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and other relevant sources.Is that official advice important?It is very important. If an official advisory against travel is in place then people who have booked independent holidays and have travel insurance to that location could be able to claim for any losses they are likely to incur. With advisories in place, people who have booked with tour operators should also be able to process refunds or reschedule trips.What about flights?According to the European Consumer Centre Ireland (ECC Ireland), a natural occurrence such as Covid-19 that causes travel disruption is considered “extraordinary circumstances” outside the control of a transport provider, such as an airline. Consequently, compensation would not normally apply. For air travel, according to EU Regulation 261, passengers on cancelled flights may be entitled to have their journey either rerouted to the final holiday destination or refunded. If a land or sea journey is cancelled, passengers are entitled to rerouting or a refund.What about package holidays?For package holidays involving a journey to, or a stay in, areas affected by travel restrictions due to the virus, consumers may have the right to terminate the booking contract without paying a termination fee. This applies only to unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances that may pose a significant risk to human health and prevent consumers from making use of or reaching the destination of their booked holiday, as agreed in the travel contract.I am headng overseas soon. Can I cancel?If consumers choose to cancel their holiday to an area where no emergency measures have been declared, that is their right, but the holiday cancellation is, of course, strictly within the limits of their booking contract. Refunds may be possible, but that is by no means certain. And if passengers cancel flights voluntarily they are entitled to a full refund of airport taxes as the cancellation takes place before the flight check-in operation. But it is worth bearing in mind that admin fees imposed by airlines often make such refunds pitifully small.What about travel insurance?Now would be as good a time as any to ensure you have adequate travel insurance covering any trips you may have coming up. Ensure your policy covers cancellations as a result of official warnings from government not to travel to a destination. But timing is crucial here. Mapfre, one of the biggest travel insurance underwriters in the State, says that if a policy covers a government recommendation to avoid a country or area, a claim will be considered only if that recommendation is in place within 48 hours of a person’s intended departure.Anything else?If you are travelling anywhere in the EU in the months ahead and do not have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or think the one you do have may have expired, then get it sorted.Remind me of what the EHIC is again?If you are travelling in Europe, the card gives you access to public health services at no cost. If you have a smartphone, download the EHIC app to help you navigate overseas health systems, and remember: your card needs to be renewed every five years. Don’t ever pay for the card. Some sites will try charging for the service, but it is free through the official site, ehic.ie.What else is happening?This remains first and foremost a public health emergency. But the pandemic is almost certainly tipping the world into a global recession. Airlines and the tourism sector at home and abroad will suffer. Some businesses will close. Stock markets will continue to take a hammering. Pension funds will be hit hard and jobs will be lost.What’s this about stockpiling food and fighting over toilet roll?That is happening alright. In countries as far apart as Japan, Australia and the US there have been reports of panicked shoppers stocking up on everything from long-life milk to noodles, while videos of people fighting in supermarket aisles over toilet paper in Australia have gone viral as coronavirus has spread.Large retail chains in the UK, including Tesco, have started rolling out a rationing system for key products and shoppers are not being allowed buy more than five of certain goods, including antibacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables. Pictures of empty shelves are circulating widely on social media.Is it happening in Ireland?While there has been no formal rationing in Ireland – and no reports of loo roll riots – this country has not been immune to the panic buying and there has been a noticeable surge in the sale of canned goods, pasta and cleaning products in supermarkets here. Items deemed to be essential in the current climate, including hand sanitiser and face masks, have largely disappeared from shelves while wholesalers are reporting sales levels for groceries normally not seen outside of the peak shopping period before Christmas.This is all incredibly gloomy and scary.It is. But it is not forever. Things will settle down. Most experts say several scenarios are possible with Covid-19. It might join the four other existing coronaviruses in being endemic around the world, causing respiratory illness of varying degrees of severity. Or it may become a seasonal illness like the flu, adding to the pressure on hospitals during the winter. It is important to bear in mind that scientists all over the world are working on vaccines and treatments, and while they are still some way off, such treatments will come.So how is this going to turn out?We don’t know. But it is worth looking at China, where this whole thing is believed to have started. Its most recent figures put the number of new cases across the whole country at 19, with 17 additional deaths. It has closed the 14 emergency hospitals it built in Wuhan and Chinese President Xi Jinping flew into the city on Tuesday morning to inspect new coronavirus control efforts, according to state news broadcaster CCTV.Anything else?Just one thing.

Photograph: Remko De WaalEPAThe position of Dutch authorities was that only people with symptoms could transmit coronavirus. It was repeated by the government, national and local health authorities, justifying a cascade of decisions that allowed the Netherlands to keep up a “business as usual” attitude even as the virus exponentially spread.The problem was, it was wrong. As early as February 21st, Chinese doctors published a case of apparent asymptomatic transmission German doctors wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine on March 5th to warn of a case near Munich. The World Health Organisation advises transmission without symptoms is possible.Despite this the Dutch government and health authorities stuck to looser quarantine advice than other European countries up to the time of publishing, telling people who had travelled from China, outbreak spots in Italy, and Iran, that they need only self-quarantine if experiencing symptoms.As well as being underpinned by a flawed assumption, the advice relies on people knowing whether they have symptoms or not. This is questionable: Chris Higgins, a GP in Australia, provoked an outcry after treating 70 patients while he had what he thought was the tail end of a mild cold, before he tested positive for Covid-19.It’s also in stark contrast to the approach in the countries most successful at containing the virus, such as Taiwan and Singapore, where authorities drew on their experience of the Sars outbreak to implement strict travel checks and preventative quarantine before even registering a first confirmed case.Inidual freedomsThe case of the Netherlands shows how a flawed belief about transmission filtered down throughout society, enabling the virus to spread. It also makes for a grand experiment in what happens when a country takes a relaxed approach to the virus, placing the maintenance of normality, personal responsibility and inidual freedoms first.The first coronavirus diagnosis in the Netherlands was on February 27th. As authorities traced his contacts, they found he had attended Carnival in the city of Tilburg in the North Brabant region on February 21st-25th. “The patient was not contagious in the days he celebrated the carnival,” the mayor of Tilburg Theo Weterings told media.In the following days, two more people who were at Tilburg carnival were diagnosed with coronavirus. One of them was a worker at Bannink Packaging in Drenthe in the northern Netherlands. His partner was also infected.\u0026nbspBannink Packaging continued to operate as normal, saying the employee was not sick when he came to work. “The chance that he has infected colleagues is therefore rather small,” the spokesperson told media.On March 4th, another Bannink Packaging employee – who commuted from Germany – was diagnosed with coronavirus.\u0026nbsp“In Germany they are a lot stricter with testing . . . We should not exaggerate. Production continues as normal. In that respect, it is business as usual,” a company representative told media. “We advise our employees to stay at home if they have symptoms. We cannot do more.”On March 5th a third employee was diagnosed as positive.\u0026nbspOn March 7th four more people tested positive in Coevorden, where Bannink Packaging is based.That day 900 students of the university society Vindicat returned from a mass ski trip in Piedmont in northern Italy in a convoy of buses to the Netherlands. Amid public concern, authorities met the students and tested four, who were found negative.“Someone who has no symptoms is not contagious,” Jossy van den Boogaard, MD in infectious disease control at local health authority GGD Groningen told media.“Can the students also infect others while they have no symptoms? No,” was the official advice. “What if someone decides to go to work or take an exam? This is their own responsibility.”No panicOn March 8th it was announced that a cleaning lady married to a Bannink Packaging employee had tested positive. The director of the school she works at wrote to parents to say there was no reason to panic, and that children could go to school as normal.By this point the outbreak in the carnival region of North Brabant had reached the point that there were shortages of protective equipment for health workers, and people were advised not to call their doctor unless their symptoms were serious.Lawmaker Eva van Esch told parliament a friend of hers had tested positive who had been refused a test for a week after returning from Italy with symptoms. Once positive, the friend had been asked to keep the diagnosis quiet and not to tell her work or contacts, van Esch said.“My party therefore wonders whether this government is actually focusing on preventing the spread of the disease, or whether the health services are primarily concerned with preventing panic,” van Esch said.Dutch testing capacity is limited, forcing authorities to prioritise testing people with a clear link. Roughly 6,000 tests had been done in the Netherlands as of March 7th, national public health institute the RIVM said, a figure that includes double-testing to exclude false positives, and testing for recovery.Twelve days after the first diagnosis, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Netherlands had risen from 1 to 382.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199007.1583862982!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"russia opens path for putin to retain power until 2036","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Russian president Vladimir Putin speaks during a plenary session of the State Duma  in Moscow, Russia, on Tuesday. Photograph: Yuri KochetkovEPARussian deputies have backed a proposal that could allow Vladimir Putin, who has ruled the country for 20 years, to remain president until 2036.Former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space and now a deputy for the ruling United Russia party, told parliament on Tuesday that constitutional changes planned for this year should “reset” presidential term limits, allowing Mr Putin to run for office again when his current mandate expires in 2024.United Russia supported her motion but said Mr Putin should be consulted, and he quickly made the short journey from the Kremlin to the Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament.“In principle, this option would be possible under one condition,” Mr Putin said of Ms Tereshkova’s proposal.“That the constitutional court of the Russian Federation gives an official ruling that such an amendment does not contradict the principles and main provisions of the basic law – the constitution.”Vladimir LeninHe said the proposal should also be approved by the public in a vote on constitutional changes that is scheduled for April 22nd, which happens to be the 150th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Lenin, founder of the Soviet Union. Given the Kremlin’s influence over Russia’s law courts, state media and voting system, there is little doubt that the amendments will go through if Mr Putin continues to support them.Russian citizens will have their say next month only after both houses of parliament have approved the constitutional changes, which deputies backed on Tuesday in the second of three readings. They also voted in favour of Ms Tereshkova’s proposal.Mr Putin (67) has not said what he plans to do when his mandate ends, but his announcement in January of a constitutional shake-up fuelled speculation that he was examining ways to retain power beyond 2024.This is his fourth presidential term and he has also served as Russia’s prime minister. The changes supported by the Duma would allow him to run for another two six-year stints in the Kremlin ending in 2036, when he will turn 84.Centralised controlMr Putin’s supporters praise him for bringing strong, centralised control back to Russia while seeing no other contender for the presidency, while critics point out that the former KGB agent has used the levers of state to stifle opposition and crush potential competitors.As Russian markets and the rouble reeled from a plunge in oil prices, Mr Putin told deputies that the presidency should continue to be the nation’s most powerful institution, so as to provide stability and ensure the country “evolves” only gradually and withstands domestic and international turbulence.“It is namely the president who is the guarantor of the constitution, or to put it more simply, the guarantor of the security of our state, its internal stability and evolutionary development...We have already had enough revolutions,” he said.“Everyone understands full well that inside the country, unfortunately, a lot has been done ‘on the fly’ as people say,” Mr Putin added. “We still have a lot of vulnerability, including with regard to domestic political stability, inter-ethnic and inter-religious harmony and economic and social development.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Joe Biden tells Detroit worker \u0026#39you\u0026#39re full of s--t\u0026#39 in row over gun controlCoronavirus latest news: Italy death toll jumps by 168 in a day, as UK cases rise to 373Rishi Sunak promises \u0026#39decade of growth for everybody\u0026#39 in hundreds of billions pounds BudgetBritons left stranded in Italy as airlines cancel flights in and out of the coronavirus capital of EuropeGrandparents who step in to care for children should have access to paid leave, MPs saySNP official said he would \u0026#39sit on\u0026#39 claims Alex Salmond sexually assaulted woman, court hearsNigerian monarch dethroned after claiming Kano officials are failing to address Islamist tensionsComment: As the crisis spreads, this man will have the toughest job in Government.

There were 299 active coronavirus cases in Britain on Monday, up from 32 at the start of last week – an increase of 834 per cent over the seven days. It took four days for the UK\u0027s number of cases to last double, from 106 on March 5 to 299 on March 9, putting the country in the middle of the pack in terms of the doubling rate of the virus.This is less than the rate of increase in Spain, where active cases have doubled in just two days. There, 460 people were said to have the virus, but that had increase to 1,013 on Monday.The doubling rate is, however, lower in countries in which the virus is already more established and has infected more people. In Japan and South Korea, for example, it took coronavirus nine days to last double its number of active cases.The countries with the highest number of recorded active cases as of Monday were China (18,880), Italy (7,985) and South Korea (7,307).It is important to note that other countries may have higher undetected cases because the official numbers are reliant upon rigorous testing and data collection methods in each country.The number of active cases in China – and in Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus – has fallen over the last week. Hubei has seen active cases drop by 40 per cent since last Monday, while in China the number has dropped by 67 per cent.While cases are still rising in South Korea, the country\u0027s rate of growth has slowed with cases currently doubling every nine days. The most concerning trajectory is in Italy, which has the second highest number of confirmed active cases and is currently seeing that number double every three days. The main goal for the UK Government as it faces coronavirus is to contain and delay it – part of its four-point contain, delay, research and mitigate strategy.This timeline is defined by the likely progress of an outbreak in five scenarios as it moves across Europe, and is taken from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU\u0027s main public health body. But looking at case data from across Europe, it\u0027s clear that different European countries are at different stages of this strategy – and with different levels of success.Most countries managed to delay major surges in cases for at least 20 days as the number of infections in Europe remained low.Daily data sourced from the World Health Organisation and compiled by John Hopkins University shows that some of the worst affected countries were able to contain the disease for weeks.In Italy, the first substantial increase in active cases (533 per cent) did not occur for 21 days after the country had detected its first case. The UK is following a similar trajectory, with a 400 per cent increase in active cases after 24 days.Countries detecting the virus later appear to be less successful in keeping numbers low. In Austria, Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands, the virus was detected for the first time less than two weeks ago. But once it was present, each country saw the number of confirmed cases double – or even triple – in the first three days.Francois Balloux, a professor of computational systems biology at University College London, told The  he thought it likely that the UK would follow the same pattern as Italy over the coming weeks.The trajectory of the epidemic in the UK is so far roughly comparable to the one in Northern Italy, but with the epidemic in northern Italy two to three weeks ahead of the situation in the UK, he said.The above graphic shows the speed at which cases increased in Italy. While lagging in total numbers, confirmed cases in the UK have doubled roughly once every three days in the last week, suggesting that Britain is on much the same track.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/10/17/adidas.jpg","title":"adidas google fifa mobile 20 ultimate team gmr boot smart","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Playing physical football will lead to improvements in virtual playersAdidas, Google and the Fifa game have teamed up to create a smart football boot.The technology – known as Adidas GMR – watches how people play in real life, allowing them to complete challenges or hit milestones.When they do, they will be rewarded with improvements within Fifa Mobile, allowing them to unlock in-game rewards or improve the performance of their team within Fifa Mobile Ultimate Team.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe technology brings together insoles made for Adidas football boots with Google\u0027s Jacquard technology, which allows smart fabric to be sewn into otherwise normal pieces of clothing.It has already been integrated into backpacks and denim jackets, for instance, allowing wearers to swipe on a sleeve and change the song that is playing on their phone.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

It’s a huge responsibility, and we know we’re going to make some mistakes.”Einhorn’s dilemma is playing out on a global stage. With the deadly virus now present in 100 countries, companies are unable to match demand for the masks needed by health workers. That’s led governments to jockey for supplies, including the US, which is stockpiling, and Germany and South Korea, which banned exports of masks altogether.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPublic health officials are warning that restrictive trade measures tied to medical supplies could worsen the shortfall and risk making poorer nations more vulnerable to the coronavirus’ spread.In some countries, including Japan and Germany, doctors are being told to reuse the single mask they get daily because of a lack of supply.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China“Most places are not prepared, so you now have a cascade of countries putting these export bans in place,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It’s not a long-term solution. Everyone throwing up export bans isn’t going to solve the problem of how you will get the products in time to serve these acute needs.”Peter Navarro, one of President Donald Trump’s trade advisers, met last week with a group of pharmaceutical companies to discuss supply chain vulnerabilities and ways to ensure that critical parts of the drug supply chain could move away from China -- or better, back to the U.S., people familiar with the meeting told Bloomberg. Navarro didn’t respond to requests for comment.Manufacturers need to boost production of masks by another 40 per cent\u0026nbspto meet demand, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director general. While the WHO has shipped supplies to 47 countries including Iran, Cambodia and Uganda, shortages will hit soon, especially of the N95 masks that block out 95 per cent\u0026nbspof airborne particulates to combat the current virus.“Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding,” Tedros said in a statement 3 March. “We can’t stop Covid-19 without protecting health workers first,” he said, referring to the illness caused by the virus.Despite Tedros’ appeal, South Korea, Germany and Russia announced export bans of masks and other protective gear days after. They join others nation or territories including India, Taiwan, Thailand, and Kazakhstan that earlier put export bans in place. The novel coronavirus has now spread to more than 113,000 cases globally and killed over 3,900 people.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Factories have since boosted production more than five-fold and are enlisting carmakers to manufacture them. That’s still not enough.In the US, increased efforts by mask makers 3M Co. and DuPont De Nemours Inc. are also falling short of demand. DuPont, which makes masks and protective body suits worn by first responders, said it’s increased production by more than three times its usual global capacity. 3M, the biggest American manufacturer of N95 respirators, has increased production since the outbreak in China.“We’ve added staff, we’ve added overtime, we’ve added technology, we’ve been increasing manufacturing lines,” said 3M spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich. “We expect this demand for respirators and other supplies to continue to outpace supply for the foreseeable future.”The dependence on China and a few other countries for masks has some calling for a rethink of supply chains. The World Medical Association, which represents physicians, wants governments to establish factories in major markets like the European Union and the U.S. to ensure adequate supply of critical drugs, vaccines and other medical necessities.The US only has about 1 per cent of the 3.5 billion masks it needs to combat a serious outbreak, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said. The country plans to buy 500 million surgical masks and N95 respirators for the national stockpile.Einhorn of Dealmed thinks the shortage isn’t likely to let up until the summer. The crisis may finally convince Americans to pay more for masks made in the US, he said. Dealmed is seeking bids for domestically-produced equipment.“The world shouldn’t be relying on one country for health care products,” Einhorn said. “We absolutely need to look at the supply chain.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They issued new forecasts on Monday amid the worst meltdown in global markets since the 2008 financial crash.Berenberg projected the Eurozone’s GDP to fall by 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year and 0.5 per cent in the second quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnalysts said the sweeping month-long lockdown imposed by Italy, the zone’s third largest economy, on 16 million people “goes beyond the disruptions we had anticipated”.“The Italian measures — and the possibility that other parts of Europe may move in the same direction in coming weeks — are likely to weigh significantly further on confidence in the near term,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe bank predicted Italy’s economy would contract by 1.2 per cent by the end of the 2020, and said its forecasts for the next few months would be “shaped much more by the coronavirus epidemic than by economic fundamentals or shifts in monetary or fiscal policy”.France’s central bank said it expected the country’s economy to barely grow in the first quarter of the year, cutting its GDP forecast from 0.3 per cent 0.1 per cent.Coronavirus could tip Europe into recession, OECD warnsThe country’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Europe needed a “call to arms” to defend the already weakened economy from an outbreak that has disrupted companies’ supply chains, forced airlines to cut capacity and prompted shoppers in some countries to stockpile food.The downbeat assessments made for a grim start to the week for European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers, who will meet in Frankfurt this week and may be forced to lower interest rates and step up bond purchases. The US Federal Reserve has already acted, with an unexpected easing last week.The ECB told most of its 3,500-plus staff to work from home on Monday to test how it could cope with a coronavirus shutdown.

Ethiopia recently planted a reported 350 million trees in a single day Morocco has undertaken the most ambitious solar power scheme in the world, recently completing a solar plant the size of San FranciscoElectric cars are taking off as a viable alternative to fossil fuel burning vehicles and major cities across the world are adding charging points to accomodateCities around the world are embracing cycling too, as a clean (and healthy) mode of transport. The Netherlands continues to lead the way with bikes far outnumbering peopleCycling infrastructure is taking over cities the world over, in the hope of reducing society\u0027s dependency on polluting vehiclesDespite positive steps being taken, humans continue to have a wildly adverse effect on the climate. There have been numerous major oil spills this decade, the most notable being the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010More recently, large swathes of the Amazon rainforest were set alight by people to clear land for agricultureThis decade may have seen horrors but it has led to an understanding that the next decade must see change if human life is to continueFinancial services companies that are not prepared for a transition to a low-carbon world may be penalised by the bank and ordered to hold additional capital, Mr Carney said.Mr Carney, who has led a movement to make companies disclose the climate risks they face, will leave the bank next week to take up a position as finance advisor to the UN climate change conference, COP26. In December he warned that climate change could render some financial assets worthless.His latest comments come as momentum\u0026nbspbuilds\u0026nbspto tackle climate change among fund managers that invest in environmentally-damaging businesses.Carbon emissions falling at fastest rate in 30 yearsDespite these moves, it remains difficult for ordinary consumers to weigh up the climate impact of their pensions, savings and investments.MPs on the Treasury committee are seeking ways to make it clear to investors what risks climate change poses to their savings.

The great variance in how well investments are protected from climate risk could leave savers and pension holders out of pocket.“More information is needed to help consumers make informed decisions.

It’s a huge responsibility, and we know we’re going to make some mistakes.”Einhorn’s dilemma is playing out on a global stage. With the deadly virus now present in 100 countries, companies are unable to match demand for the masks needed by health workers. That’s led governments to jockey for supplies, including the US, which is stockpiling, and Germany and South Korea, which banned exports of masks altogether.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPublic health officials are warning that restrictive trade measures tied to medical supplies could worsen the shortfall and risk making poorer nations more vulnerable to the coronavirus’ spread.In some countries, including Japan and Germany, doctors are being told to reuse the single mask they get daily because of a lack of supply.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China“Most places are not prepared, so you now have a cascade of countries putting these export bans in place,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It’s not a long-term solution. Everyone throwing up export bans isn’t going to solve the problem of how you will get the products in time to serve these acute needs.”Peter Navarro, one of President Donald Trump’s trade advisers, met last week with a group of pharmaceutical companies to discuss supply chain vulnerabilities and ways to ensure that critical parts of the drug supply chain could move away from China -- or better, back to the U.S., people familiar with the meeting told Bloomberg. Navarro didn’t respond to requests for comment.Manufacturers need to boost production of masks by another 40 per cent\u0026nbspto meet demand, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director general. While the WHO has shipped supplies to 47 countries including Iran, Cambodia and Uganda, shortages will hit soon, especially of the N95 masks that block out 95 per cent\u0026nbspof airborne particulates to combat the current virus.“Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding,” Tedros said in a statement 3 March. “We can’t stop Covid-19 without protecting health workers first,” he said, referring to the illness caused by the virus.Despite Tedros’ appeal, South Korea, Germany and Russia announced export bans of masks and other protective gear days after. They join others nation or territories including India, Taiwan, Thailand, and Kazakhstan that earlier put export bans in place.

Factories have since boosted production more than five-fold and are enlisting carmakers to manufacture them. That’s still not enough.In the US, increased efforts by mask makers 3M Co. and DuPont De Nemours Inc. are also falling short of demand. DuPont, which makes masks and protective body suits worn by first responders, said it’s increased production by more than three times its usual global capacity. 3M, the biggest American manufacturer of N95 respirators, has increased production since the outbreak in China.“We’ve added staff, we’ve added overtime, we’ve added technology, we’ve been increasing manufacturing lines,” said 3M spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich. “We expect this demand for respirators and other supplies to continue to outpace supply for the foreseeable future.”The dependence on China and a few other countries for masks has some calling for a rethink of supply chains. The World Medical Association, which represents physicians, wants governments to establish factories in major markets like the European Union and the U.S. to ensure adequate supply of critical drugs, vaccines and other medical necessities.The US only has about 1 per cent of the 3.5 billion masks it needs to combat a serious outbreak, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said. The country plans to buy 500 million surgical masks and N95 respirators for the national stockpile.Einhorn of Dealmed thinks the shortage isn’t likely to let up until the summer. The crisis may finally convince Americans to pay more for masks made in the US, he said. Dealmed is seeking bids for domestically-produced equipment.“The world shouldn’t be relying on one country for health care products,” Einhorn said. “We absolutely need to look at the supply chain.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Apple\u0027s annual WWDC event, which marks the highlight of its year for new software features and its developers, is also likely to be cancelled under the ban.Apple holds its new phone launches in its Steve Jobs Theater, which has a capacity of 1,000 and is usually fully packed.\u0026nbspIt is very possible that Apple could launch the new phone without a large scale event, and it has released products with much smaller events or without a launch event at all in the past.Its Worldwide Developers Conference brings together more than 5,000 developers and as a consequence is even less likely to go ahead. That event has not yet been announced either but runs on an annual schedule, being held in San Jose every year.Previous reports have suggested that Apple\u0027s product pipeline – including the iPhone 12, which is expected much later in the year – could be affected by coronavirus, which is reducing both demand for new devices as well as the ability to supply enough models in time.It will also mean other major events such as sporting fixtures will no longer go ahead.The ban had been brought in to slow the spread of the disease, said\u0026nbspSanta Clara County health officer\u0026nbspSara Cody in a statement.Created with Sketch.Streets of Italy empty in coronavirus lockdown Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Via Partenope in Naples is empty after Italy was put on lockdown on 10 March A waiter stands by empty tables outside a restaurant in St Mark\u0027s Square in Venice on 9 MarchEmpty stands during a football match between Sassuolo and Brescia at the Mapei stadium in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy on 9 MarchShops are shuttered on an empty street in Venice on 9 MarchPeople keep a safe distance while lining up to enter a post office in Rome on 10 MarchA canal and the roads next to it are completely empty on 9 MarchA completely empty bridge in Venice on 9 MarchA canal pathway in Venice is empty after Italy was put on lockdownAn empty square in Venice on 9 MarchA nearly empty tram drives through Milan on 10 MarchAn empty bakery in Milan on 10 MarchAn empty street in Milan on 10 MarchThe Via Partenope in Naples is empty after Italy was put on lockdown on 10 March A waiter stands by empty tables outside a restaurant in St Mark\u0027s Square in Venice on 9 MarchEmpty stands during a football match between Sassuolo and Brescia at the Mapei stadium in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy on 9 MarchShops are shuttered on an empty street in Venice on 9 MarchPeople keep a safe distance while lining up to enter a post office in Rome on 10 MarchA canal and the roads next to it are completely empty on 9 MarchA completely empty bridge in Venice on 9 MarchA canal pathway in Venice is empty after Italy was put on lockdownAn empty square in Venice on 9 MarchA nearly empty tram drives through Milan on 10 MarchAn empty bakery in Milan on 10 MarchAn empty street in Milan on 10 March“Today’s order and new recommendations will reduce the number of people who develop severe illness and will help prevent our healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed.“This is critically important for anyone with healthcare needs, not just those most vulnerable to serious illness from\u0026nbspCOVID-19.”\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They issued new forecasts on Monday amid the worst meltdown in global markets since the 2008 financial crash.Berenberg projected the Eurozone’s GDP to fall by 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year and 0.5 per cent in the second quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnalysts said the sweeping month-long lockdown imposed by Italy, the zone’s third largest economy, on 16 million people “goes beyond the disruptions we had anticipated”.“The Italian measures — and the possibility that other parts of Europe may move in the same direction in coming weeks — are likely to weigh significantly further on confidence in the near term,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe bank predicted Italy’s economy would contract by 1.2 per cent by the end of the 2020, and said its forecasts for the next few months would be “shaped much more by the coronavirus epidemic than by economic fundamentals or shifts in monetary or fiscal policy”.France’s central bank said it expected the country’s economy to barely grow in the first quarter of the year, cutting its GDP forecast from 0.3 per cent 0.1 per cent.Coronavirus could tip Europe into recession, OECD warnsThe country’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Europe needed a “call to arms” to defend the already weakened economy from an outbreak that has disrupted companies’ supply chains, forced airlines to cut capacity and prompted shoppers in some countries to stockpile food.The downbeat assessments made for a grim start to the week for European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers, who will meet in Frankfurt this week and may be forced to lower interest rates and step up bond purchases. The US Federal Reserve has already acted, with an unexpected easing last week.The ECB told most of its 3,500-plus staff to work from home on Monday to test how it could cope with a coronavirus shutdown. It has cancelled most of its public events over the next month but said its rate-setting Governing Council meeting would go ahead as scheduled on Thursday.The turmoil in global markets on Monday was deepened by\u0026nbspan all-out oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which has led to stocks and oil prices tanking around the world.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other companies to have tried and failed include Orbcomm and Irdium.Mr Musk said he hoped\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0027s Starlink will be the first successful effort and said it should go live in northern US and Canada later this year.

Calls for leaders to act echo around the globe as the signs of a changing climate become ever more difficult to ignoreFierce wildfires have flared up in numerous countries. The damage being caused is unprecedented: 103 people were killed in wildfires last year in California, one of the places best prepared, best equipped to fight such blazes in the worldEntire towns have been razed. The towns of Redding and Paradise in California were all but eliminated in the 2018 seasonWhile wildfires in Greece (pictured), Australia, Indonesia and many other countries have wrought chaos to infrastructure, economies and cost livesIn Britain, flooding has become commonplace. Extreme downpours in Carlisle in the winter of 2015 saw the previous record flood level being eclipsed by two feetHebden Bridge in West Yorkshire has flooded repeatedly in the past decade, with the worst coming on Christmas Day 2015. Toby Smith of Climate Visuals, an organisation focused on improving how climate change is depicted in the media, says: Extreme weather and flooding, has and will become more frequent due to climate change. An increase in the severity and distribution of press images, reports and media coverage across the nation has localised the issue. It has raised our emotions, perception and personalised the effects and hazards of climate change.Out west in Somerset, floods in 2013 led to entire villages being cut off and isolated for weeksIn summer 2012, intense rain flooded over 8000 properties. In 2013, storms and coastal surges combined catastrophically with elevated sea levels whilst December 2015, was the wettest month ever recorded. Major flooding events continued through the decade with the UK government declaring flooding as one of the nation\u0027s major threats in 2017,  says Mr Smith of Climate VisualsWeather has been more extreme in Britain in recent years. The \u0027Beast from the East\u0027 which arrived in February 2018 brought extraordinarily cold temperatures and high snowfall. Central London (pictured), where the city bustle tends to mean that snow doesn\u0027t even settle, was covered in inches of snow for dayMonths after the cold snap, a heatwave struck Britain, rendering the normally plush green of England\u0027s parks in Summer a parched brown for weeksWorsening droughts in many countries have been disastrous for crop yields and have threatened livestock.

Calls for leaders to act echo around the globe as the signs of a changing climate become ever more difficult to ignoreFierce wildfires have flared up in numerous countries. The damage being caused is unprecedented: 103 people were killed in wildfires last year in California, one of the places best prepared, best equipped to fight such blazes in the worldEntire towns have been razed. The towns of Redding and Paradise in California were all but eliminated in the 2018 seasonWhile wildfires in Greece (pictured), Australia, Indonesia and many other countries have wrought chaos to infrastructure, economies and cost livesIn Britain, flooding has become commonplace. Extreme downpours in Carlisle in the winter of 2015 saw the previous record flood level being eclipsed by two feetHebden Bridge in West Yorkshire has flooded repeatedly in the past decade, with the worst coming on Christmas Day 2015. Toby Smith of Climate Visuals, an organisation focused on improving how climate change is depicted in the media, says: Extreme weather and flooding, has and will become more frequent due to climate change. An increase in the severity and distribution of press images, reports and media coverage across the nation has localised the issue. It has raised our emotions, perception and personalised the effects and hazards of climate change.Out west in Somerset, floods in 2013 led to entire villages being cut off and isolated for weeksIn summer 2012, intense rain flooded over 8000 properties. In 2013, storms and coastal surges combined catastrophically with elevated sea levels whilst December 2015, was the wettest month ever recorded. Major flooding events continued through the decade with the UK government declaring flooding as one of the nation\u0027s major threats in 2017,  says Mr Smith of Climate VisualsWeather has been more extreme in Britain in recent years. The \u0027Beast from the East\u0027 which arrived in February 2018 brought extraordinarily cold temperatures and high snowfall.

The great variance in how well investments are protected from climate risk could leave savers and pension holders out of pocket.“More information is needed to help consumers make informed decisions.

I think it’s also Disney’s first battle epic? It is beautiful \u0026amp absorbing \u0026amp rich \u0026amp empowering. The cast is excellent and Niki Caro’s direction is just breathtaking.”“The cast of Mulan is fantastic in the film,” said another. “There are lots of little moments that nods to the animated that’ll make the fans happy. Very beautiful \u0026amp epic cinematography. It had more fantastical elements than I expected. Overall, a great re-telling of the animated and very fun.”Kelvin Harrison Jr on black excellence, police brutality and TrumpA third added:\u0026nbsp”Mulan is one of the best live-action adaptation of a Disney animated classic. It honours the 1998 film and the ballad by modernising themes of female empowerment and iconic scenes, while also standing out w great cinematography \u0026amp battle sequences are reminiscent of Wuxia epics.”The remake stars Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Jason Scott Lee and Jet Li, and just like the original film it follows a woman who disguises herself as a man to fight in China’s imperial army.Mulan will arrive in UK cinemas on 27 March.

So I have looked at what is the biggest single thing I can do to reduce my carbon footprint and it is to give up red meat.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s as simple as that: you run the figures, that is probably the single biggest thing that any consumer can do tomorrow. Things that you can do instantaneously.Lord Turner added: I think the issue of persuading people to eat significantly less red meat in particular is one that we\u0027re not going to be able to shy away from if we\u0027re serious about a zero carbon economy.He suggested a methane tax could be applied to both imports and domestic production to help address the issue and steer people to alternatives.But Tory MP Ms Baldwin, who sits on the committee, intervened to disagree, telling the economist: I\u0027m increasingly worried that people as influential as yourself, Lord Turner, make these statements about red meat when you think about the difference between sustainably grown cattle and, you know, flying in soya beans from Brazil.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A 2018 study published in the journal Nature by academics at Princeton University found that protein from beef had 73 times the carbon emissions of protein from soya, with 1kg of beef protein having the equivalent carbon emissions of passenger\u0027s return flight between London and New York.\u0026nbspContrary to the MP\u0027s claim, soya beans do not tend to be transported by air as their delivery is not particularly time-sensitive, and surface transport in fact constitutes a relatively small proportion of the carbon emissions of all food.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

The great majority, over 90 per cent.“I think it’s easy to get a perception that if you are older and you get this virus then you’re a goner – absolutely not, the great majority of people will recover from this virus, even if they are in their 80s.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Do it again,” the prime minister said, as he broke into a laugh.The pair then demonstrated an elbow bump greeting before leaving the stage.On Tuesday, Dutch health officials said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country had risen by 61 to 382, with four deaths reported.The mistake has shown the difficulty governments face with attempts to prevent outbreaks of the virus, formally known as Covid-19, which is believed to spread in a similar way to influenza.Last week, the World Health Organisation said it was understood that coronavirus spreads “via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick”.Health officials have advised people to wash their hands often with soap and water, avoid close contact with people who are unwell, and cover their mouth or nose with a tissue or sleeve when coughingsneezing to prevent the spread of the virus.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In January,\u0026nbsphe proposed changing the constitution that would limit the presidency to two terms overall. On face value, that created additional barriers to Mr Putin staying on —\u0026nbspthe solution favoured by most of Russia’s ruling class.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, parliamentarians offered a not-unexpected lifeline to their patron.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesValentina Tereshkova, a former cosmonaut and uber loyal deputy of the ruling party fraction in the State Duma, said changes should be dictated by the will of “the people.” But her opinion was clear: either the term limit should be removed, or reset for Mr Putin.\u0026nbspSpeaker Vyacheslav Volodin convened a 90 minute pause in the parliamentary sitting to “discuss” the proposals. A short while later Mr Putin made the short trip over from the Kremlin to give his reaction.\u0026nbspPutin has US \u0027exactly where he wants us\u0027, says key impeachment witnessTrump accused of threatening elections after interference warningAnyone near germaphobic Putin ‘temperature checked’ for coronavirusHe said he was open to the idea of a further two elections\u0026nbsp—\u0026nbspextending his tenure to his 80s, and comfortably past the previous record innings set by Joseph Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev.\u0026nbsp“It’s a possible option in principle, but on one contrition: if the constitutional court decides that such an amendment will not contravene the constitution,” Mr Putin said. “We aren’t adopting a new constitution, but making significant amendments to it.”\u0026nbspUnder the proposals Mr Putin put forward, appointments to the constitutional court are to be made by the president himself. This is one of several areas that will see presidential power increased.\u0026nbspResetting presidential terms was seen by many experts as the most straightforward way for the president to get around his 2024 problem - but also the most cynical.\u0026nbspIn 2011, Russian public opinion reacted strongly against a similarly transparent manoeuvre. Mr Putin’s return to office in place of Dmitry Medvedev was met with massive street protests that at one point threatened to spiral out of control.\u0026nbspSpeaking at parliament, Mr Putin insisted his aim was to leave a democratic legacy. He would not support removing the term limit in entirety, for example.\u0026nbsp“If the country is to be dynamic, it needs its leaders to change,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only the old, frail and sick, they believe, will die. So there is no need to worry.Let’s park, for now, the fact the virus has already mutated into something more aggressive, which might put more people at risk.We need to listen to the experts not for our own sakes but precisely for those old, frail and sick people in and around our lives.That may mean putting other ­people’s needs before our own. Sadly, that does not come ­naturally to everyone. This is the same mindset that sets some people off bulk-buying food andloo roll.Bulk-buying is the epitome of selfishness — quite the opposite of the spirit that united us during World War Two, when people knew they really were in it together.Stockpiling food takes it away from someone who might need it more. I have faith in the public. And I urge everyone to look at what is happening as an invitation — a challenge to rise to — to work out ways in which we can look after each other a little bit ­better.If you know someone old, frail or sick, find ways to make sure they are OK, rather than thinking: “I’m all right, Jack.”As the coronavirus outbreak ­worsens, Britain’s older generation are expected to be warned to self-isolate and stay at home. So it’s up to all of us to do our bit and visit them now — before social distancing is introduced.Coping with loneliness and isolation is already hard enough for many, so let’s do all we can to show them we care. Meanwhile, follow the advice from Public Health England and protect yourself from getting sick as a way of protecting others.Focus on being a good member of your community, on helping others and being a good neighbour. In that way, perhaps, something positive might yet emerge from a very worrying situation.A recent study found our sense of community spirit is declining, with more than half of those polled admitting they barely say a word to their neighbours and do not feel part of a “good neighbourly community”. Just one in ten volunteers with local groups or charities.What happened to us  How did we become so selfish  This “me, me, me” approach is too prevalent. The cult of the inidual approach has led us to think: “As long as my own nest is feathered, I needn’t care about anyone .”If we want something good to come from all this, let’s pause for thought, change our outlook and start thinking of others before we think of ourselves.A crisis can bring out the best — or the worst — in us. We should work to prioritise kindness and bring out the best in each other. The opposite ups the chances of a crisis becoming a catastrophe.I LOVE the fact Heidi Klum, , is so evidently over the moon about being married to musician Tom Kaulitz,  . . . and he is just as happy.In snaps of the pair having dinner in West Hollywood on Wednesday night, she is beaming with pride.Never mind the -year age gap. They both seem to be having a thoroughly nice time together.THERE is no doubt Megxit has put more pressure on William and Kate to meet the public’s expectations and live their lives in the spotlight.While it’s a huge shame Harry and Meghan felt they had no choice but to leave the country, the Cambridges are stepping up to the plate.On their three-day tour of Ireland they have met hundreds of people and posed for countless selfies during an exhausting itinerary.They have visited mental health charities, met farmers and poured oil on potentially troubled waters by speaking at a reception in Dublin about the “many wrongs” Ireland has suffered and our “complex” shared history.They tried their hand at everything from pulling pints to juggling, all the time with smiles on their faces.Some people think that it must be easy being a royal but I defy anyone to do as much as they do in a day, making people feel at ease in their company and all without grumbling.They make a good team and seem genuinely happy to share their lives with us. They will make a great king and queen.SOBERING findings from the United Nations should give us all pause for thought on International Women’s Day.Nine in ten people around the globe are prejudiced against women, it found.That includes depressing notions such as a university education being more important for men than for women and that blokes are more deserving of the jobswork is scarce.Half of the world’s men AND WOMEN feel that fellas make better political leaders, while more than  per cent feel men make better business executives.It is not wholly surprising, I guess,chaps think that way. But these numbers reflect how a horrying number of women think this way too.I guess this is in part due to the received ideas that have formed the backbone of our culture for far too long. That is something for us all to reflect on and challenge wherever we can from now on.ANY woman over  who feels inadequate looking at the drop-dead gorgeousness of Elizabeth Hurley, , can stop the comparisons.It turns out Liz is human after all. Talking to her old friend Trinny Woodall, Liz revealed that she sleeps in a bra every night to keep her cleavage “high and firm” and keeps gaffer tape in her handbag.Gaffer tape, she says, is the secret to her impressive cleavage when she wears plunging dresses.“I wouldn’t be without it,” she said. “I’m obsessed with it. I use it for everything. I have gaffer-taped my body before and it’s the best. There’s nothing better.”Mind you, Liz also claimed she never exercises. Which just goes to show that much of how we look is down to good fortune . . . and good genes.PERHAPS the best thing about getting married for a second time is this: The pressure to do it any way but your way is OFF.I love the fact that when Kate Garraway renews her vows with husband Derek Draper later this year, she is handing the planning reins for the ceremony to her teenage daughter.What a lovely way for the pair to include her. Although having a -year-old arrange your wedding could be . . . interesting.Some people don’t like the idea of renewing wedding vows. But I think it’s romantic.And since anything goes,my husband Paul and I ever do it, the ceremony will be in Las Vegas . . . with me dressed as Elvis.HOW sad – and how shocking – to read a new report saying hundreds of children died or were victims of abuse and neglect AFTER concerns for their welfare had already been raised with social services.It is incredibly dficult being a social worker. It’s one of the most stressful jobs there is.I sometimes wonder why the extended families of at-risk children are not more involved, often not until its too late.Social workers need more funding, more power to take action and all the training that can be made available to them.Maybe that would encourage more people to go into this vital service.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh James!Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson say the last-minute decision to postpone the film was made “after careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace.”That sounds like the film has been pulled for commercial reasons rather than anything to do with deep concerns about public health.And fair enough — because apart from the makers of hand sanitisers, almost every business is going to take a hard knock from coronavirus.But is putting normal le on hold until the end of the year really the way to deal with coronavirus  Is it ultimately even good for business Struggling luxury car manu-facturer Aston Martin were looking forward to the Bond film boosting their sales — Aston Martin have four cars in Never Say Die — but now the firm will have to navigate most of  without the help of . I had already bought my tickets to see No Time To Die on the day it was scheduled to come out, Thursday, April .Frankly, seeing Ana de Armas as CIA agent Paloma in a cocktail dress slashed to the thigh wielding a semi-automatic felt like just what the doctor ordered in these dficult times.But perhaps the Bond producers are right. Who knows how bad things will be by next month It is possible nobody will feel like going to the pictures at the start of April, not even a hardcore Bond nut like me. This health emergency will get a lot worse before it gets better.But even with the tragic news of the first deaths in the UK, so far we have got off lightly compared with other European countries.Escalation here seems inescapable, evenwe all radically improve our personal hygiene. But whatever happens over the next couple of months, panic will only make it infinitely worse.We must all make our own decisions now about the risks we are prepared to take. But I can’t fight the feeling that James Bond has just wimped out big time.The Queen and  are our most famous British icons, forever linked after their brilliant double-act at the opening of the London  Olympics, when Daniel Craig rocked up at the Palace and the Queenparachuted into the Olympic stadium before the opening ceremony.And it is our -year-old monarch who is showing her nation how to act in the face of coronavirus.With her common sense, her calm and her bravery, the Queen has a lesson for us all. Do everything you can to keep yourself and others safe. But don’t stop living your le.The Queen, I suspect, would approve of Tinder’s advice to users to keep a “social distance” from potential partners.“While we want you to continue to have fun, protecting yourself from the coronavirus is more important,” urges the dating app.That seems like a sensible precaution for all young lovers. More hand sanitiser, darling DOG walker Lucy Hignett, , was understandably shocked and appalled when a parish magazine misprint suggested that her firm, Lead The Way, offered a “dog w***ing” service.Lucy, of Thorndon, Suffolk, said: “It was an absolutely horrendous situation.

The Covid- crisis was born in Wuhan and raises red-flag warnings over the country’s future prosperity and stability.Coronavirus is no joke but I am glad to say the opportunity is all ours. It gives us cover to do things we might never have otherwise dared.New Chancellor Rishi Sunak will use his first Budget on Wednesday to seize that chance with both hands.“We go into this in a very strong position,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr. “We need to make sure we respond at scale to whatever scenario comes our way.”This will be no “safety first” Budget. The coronavirus health emergency provides an option to be bold.It unlocks the Treasury stranglehold on spending, borrowing, infrastructure and, crucially, tax reform.Cash will be unleashed first into the NHS, with food and medical supplies a priority for the sick and elderly, plus emergency welfare for those whose earnings suddenly dry up.But there will also be money for big projects — schools, roads and railways and, with another deluge of rain on its way, a welcome doubling of spending on flood defences to £.BILLION.There will be both tax cuts and rises, but plans for a hike in fuel duty will be ditched, I gather.“Our public finances are in good shape,” the Chancellor insists. “I will lay the foundations for future growth and prosperity, level up the country and spread opportunity.”In other words, what is good for Britain’s physical health is also good for economic well-being.The way the world does business changed abruptly when Beijing celebrated Chinese New Year by shutting down most of the country.Today the “workshop of the world” is silent — with alarming implications for a regime whose authority depends on feeding nearly a fth of the planet’s population.Global giants including Volkswagen and Mercedes in Germany, and Apple in the USA, whose vital supply lines have been severed, are weighing their options.Thanks to Donald Trump’s trade wars, they were already reassessing their reliance on cheap but now unreliable overseas labour. The revival of “Rust Belt” cities and recruitment of local workers back home will accelerate.Others with no interest in capitalism are also finding opportunities.We may look back on those “before and after” satellite images of noxious nitrogen- dioxide clouds over China, and the clear blue skies today, as a turning point.Extinction Rebellion protesters might start digging up turf outside the Chinese Embassy, instead of vandalising Cambridge University.We will also notice a drop in air pollution after the collapse of shipping and plane travel.Ships carry  per cent of world trade but burn the heaviest oil, from the dirtiest dregs of a barrel of crude.Greta Thunberg and her “climate emergency” apostles will pounce on this evidence that we can live on fresh air.More seriously, we may be witnessing the end of globalisation — the spread of interlocking world trade which has raised living standards and spread prosperity for millions.It leaves Britain with the opportunity to pick up some of the slack.Ministers are already encouraging firms to raise productivity by swapping cheap migrant labour for expensive but efficient robot technology.The crisis will also have an impact on negotiations with the European Union.Britain is well placed, as a nimble sovereign nation with its own floating currency, to take advantage of fast-moving developments.We have low inflation, low unemployment, a near-record number in work and strong public finances.For the European Union, with its straitjacket single currency and paralysing regulation, the coronavirus crisis has no upside.Hundreds of firms and zombie banks are near collapse — including German giant Deutsche Bank. A downturn will hit firms and raise unemployment, already double the UK rate.EU negotiator Michel Barnier will soon have to choose — between the danger of a No Deal Brexit in December and the opportunity of a Canada-style arrangement which benefits all sides.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the happiest day collectively I remember experiencing in the UK since the  London Olympics.We backed Prince Harry in his ious good causes like the Invictus Games.And we saluted the daring approach Meghan was making to modernising the Royal Family. I welcomed her approach and had much excitement that she could finish what Princess Diana had started.But there was criticism too. And aside from the vile trolls in that cesspit otherwise known as social media, most of it was fair and balanced.Like, for example, the couple preaching about our carbon footprints and the need to change our behaviour, while taking four private jet flights in  days.They may not have liked it, but they clearly thought about those objections because the couple now claim they will do what they can to fly commercially.There were many objections from within the Royal Family about the couple’s behaviour and demands – and there are two sides to this story.Many courtiers will tell you Harry and Meghan were rude and didn’t respect the hierarchy and pecking order that’s essential for smooth royal operations.But those close to Harry and Meghan have a very dferent perspective. They’ve told me that the couple felt they were under attack by royal staff members and other households from day one.We worried about the obvious changes to Harry, who went from happy go lucky to angry and brittle.We also questioned why so many of Meghan’s old friends and family members – including her own father Thomas – were no longer in her le.From a personal perspective, I value my school friends and blood relatives more than anyone  because they’ve known me for so long and know how to bring me down to earth whenever that might be required.But those small criticisms pale into insignicance when you compare the column inches and media coverage devoted to the issues that Harry and Meghan care about.Watching Meghan on stage at Robert Clack School in Dagenham working the crowd of teenagers like a true Hollywood princess, it’s very obvious the Royal Family are about to lose a superstar – and no one is celebrating that.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I see this for myself in my home town of Margate, where the rows of boarded up shops in the centre create a mood of permanent despair.In fact, for all the recent talk of regeneration in the Kent coastal town, it remains in the top one per cent of most deprived neighbourhoods in England.In the wake of Coronavirus, the Chancellor this week must take steps to ensure that businesses can stillthrough the crisis.Among the measures he should consider is a temporary suspension in VAT or employers’ national insurance so firms don’t suddenly run out of cash.He might also introduce a scheme whereby tax payments could be spread out over a longer period.Butthe roots of a retail revival are to go deeper, then the Conservative government will have to embark on genuine reform of business rates, which are currently penalising too many retailers.“Business rates are having a catastrophic effect on the high street. The system we have got at the moment is absolute lunacy,” says Tony Brown, the former chief executive of the retail chain Beales, which is now being closed with the loss of , jobs.As Mr Brown points out, in some cases the rates bill for a Beales store was  times as much as the rent, an unsustainable position.In this second decade of the st century, the Government is meant to be encouraging enterprise, but this mismanaged, unjust system does the exact opposite.As the commercial equivalent of the council tax, the unorm business rate — which is set by central government but collected by local authorities — is a levy paid by companies, supposedly based on the notional rental value of the premises they occupy.But it has become badly distorted by continual tinkering and changes in retail practices.Ministers still like it because it brings in a large amount of revenue, over £billion-a-year, and it is dficult to avoid.But it is riddled with absurdities and inconsistencies.For a start, it bears no relationship to how a retail business is performing.As John Webber, head of ratings at Colliers International global estate services company, puts it, “retailers are paying a disproportionate slice of UK business rate bills, and this burden is based purely on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing.”In addition, it is a tax that punishes high street firms while favouring cyberspace and out-of-town operators with far cheaper premises.In a justiably angry recent outburst, James Daunt, the head of the Watersones book chain, complained that the business rates system is “hollowing out the high street” and shting work “to God-awful warehouses.In a classic example of this destructive bias, the business rates bill for Amazon in  was just £.million, despite UK sales of nearly £.billion.Yet the fashion chain Next, with  stores, had to pay a business rates bill almost £million more than Amazon.The trouble doesnt end there.Businesses with a property of a rateable value of less than £, are eligible for  per cent tax relief, whereas stores with a property value of over £, get no relief at all.In addition, firms can be hurt by transitional relief, which is meant to act like a shock-absorber in gradually phasing in changes in the size of tax bills after any revaluation of properties.Transitional relief might be beneficial when rental values are rising because it gives business ratepayers several years to adjust to increases.But since the last valuation in , retail firms increasingly inhabit a world where commercial rents are falling.Because transitional relief also slows down reductions in bills, this means that many businesses are now paying far more than they really should, given the lower values of their properties.In one branch of Poundland in Blackpool, for example, the business rate should have fallen by  per cent between  and  because of the drop in rental values.Instead, misnamed transitional relief means that by  it will have gone down in real terms by only  per cent.“Transitional relief  I call it comic relief. It needs to be scrapped,” says Poundland’s boss Barry Williams.The Government has tinkered with business rates for years, but all this has achieved is more frustration and complexity.Real reform is needed so that the spirit of enterprise is rewarded rather than punished.Buoyed by their recent election result, the Tories talk about “levelling up the economy” through major infrastructure projects and new transport links.Butthey really want to make an immediate dference, they will focus on helping our high streets.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On housing we have taken a step back, generationally.Whereas my family could be certain of a secure home with a rent we could afford, too many young people today will never know what a stable foundation like that can do for them.A proper home lets people get on with their lives, get their children into a good school, start a business, get involved in the community.These are great British traits that the Conservative Party should be fighting for every day. After all, we created Right To Buy, which has been a great source of stability and mobility for millions, and a triumph of Tory values.However, we now need to reorient the policy so the great opportunities we continue to offer to people with Right To Buy are more than matched by building new social housing to replace what we sell.This is importantwe want to give more people the same chance I had. Shelter recently found there was a net loss of , council houses last year as a result of demolitions and properties sold off through Right To Buy.This is happening while thousands of hard-working families sit on social housing waiting lists, desperate for a shot at the stability they cannot find anywhere .Runaway house prices mean owning your own home has become a distant dream for many lower-paid workers — receptionists, hospital porters, teaching assistants.These hard-working people still deserve a secure home. In the past  years alone house prices in England have grown at twice the pace of wages.The average home increased in value by  per cent between  and , while wages only grew by  per cent.Investing in social housing should be a deeply Conservative ideal. It gives people a  on which to build their lives, to progress and to grow. It is an essential element of a society that values social mobility.After all, it was a Conservative-led council in Liverpool that built the first ever council house as far back as .At last year’s General Election, people up and down the country, many from poorer backgrounds and living in social housing, put their trust in the Conservative Party to deliver for them.If our policies simply continue to provide only expensive new-builds for the already well-off, and almost unaffordable rents for the rest, then people might be left wonderingthat trust was misplaced.By building up our nation’s social housing and ensuring there is sufficient stock of affordable homes, we can give people a chance of a good home and deliver on our promises of fairness and aspiration.There is a world of dference between my childhood home and the grim high-rises that have come to define social housing for many today.But done right, new social housing can create thriving community hubs, minimise crime and be as appealing as new garden villages and towns. You need only to look at Goldsmith Street, the award-winning new development in Norwich, to know this vision is achievable.But warm words alone won’t build good-quality, affordable homes. We need money to build, and the Budget is a chance to signal the party is serious about tackling housing inequality head on.I’ve led a group of  fellow Conservative MPs from across the country and one Conservative metro mayor to call on the Chancellor to let our voters know whose side we are on. We have sent him a letter, an edited version of which is above.Many of us have felt the benefits of social housing in our own lives and we want the next generation to have the same shot at success we did. I hope our new Chancellor listens to our call in his Budget.A secure home lets people get on with their lives, look after their families and grow their businesses without having to worry about damp and draughts damaging their children’s health or a sudden hike in rent ending their dreams.Ensuring this means building up our nation’s offer of social homes. This has been ignored for too many decades. If our policies simply continue to provide only unaffordable housing, the people will never forgive us.However,we are the party that finally delivers the social and other high-quality affordable housing this country needs, they will never forget us.We need the money to build and renovate our available stock, and reform of the planning and laws around land to make it easier to get the social homes built.We believe this year’s Budget is the chance to signal that we will be serious about making this happen.Yours sincerely, DavidOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s been under Aprican rule ever since.”Immediate consequences seem to be a dramatic improvement in the weather, everyone in London is now dressed like Graham Norton and there’s a ban on black people and white people holding hands on buses.Love can breach the racial ide, though. Callum, a white nought, played by Jack Rowan, has fallen for Masali Baduza’s Sephy, the black daughter of the Home Secretary.This all plays well, obviously, to the self-loathing Empire guilt of the BBC and a lot of middle-class newspapers, who’ve described it as “timely”, “vital” and even claimed: “Noughts + Crosses’ world is our world.”I don’t know what part of Britain they live in where black and white people are banned from holding hands on buses but, lets set aside the show’s political agenda for a moment.The thing about Noughts + Crosses is that, for both technical and artistic reasons, it doesn’t work particularly well as a drama.The story is, of course, as solid as the day William Shakespeare wrote Romeo  Juliet, but the visual problems start with the fact that, because it was filmed in Cape Town, there appears to be a dirty great mountain hovering above what I think is meant to be Tilbury.The obvious climate issue also means poor Helen Baxendale, who plays Callum’s servant mum Maggie, is left with the gear change when she suddenly has to hold up her boss’s dress and say: “Beautul isn’t it . . . and so is the weather.”“Yes, finally some sunshine, You might even catch some colour.”Ker-unch. I’m also not buying the central relationship between Sephy and Callum, which is marked by a distinct lack of sexual chemistry, or the idea he qualied for the elite military school after one weekend on an assault course.The real issue you cannot ignore, however, is the political baggage. If Noughts + Crosses had been screened  or even  years ago, it would’ve been sensational.In , though, TV is overwhelmed by shows and voices telling us everything is racist and sexist, so it just felt and looked like the slowest-moving episode of Doctor Who ever.I find it particularly galling that a lot of those siren voices belong to journalists who I know will be out of a job the day they stop pretending modern-day Britain is really no dferent from Third Reich Germany in .It shouldn’t blind us to our own country’s faults, though.I can, for instance, think of a very prominent British institution that’s had nothing but white, male Director Generals since it was created in .The BBC, though, has always been better at pointing the finger at others rather than itself.So until such time as TV realises less is more, I fully expect Noughts + Crosses to be given awards, acclaim and further series, while a great chunk of television’s weary audience shrugs: “Yeah, everything is racist. We know.”THE heart now sinks every time the lt doors open at The Sex Clinic, on E, and out pops another human horror story like “fabulous fairy” Hugo.His description, not mine. And based on what  I’ve absolutely no idea.But apparently Hugo can have anything up to “three or four men a day”, while he describes his sex le as “very fast-forward”.So I took the hint and skipped through his bits at x speed.The trouble with The Sex Clinic, though, is there’s no light at the end of the tunnel – just more patients like free-wheeling Esther, from Wigan, who shocked me to the core by announcing: “I do not want to jump from d**k to d**k like Tarzan.”’Cos I’d no idea Tarzan was even gay.Although it’s Jane I actually feel sorry for, obviously.Beth England: “Getting on flights brought me back down to earth.”GOOD Morning Britain “megafauna” Piers Morgan: “A lot of people say I look like a young Roger Moore.”BBC continuity: “Now you’re in for a treat. Miriam Margolyes on The One Show.”The Sex Clinic, Esther: “I’d say my sex le is very spontaneous.”Lonely, desolate, unfulfilled, messy, abandoned, solitary, forlorn, a cry for help and all those other things Vanessa Feltz once scrawled on a Celebrity Big Brother table.And why hasn’t Sharon ­listened to Denny’s phone message incriminating Ian  It really would speed this storyline along a bit.WORLD heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury could quite easily have become the most intimidating oaf on the planet.The fact he didn’t and is a surprisingly endearing figure owes something to his continued attachment to home town Morecambe, in Lancashire, and its rubbish disposal unit, which, Tyson explained last Thursday, he faithfully visits “twice a week”, while also taking the car for a mini-valet on a Monday and: “Shaving me head.”It’s a devotion dwarfed only by Tyson’s love for his five children, three of whom are called Prince, and heroic we, Paris, who endures his mood swings and singing with a resolve that would put a few of his opponents to shame.All of which made him the perfect subject for ITV’s fly-on-the-wall documentary Tyson Fury: The Gypsy King, a three-part dream of a series which came to a thrilling and touching conclusion last Thursday, with footage of his win over Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas.Victory was followed by a slightly baffling chorus of American Pie before Tyson grabbed the first available phone to speak to his terrying dad, John, who’d been forced to watch the fight back in England, for GBH-related reasons.Only one question seemed to matter by that stage. “Did I look good on the telly, Dad ” Outstanding, Tyson, son.

And you can get sick.”The infectious disease specialist added that germs going into the mouth is “the easiest way you can contract any infection.Purvi continued: “There are so many infections going around this time of year, from bacterial to viral to the flu.But then on top of that, given that we now have this coronavirus, there’s even more reason not to bite your nails.”The best way to prevent the spread of coronavirus is to wash your hands, public health officials have said.People are instead urged to wash their hands with soap and water for  seconds instead.Public Health England has launched an awareness campaign reminding people to wash their hands when:Coronavirus is understood to be spreading through droplets from coughs and sneezes.So touching surfaces where these droplets may have landed means you could easily pick it up.You should also cough or sneeze into tissues before binning them.Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: We all have a role to play in stopping this disease.Washing hands regularly is the single most important thing that an inidual can do.Public safety remains our top priority. The government and the NHS are working   to fight this virus.It’s imperative that everyone follows clinical advice by contacting NHS , and not going to AEyou develop symptoms.It comes as new research found that coronavirus symptoms could between five and  days to show.And in some rare cases symptoms can still appear after the quarantine period of  days, experts have said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The annual statement on your pay, pensions, taxes and more was derailed when Sajid Javid quit as Chancellor in a political row with  Downing Street. But novice Chancellor Rishi Sunak decided to press on with the date of Wednesday  March. Now, however, the usual focus of the statement will be knocked off course by the onset of the coronavirus in the UK. No insiders insist the Budget will not downgrade spending plans, despite the COVID- virus sending stock markets plummeting. But it will have extra measures to deal with the virus.  Meanwhile the age-old contentious funding issues of social care, benefits poverty and cash-strapped schools are likely to bubble along without the usual scrutiny. So what is the Budget, why is it so important and what might it mean for your money  All the latest predictions and information are below.What is the Budget  A statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on his plans for tax, public spending and economic forecasts. It sets key duties on fuel, cigarettes and alcohol as well as the minimum wage. MPs vote on whether to accept it. In past times this would be a controversial vote, but Boris Johnson has a majority of  so itaposs almost guaranteed to pass. When is the Budget   The Budget is at .pm in the House of Commons on Wednesday  March. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs speech is expected to take about an hour, packed full of massively important announcements and more than a little political point-scoring. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will then respond to the Budget. It is the first Budget since October . There have been a spring statement and a aposspending roundapos since then, but these are less far-reaching than the Budget. How will Coronavirus affect the Budget   Coronavirus will, without doubt, affect the Budget. And not just the fact itaposs sent stock markets tumbling - thereaposs also the fact of dealing with the outbreak. Itaposs not yet knownthere will be cash for the hard-pressed NHS. Officials argue cash is not the only factor, and the NHS has already been given a boost under Boris Johnson . When it comes to business disruption, however, it looks like weaposll see something. Ministers have already expanded sick pay to the first day people are off sick, not the fourth. But unions say it must go further by applying to the low-waged and self-employed who arenapost eligible. An official suggested the Budget may well go further, saying the self-employed were lucky there’s a budget on Wednesday and telling Playbook: People would expect us to put measures in place to help public services, businesses and - yes - iniduals.” Meanwhile, the Chancellor has said he is ready to take targeted measures to help businesses get through the coronavirus outbreak. Rishi Sunak suggested his financial plan would now focus on the economic security of the country, as he warned that the economy could suffer a supply shocklots of people fall ill. Mr Sunak, who has been in office for less than a month, said: We need to look at what are the interventions that we need to help bridge a dficult period.Thataposs where we might look at some targeted options to help ease the strain on cash flows for a certain period to help them get through to the other side. Obviously, alongside the supply shock there will likely be an impact on demandpeople are at home.  Minimum wage The minimum wage for over-s will rise by p to £. an hour from April. It will also rise to £. , £. , £.and £. . Normally the Budget might be the first time we find out about these rises, but this yearaposs is being held unusually close to April  so itaposs already been announced. Inheritance Tax The Tories have repeatedly cut Inheritance Tax, to the point you can now leave £, to your relatives tax-free . From April  that is due to hit £,, making the tax-free sum for married couples a cool £million. National Insurance From April, you will pay no national insurance contributions on the first £, of your earnings - up from £, at the moment - working out as a saving of around £ a year. The move has been criticised for falling short of the £-a-year Boris Johnson promised, and only helping better earners who are already over the threshold. Meanwhile, the Chancellor will also raise the Employment Allowance - the amount employers can get off their overall National Insurance bill - from £, to £, per year. But the eligibility criteria is being tightened at the same time - only firms with a Class  National Insurance bill below £, can qualy. End of the tampon tax  The government is expected to abolish the % VAT charged on womenaposs sanitary products during the Budget, with a zero rate of VAT applying from the start of next year. The Treasury estimates the move will save the average woman nearly £ over her letime, with a cut of p on a pack of  tampons and p on  pads. But since  the money raised by the hated charge on tampons and sanitary towels, which couldnapost be abolished while the UK was in the EU, has been used to fund a charity pot for womenaposs groups. Charities say the money for that should keep rolling in.  Flood defence funding doubled Funding for flood defences is expected to be doubled to £. billion. The investment will help to build , new flood and coastal defence schemes and better protect , properties in England over the next six years. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said communities in Britain have been hit hard by severe flooding this winter, saying it is right that we invest to protect towns, families, and homes across the UK. The funding - which doubles the £. billion spent on flood defences between  and  - is expected to be targeted in every region, and will be available from next April. It comes after Boris Johnson was slammed for not visiting flood victims quickly enough. Superfast broadband  A £ billion by  programme of super-fast broadband will be announced in the Budget. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will confirm the plan in Wednesdayaposs Budget speech - alongside a £ billion deal to boost G mobile phone signal across the country. The deal will provide extra coverage to , premises and ,km of roads, the Treasury said.  Changes to parental leave for parents with sick babies Parents of sick newborn babies will be able to claim a new neonatal pay and leave entitlement under measures set to be announced by the Chancellor. Rishi Sunak will outline plans to allow new mothers and fathers to claim statutory paid leave for every week their child is in neonatal care, up to a maximum of  weeks, when he delivers his first Budget on Wednesday. Treasury Minister Kemi Badenoch said the cost of the leave - to be paid at a rate of around £ per week - would almost entirely be incurred by the Government, rather than business. Growth forecasts - but they may be out of date  The Budget will provide forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility on GDP growth, debt and borrowing for the next five or so years. All in Westminster will be watching closely to see how these compare to the previous forecasts in . But thereaposs an added element this year - the OBR inevitably takes some time to put its projections together, so they may be out of date due to the rapid effect of the coronavirus.Changes to the aposGreen Bookapos and possibly more borrowing Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirmed: I will be on Wednesday outlining a review of what we called the Green Book. This is the manual that the government uses to allocate investment and make investment decisions. This could re-weight spending to the north. Meanwhile, crucially, the Chancellor hasnapost rule out rewriting aposfiscal rulesapos to allow him to borrow for day-to-day spending. Domestic abuse courts  Special domestic abuse courts where criminal offences are heard alongside family law cases will be set up under a £million trial to be unveiled in the Budget. Chancellor Rishi Sunak plans to announce millions of pounds to crackdown on domestic abuse when he delivers his first Budget on Wednesday. Measures include £million to tackle “high-risk, high-harm perpetrators of domestic abuse through early interventions”. Another move will see £million pledged to pilot domestic abuse courts, which will hear family and criminal matters in parallel. The Treasury believes the plan will offer victims better support. Another £million is designed to improve sex assault victims’ experiences in the justice system. Hundreds of Treasury staff in the North, Wales and Northern Ireland Mr Sunak said a fth of Treasury staff would soon be based outside London. He told the BBC: We will be opening a new economic campus in the north of England, and also opening offices for the first time in Wales and Northern Ireland. Protecting the future of cash Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to commit to new laws protecting the future of cash in the Budget. The moves will aim to ensure that people who rely on cash, including vulnerable groups and local communities across the UK, can access it as and when they need it. The Treasury is expected to start talks with the industry and regulators - the Bank of England, Financial Conduct Authority and Payment Systems Regulator - around legislation immediately after the March  Budget. £bn of export loans The Chancellor will attempt to boost exports with £bn of loans through UK Export Finance - raising its lending from £bn to £bn in total. From the new pot, £bn will be offered for exports that encourage green growth and another £bn will go to the defence industry. The pot includes cross-government support including multiple departments. Budget  predictions Fuel duty  Fuel duty has been kept at .p per litre for petrol and diesel since . Last yearaposs freeze alone will cost the Treasury more than £billion over five years. Rumours have abounded that, finally, the rate will be raised. But that would likely prompt a Tory revolt. More than a dozen newly-elected aposblue-collarapos MPs warned clobbering working-class car drivers will send the wrong message about this Government’s priorities. Stamp Duty  The Budget could enact Boris Johnsonaposs manesto pledge to slap a % Stamp Duty surcharge on homes - when theyaposre bought by foreign buyers. The move was designed to deter precious homes in the UK being snapped up as investments for profit. According to the Financial Times, the final rate could end up lower than % to reflect concern from property industry lobbyists. One buying agent complained it would penalise millionaires and slow down efforts to get the economy moving. Entrepreneursapos relief  The Tory manesto vowed to review and reform entrepreneursapos relief - a £bn tax break that reduces Capital Gains Tax for people selling their business. But business lobby groups were angry at rumours the relief could be scrapped altogether. The Federation of Small Businesses said it would destroy the retirements of thousands of business owners. Labour on the other hand backed ending the relief, saying: We said we would scrap the relief but turn it into a grant because then you would then get the productivity gains that everyone needs. Northern infrastructure  Boris Johnson won a sweep of aposred wallapos northern and Midlands seats in the general election. He has repeatedly promised to repay votersapos trust with a string of big infrastructure projects. Expect the Budget to make a big political play of help to these areas, despite the headwinds of Coronavirus. But the devil will be in the detail. Will the Chancellor announce hard cash or will he merely announce aposreviewsapos and consultations with the promise of jam tomorrow  Cigarettes and alcohol  Itaposs common for the Budget to put another penny or two on sin taxes - including cigarettes and alcohol. Final rates are confirmed on Budget Day and usually apply from that evening - prompting some to make a quick rush to the shops. Income Tax The Budget is the traditional time to make changes to Income Tax. In Labouraposs day this revolved around introducing new rates for higher earners. Since  the focus has been on raising the tax-free personal allowance, which now stands at £,.

Still I’d marvel at the kind of thing my mum and dad could knock up with fewer ingredients than most people had at the start of this crisis.

Ex-Tory leader Sir Iain also renewed calls for the five-week wait for payment to be cut to four and demanded claimants are saved from billions of pounds in debt repayments. Sir Iain resigned in protest at Tory welfare cuts in  - after proudly presiding over them for six years as Work and Pensions Secretary. Although he resigned over disability benefit, he has since also slammed ex-Chancellor George Osborne for making huge cuts before UC was set up. Despite the government making a string of U-turns to make UC more generous - with run-on housing payments, longer debt repayment periods and a shorter wait for payment - Sir Iain said last night it has still not gone far enough.Defending his system overall, he told the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee: There is no question in my mind that Universal Credit is better than the benefits that went before.And he condemned political rivals for using the most vulnerable to stir up an argument. But he added: I resigned over the fact that the government withdrew money at the time we were trying to roll it out, which was a big mistake. Now the government has sought to put most of that money back - there’s still some more to go.Last year the government admitted , people on UC were having old Tax Credit debts deducted from their benefit payment. The overpayments were racked up - sometimes through no fault of their own - before claimants were moved from a HM Revenue and Customs system to the Department for Work and Pensions . At the time the average debt was £,with struggling families losing up to % of their UC each month.Sir Iain said: The number one thing I would do is get rid of the debt that is coming across unnecessarily from Tax Credit. “I did ask the DWP the other day what is the number one thing that you’re concerned about. The number one thing is HMRC have been unable to get this debt back. Sir Iain said he opposed piling the debt onto UC claimants at the time, but I had to cave in on that eventually because I was under pressure across the board.

The Cabinet Secretary, who is in charge of the civil service, said he would have had conversations with the Prime Minister about Cabinet appointees - but refused to comment on an inidual case. Sir Mark even suggested he could withhold this informationhe is demanded to produce it as part of an employment tribunal - which is expected after Ms Patelaposs top official quit in a blaze of bullying claims. Ms Patel has denied claims about her behaviour from workers in three departments since Philip Rutnam, permanent secretary at the Home Office, resigned and vowed to bring a tribunal. That tribunal could, in theory, question Ms Patel or the government on the wider complaints against her - including one incident which is said to have happened when she was employment minister. But Sir Mark told MPs on the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee: My advice to the Prime Minister is always private and we never, ever get into specics “Of course when the Prime Minister is considering appointments, part of my role is to give them advice I can on my knowledge of the iniduals they’re considering appointing across the range. “But I don’t want to be more specic than that. You’ll understand that’s always a private matter between the Cabinet Secretary of the day and the Prime Minister of the day.”  Askedthe information would still be privatehe was asked at an employment tribunal, Sir Mark said: “I don’t know, I’d have to seek legal advice of legal counsel in those circumstances. But I would not expect private advice between then Cabinet Secretary and the Prime Minister to be subject to that kind of proceeding. We’ll have to see. Downing Street has refused to say whether it knew of any complaint against Ms Patel before she was made Home Secretary last summer. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman claimed commenting could prejudice a legal case. The Cabinet Office is carrying out an internal inquiry into allegations against Ms Patel. But the Prime Minister has rowed in behind her before it even finishes, saying Iaposm sticking by her and adding: The Home Secretary is doing a fantastic job - I have every confidence in her. Sir Mark said he regretted Philip Rutnamaposs resignation but there was no need to overhaul bullying rules.  He told MPs: This is clearly a very regrettable incident. I regret Philip Rutnamaposs decision to resign and hoped it could have been avoided. And we have to allow that case and indeed the other investigations to take their course. I don’t think we should necessarily be trying to write further regulations around relationships that in the vast majority of cases are conducted professionally and in accordance with both the letter and the spirits of the ious codes. There are tensions and dficulties - we deal with those when they arise.  In general I think the mechanisms we have available to us are adequate to the task. “And our expectation is that senior and experienced professional people conduct professional relationships with each other.

British Airways, Ryanair and Wizz have all shut off their routes to Italy for several weeks, after the Foreign Office warned against all but essential advice. But some Brits due to fly out for holidays to Italy this week are still set to lose money. EasyJet has cancelled flights to northern Italy but other routes are still running. It currently is not planning to refund or rebook customers on existing flights to Italy that havenapost been cancelled.Ryanair had initially also refused to refund customers but this afternoon annonced it was suspending flights to Italy and offering refunds in some cases.But the airlineaposs decision has left some travellers with holidays booked this week in the lurch - as they learn the refunds only kick in from Friday despite Italy being in lockdown. Italy is under blanket quarantine conditions as authorities working to contain the virus grapple with a rising death toll in the country. The Foreign Office has warned Brits against all but essential travel to Italy as the outbreak takes its grip. Travel chaos is in store for Brits are left wondering what to do, as many flights between the UK and Italy are being cancelled while others are continuing to operate. Ryanair had earlier told customers whose flights are running that the no cancellation and no refund policy remains. However at lunchtime today the airline issued a fresh statement revising its position. The airline said it will be suspending Italian domestic flights from midnight on Wednesday March , and all Italian international flights from midnight on Friday March . The airline said that affected passengers have been contacted by email regarding the cancellations.As for passengers looking for repatriation, Ryanair is offering a free move to an earlier one of its flights operating until midnight on Friday March .Affected passengers will be able to choose between a full refund or a travel credit that can be redeemed on Ryanair flights in the next  months.  But travellers who had holidays booked for this week have been left with no option of a refundthey donapost want to travel.

Ryanairaposs new stance on Italy flights announced this afternoon leave the coupleaposs trip falling just outside the airlineaposs offer for affected travellers by a single day. Mr Lawrence told thehad already spent more than an hour on hold to the airline this morning in hopes of finding a solution, but said his hopes were fading with just days before they were due to fly. He said: It’s absolutely ridiculous. How can you continue to run flights to a country on lockdown without offering a refund  To some extent you know what you are getting in to when you book with a low-cost airline but this is way beyond the line. Scandalous.” He said the coupleaposs flights with the budget airline had cost about £, but it was the principle of the matter that left them feeling frustrated as he said other travel operators had acted fairly.  Mr Lawrence said the coupleaposs Airbnb host in Florence had offered the couple a full refund even before north Italyaposs quarantine extended to the rest of the country. Airbnb had also waived its fees, Mr Lawrence said. Travel chaos The situation in Italy has brought fresh travel chaos after struggling airline Flybe folded last week, partly blaming the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on its plight.

The number of confirmed cases in the UK has increased by , bringing the current total to , with a sixth person dying from the virus. The UK governmentaposs chief medical adviser has said that people who show even minor signs of the virus - dficulty breathing, fever and a dry cough - should self-isolate for  days. In a bid to help employees adapt to working at home, author, speaker and scientist Emily Lakdawalla asked those who are experienced at working at home to share their tips - and they didnapost disappoint. She said: Friends, there are going to be a lot of people newly working from home starting this week, and it will be a dficult transition for some. And it didnapost take long for people to share their tips and ideas - all of which will be very helpfulyouaposve had an email saying youaposre now allowed in the office. Many stressed how important it is to avoid working from your bed, regardless of how tempting it may be. Laying or even sitting on your bed tricks your mind into thinking itaposs nap time, no matter how productive youaposre feeling - itaposll also wreck your posture too. Instead, sit at a table in another room - butthataposs not possible, try to make your bedroom as light, bright and airy as possible.  Act asit is a normal work day - donapost just pour a cup of coffee and sit in your pyjamas all day. Prepare for the day as you would any other. Youaposll feel less lethargic, your brain will be more active and thereaposs less chance that youaposll procrastinate.  One person said: I think the best tip I can offer is get up and get dress asyou were going to follow your regular schedule . And, donapost feel guilty for taking a short break when you feel you need it. Weaposre not saying watch an entire episode of your latest Netflix binge, but do take a short walk, have a shower, read a book, anything except scrolling on your phone.But, some experts have highlighted the importance of having a routine, with person saying: That marks the end of the working day to replace your commute. You need and deserve to aposswitch offapos again. Another person said: This is a very important consideration. It can be hard to decompress at end of day when WFH . Recommend having a set stop time, then a walk, workout, or errands.  A third also suggested: Go for a   mile walk before you sit down to start, andpossible, come in by the backdoor. That way it feels like youaposre going to work, not your house . Also turn social media off for  hours at a time. And, for those with children, one mum said: It is crucial that both you AND ESPECIALLY your spouse partner understand that though you are working from home, you are at work and can not be expected to do household chores, pick up after kids, etc. "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus londons tubes given enhanced","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Londons Tubes given enhanced cleaning in bid to fight spreadThe London Underground and Transport for Londons bus networks will be disinfected more regularly than usual as the capital mounts its coronavirus defence with  positive tests in the cityShareCommentsByNeil Lancefield:,  MAR NewsTransport for London is trialling new, longer-lasting cleaning fluid due to the outbreak \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The study says infected iniduals should expect to begin feeling unwell within  days - although in rare cases the incubation period can last longer, reports Devon Live. The findings support current recommendations introduced in countries including the UK to isolate those who may have been exposed to Covid- for  days.

Brits are being warned to avoid all but essential travel to the country, as the death toll climbs. Study senior author professor Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US, said: Based on our analysis of publicly available data, the current recommendation of  days for active monitoring or quarantine is reasonable.  But he added: With that period some cases would be missed over the long-term. The latest study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine - the most extensive of its kind - analysed  provinces, regions and countries outside Wuhan, China, where the disease emerged. It reviewed news reports, public health papers and press releases to estimate theof time from exposure to the onset of symptoms. The US team found information on  confirmed cases prior to  February where incubation windows could be identied - the time from exposure to symptom onset. They said: Most involved travel to or from Wuhan, China, the city at the centre of the epidemic, or exposure to iniduals who had been to Hubei, the province for which Wuhan is the capital.  This enabled them to estimate an average period of . days. Current understanding of this has been limited. Prof Lessler said: Human coronaviruses that cause common colds have mean illness-incubation periods of about three days. Almost allpatients appeared to develop symptoms within . days of infection. Prof Lessler said: These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, only  out of every , cases will develop symptoms after  days of active monitoring or quarantine, which supports current CDC recommendations. The US Centres for Disease Control and Preventionadvises active monitoring of people for  days after an assumed exposure to COVID-.  Many other authorities around the world - including Public Health England - have been using the same guide for those known to be at high risk of infection due to contact with patients or travel to a heavily affected area. The illness usually spreads through droplets of saliva or mucus carried in the air for up to six feet or so when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Viral particles may be breathed in, land on surfaces that people touch or be transferred when shaking hands or sharing a drink with someone who has the virus. Often itaposs obviousa person is unwell. But there are cases where those who do not feel sick pass it on. Exactly how this happens - and how often - is not yet known.  Regular handwashing and avoiding touching your mouth, nose and eyes are likely to help stop the spread of the virus. Quarantines and travel restrictions are now in place in many counties - including the US. COVID- is largely a respiratory virus. Common symptoms include a fever, dry coughing and trouble breathing. But there have been some reports of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. In some cases it can cause pneumonia and potentially be le-threatening. Most people who get sick will recover from COVID-. Recovery time ies and, for people who are not severely ill, may be similar to the aftermath of flu. People with mild symptoms may recover within a few days. It may take weeks or even months for those who develop pneumonia. Prof Lessler added: An accurate estimate of the disease incubation period for a new virus makes it easier for epidemiologists to gauge the likely dynamics of the outbreak, and allows public health officials to design effective quarantine and other control measures.

One was passion and physical attraction, one was friendship and fun, one stability and familiarity, she said. But the affairs ended in heartbreak when one of her lovers murdered the other in a chilling revenge attack.Natalie was having secret affairs with both Alan Maidment, , and Tom Jones,  – at the same time as she was sleeping with her husband.But after Jones attacked Natalie, Maidment murdered him in revenge, stabbing him repeatedly before setting his body on fire. Maidment was jailed for le without parole in October . And an independent review, published this week, has found that lessons from the case could still be learned. Natalie, , from Salford, says: “I actually introduced the two men to each other and I feel so guilty.“I never set out to sleep with them all at the same time it was just circumstance. They all lived so close and it was amazing that I got away with it. “Each lover brought me something dferent one was passion and physical attraction, one was friendship and fun, one stability and familiarity.“I was arrested on suspicion of murder after Tom’s death and in court, Alan even tried to blame me himself. “I didn’t know about the review but it has brought all the trauma back to me. “I am very lucky in that my husband has supported me and I’m back living in the family home. I hope we can work this out.“But the flat where Tom died is across the road and so I see it, every time I leave the house. It’s a constant reminder. I’ve had a backlash from the community too, some people somehow blame me. It’s been a struggle to cope, and this review brings it all back.”Natalie was on a temporary split from her husband, Paul, when she met Alan Maidment in July .Natalie says: “Paul and I had been together for eighteen years, mostly happy. But I was drinking too much and we went through a rocky patch. We decided on a break and I met Alan, firstly just as a friend, but then we got closer.”At the start of , Natalie believed she needed a fresh start and moved into her own place, around the corner from her husband. Alan moved away and she began seeing a neighbour, Tom Jones.She says: “We were just friends at first. My relationship with Alan petered out because I hardly saw him. He lived around  minutes away.“One night, after a few drinks, I ended up in bed with Tom and from then on, we started sleeping together. We weren’t in a serious relationship more friends with benefits. We shared a flat and we shared a bed. “I knew it wasn’t the best situation but I certainly didn’t think it would lead to his death.” Alan then decided to move closer to Natalie – and got a flat just a few streets away.Natalie says: “Alan didn’t know I had been sleeping with Tom. He moved in near me and our relationship resumed. I didn’t know how to tell him about Tom so I just kept quiet.“I was sleeping with both men.” Natalie also slept with her husband during that time, in an attempt to rescue her marriage.She says: “I was very confused I didn’t know what I wanted. I had three men, all living within a few streets of each other, who all wanted to be with me. “One brought me passion, one gave me friendship, the other stability. I felt like I got something special from each of them. “Alan was passionate and dangerous he was a brilliant lover. Tom was friendly and fun, he made me laugh and we got on so well. My husband was familiar and we had such a lot of history together. “I suppose it was flattering but more than anything, I didn’t want to hurt anyone. I was worried about hurting their feelings.“But I couldn’t even nip to the shop without bumping into one of them. I had to be very careful.”That Christmas, Natalie decided to end the relationship with Alan, but agreed that they would remain friends. She also agreed with her husband that they would separate formally and their relationship ended. She says: “I had decided to choose Tom. I hoped the others would understand.”But in March , Natalie and Tom had a huge row. He allegedly beat her up and was arrested.Natalie says: “It was a huge shock. Tom had never hurt me before. He was arrested and I went to hospital. For me, it was over. “Afterwards, I went to stay with a female friend.” The following morning, Natalie was arrested on suspicion of murdering Tom, . She says: “I was shell-shocked. I’d had no idea that Tom was even dead. To learn he had been murdered was heart-breaking.”Officers at first thought that Natalie had murdered Tom herself, in revenge for the attack on her. But she was released without charge after questioning.The following day, Alan Maidment was charged with Tom’s murder. Natalie says: “I was stunned. As far as I’d known there was no problem between Alan and Tom – their only connection was me. I couldn’t help feeling guilty – responsible for Tom’s death. “Alan had murdered Tom on my behalf – as revenge. It was sickening. “Tom deserved punishment for hitting me, but he did not deserve such a brutal death.” Alan Maidment appeared before Manchester crown Court in October . The court was told that Mr Jones was stabbed  times before his body was set on fire. The court heard Maidment acted in ‘revenge’ after hearing of what had apparently happened to Natalie, who it was said he still occasionally had sex with despite splitting up earlier in the year.The court was told that Mr Jones was arrested by police in connection with the alleged assault, but was released after Natalie stated she did not wish to press charges.Mr Jones had accused Natalie, who he had an on-off sexual relationship with while living in separate rooms of his flat, of sleeping with other men. Maidment initially confessed to police, saying he had committed the murder in revenge after hearing that Mr Jones had assaulted Natalie. He then claimed that former girlfriend Natalie, and a friend Stewart Hutchinson, in fact conspired to kill Mr Jones. But Maidment was found guilty of murdering Tom Jones after trial and earlier pleaded guilty to five counts of robbery and possession of a bladed weapon. These offences were committed whilst he was on the run after murdering Mr Jones.Maidment, , was jailed for le without parole after it was heard that he was already a convicted killer and had been released from prison the previous year for killing -year-old Paul Carlson – also in a perceived revenge attack."},{"url":null,"title":"kate middletons kind gesture help","story":"NewsKate Middletons kind gesture to help defuse tension between Meghan Markle and QueenMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton were both guests at the Commonwealth Day Service along with their husbands, but it wasnt the happy reunion we all hoped forShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video harry-share-awkward-greeting-take-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news kate-middletons-kind-gesture-help-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The couple were said to be upset and emotional after learning they couldnapost be part of the Queenaposs procession at the start of the service, instead being shown to their seats with the rest of the the guests.But in a bid to avoid any more drama, Prince William and Kate made a last minute change to try and ease the tension, reports the Daily Mail .The couple offered to join Meghan and Harry in skipping the procession, meaning they all waited for the service to start in their seats. The decision was only made on Sunday, after the order of services were printing - meaning they were incorrect. However their gesture reportedly didnapost work, and their meeting seemed slightly awkward as both couples took their seats.  The Sussexes arrived first and sat in the second row. The Cambridges were shortly behind them, but Meghan and Harry didnapost stand to greet them. Last year Meghan and Kate greeted each other with a kiss on each cheek, but they seemed more reserved yesterday. While it wouldnapost have been possible for them to kiss, the two couples exchanged only one or two words as they waited for the Queen and Prince Charles to arrive.  Meghan, who was already sitting down, can be seen saying hello and giving an awkward wave. Harry also says hello, but that was as far of their conversation went, with Harry turning to talk to his we. Sophie Wessex, who is sitting behind Kate, leaned forward to chat to the Duchess, while Harry and Meghan chatted to Prince Edward.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe parents of a one-year-old boy with a rare skin condition are so distraught by cruel trolls they avoid going out in public. Toddler Logan Webb has Alagille syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes liver damage and bile to be absorbed by the body and makes his skin turn yellow. His mum Gemma Channing, , and dad Lloyd Webb, , say his appearance makes it impossible to have a normal day out and that rude strangers have even called him a minion baby. Others have told the couple, from Exeter, that he looks jaundiced, or like Shrek or the Grinch. I always have people asking me whataposs wrong with him and that I should take him to hospital because he has jaundice, Gemma says. We get lots of people saying negative things such as asking why he looks like a minion and that he looks like Shrek or the Grinch. Every time we go out as a family thereaposs a constant reminder about Loganaposs condition. We canapost just leave the house and have a normal day out, we have to be stopped and reminded by someone about how poorly he is. On one occasion, a stranger even insisted that Gemma should immediately take her son to hospital.  We were in Sainsburyaposs with Logan doing a quick food shop and minding our own business, she explains. We got into the car and were about to drive off when a woman started banging on the window. Rather than asking us about Logan she had called a paramedic who happened to be in the car park to assess Logan. She then proceeded to tell us that we should take Logan to the hospital as he was clearly unwell. We tried to explain to her that he is being cared for and has a complex condition. She just stood there and said itwas her son sheaposd take him to hospital. The paramedic understood what we were saying but it was so embarrassing. We have horrible comments and questions whenever we leave the house. Sometimes it just breaks your heart.  Logan was diagnosed with Alagille syndrome soon after he was born in December . His parents have to give him a daily dosage of  dferent medications, as the condition means his liver doesnapostproperly and that his blood is only half oxygenated. Because his liver canapost process the bile in his body, it becomes absorbed into his skin, causing burning and itching as well as turning his skin yellow. His heart and liver defects also mean Logan canapost absorb food properly, so he is still only the size of a six-month-old baby even at the age of one.  The youngster is constantly in and out of hospital, which can be a traumatic ordeal, Gemma says. He canapost stop crying, heaposs very frightened of adults because he automatically assumes heaposll get a needle. Heaposs phobic of people and that puts a lot of strain on the family.

The -year-old was once so heavy he could not be weighed on conventional scales and had to use industrial ones. Doctors warned him thathe didnapost lose weight, his le would be at risk. Alex weighed more than  stone but now Alex has shed a massive  stone and is completely unrecognisable. Once too nervous to use a gym, Alex now gets up at am every day to work out and has completely overhauled his diet. Alex, from South Florida, said: There are a lot of things that I always knew I couldnapost do or I shouldnapost do, just knowing the weight that I was at but since Iaposve lost the weight, Iaposve accepted so many challenges. I did a Spartan Race, which is an obstacle race with a three-mile run in it. Iaposm  years old, I just learned how to ride a bike this year. Just because I was always bullied and picked on being the fat kid getting on the bike falling off. And doing CrossFit. The gym used to make me uncomfortable. Now Iaposm doing CrossFit every morning at am. Describing himself as “the big kid in class”, Alex added: Iaposve always had a problem with my weight. I was always picked last at gym and my weight just started to spiral and get out of hand right after high school when I just slowly became less and less active. Growing up in a Latin family, dinner times were a big feature with plenty of food and everyone expected to clear their plate. Alex, who admits the concept of a calorie used to be alien to him, said: Food was always a comfort as it is for a lot of people, I just abused it. And I was just eating all the wrong stuff in all the wrong amounts, just drinking  packs of Mountain Dew, eating tons of Oreos, pizza, Chinese buffet, ice cream, you name it, and I was just eating it and overindulging. I just had no knowledge of what calories or what eating all these foods was doing besides making my weight go up. By the time he was , a doctor had warned Alexhe didnapost shed the pounds, he would die.  Alex said: For my yearly check-in, the doctor actually told meI didnapost lose weight, I wasnapost going to live to see . But Alex didn’t take notice and put on so much weight he couldn’t weigh himself on domestic scales. Then one day, while making a delivery to a warehouse for his courier job, he decided to stand on the industrial pallet scale. He said: I never knew the exact weight that I was at because my doctor’s scale every year would only go up to  pounds, so it was always a guessing game. I was making a delivery to a warehouse in Deerfield, and it just so happened they had a pallet scale. Just out of curiosity, I stepped on and I was shocked. But also knew that it wasnapost a lie, that I was near lbs. When I stepped on the pallet scale and saw lbs, I completely shut down. I donapost even think I finished that day of work. I went home and completely threw out everything in my fridge that I knew was the problem the pizzas, the doughnuts, the soda, the Oreos, everything. And knowing that Iaposm an adult now, this is my le, it can either end really soon or I could start taking care of myself. It was all on me. In the first month he lost lbs just by ditching all liquid calories and only drinking water and a diet of chicken, broccoli and rice cakes.Alex also found a community of supporters on Instagram as well as being given practical advice and tips from family and friends.He said: I found a lot of pages that were just proof that you could do it naturally a lot of people were like me and I just followed pages that had cheat sheets for meal preps and dferent workout routines. I never had a trainer, I never had a nutritionist. The lowest weight Alex hit was lbs but as he has started to build up muscle he now fluctuates between -lbs. He said: I currently work out six to seven days a week. Every so often I will do a two-day. I do CrossFit every morning at am. With such a large amount of weight lost Alex has been left with a substantial amount of excess skin. He said: I lost lbs so I have a lot of loose skin in my gut area. However, I was able to shape and sculpt my arms and my back pretty tight. But in my gut and my thighs, I carry a lot of loose skin.

More than  people have now died of COVD- in the country, while British Airways and Ryanair have cancelled all international flights to and from the nation as it remains on entire lockdown. Our video journalist Hannah Dodd writes this chilling first-person account from Rome, where the tourism industry has taken the devastating impact. As she reports, the mighty Colosseum is closed, supermarkets are bare and loved ones canapost hold hands in what is one of the most romantic cities in the world... For live updates on coronavirus, visit our blog  We arrived in Rome on Saturday morning and it’s beyond belief how quickly the virus has taken the city. On our first day, the Trevi fountain, though quieter than usual, was still awash with tourists taking selfies, and sellers touting ponchos for the thunderstorms. By Sunday, the mighty Colosseum has fallen to COVD- .  Tourists were told they could not enter the interior to contain the spread of the virus, and the Roman forum was snapped up tight.It felt like swimming the channel only to be turned away at Normandy. By Monday, the line for the basilica was still as impressive as ever, though the bag scanners sat hauntingly empty and the Sistine Chapel was closed too. Monday evening, the full lockdown came into place and overnight bustling Rome fell practically silent. Tuesday morning saw empty shelves in pharmacies and supermarkets, no masks no sanitiser and yellow chalk lines around check outs so you didn’t stand too close to the cashiers.

The Australian, who is in his s, was the second person confirmed as having the disease in Tasmania, Australia on Sunday.

The following day he went into work at Hobart’s Grand Chancellor Hotel, it has been reported.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united louis appere scotland u 21","story":"Dundee United manager Robbie Neilson is thrilled that Louis Appere has been called-up to the Scotland U  squad – evenit means his forward could miss a title-clinching night in Arbroath.The -year-old has enjoyed a career-transforming season after being farmed out to Broughty Athletic juniors.On histo Tannadice, the Fer took his chance in pre-season and has gone on to make  appearances, scoring six goals.Also picked by Scot Gemmill for the U s is Cha’s Billy Gilmour, who had been tipped for a senior call-up ahead of the Euro  play-off semi-final against Israel.Scotland play Croatia at Tynecastle on Friday, March , the same night that United travel to Gayfield.They then face Greece away on Tuesday, March .Neilson may also have to do without Lawrence Shankland,he keeps his place in the full squad for the Euro  play-offs.“It’s phenomenal,” said the United boss.“Louis has been brilliant.

We’ve not been beaten in the last few games but it’s important to turn the draws into wins.“We created a number of chances against Alloa on Tuesday night. We just need to put those away going forward.“Alloa was a crazy game. When you look back at how many chances we created – good chances too. In a normal game they go in and it’s -.“It’s one of those things. We’ve taken a lot of positives from it and we’ll take them into the Ayr game.“I’m surprised, from the way I’ve seen us play, that we’re not further up the league.“The squad is a really good one. I thought: ‘It’s going to be really hard to get in the team in the first place,’ but, luckily enough, I was there within a game.“It’s important as a team that we stick together now and try to get as many points on the board as we can between now and the end of the season.”The consistency of James McPake’s recent team selections has translated into improved – and further improving – performances.The -- system employed by the Dee boss since the - draw away to Greenock Morton in early February seems to suit his players.For Elliott, that tactical comfort is a huge positive.“Everyone on the pitch knows their role,” he said.“Defensively, everybody knows what they need to be doing. We defend as a team. But we’ve also created a number of chances in each and every game I’ve played.“It’s important now that we keep going and keep building on the positives we’re taking from each game.“If you get a few wins together you never know how far you can push your way up.”A pair of wins in the next four days against Ayr would be a big ask but it would do the Dee cause the world of good.They would probably settle for four points.But you won’t catch anyone at Dens admitting it.“These games are massive,” said Elliott.“You look at other teams within the league, below you, and they still have an opportunity to finish in the play-offs, so it’s vital we keep picking up wins. But there’s confidence in the dressing-room. In all the games I’ve played, we’ve created loads of chances.“It’s important we keep doing that, keep doing the other things we’re good at, and get three points on the board whenever we can.”Come the end of the campaign, Dundee will have the option to extend Elliott’s stay at Dens.Whatever happens between now and the end of the season, that’s something the -year-old hopes they take up.“I just want to play games and do well for the club. If they like me, the ball’s in their court,” he said.“But as I said, I’ve enjoyed my time since I’ve been here. Everyone in and around the club is great and I would love to stay herethe club want me.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mcpake urges his team to get back on goal trail in crunch ayr clash","story":"James McPake has challenged his Dundee side to regain the scoring touch that has deserted them tonight at home to Ayr United.Since the start of March, the Dark Blues have been held to two goalless draws.There has been plenty of praise for the backline as they head into this home clash with the Honest Men having not conceded in  minutes.However, James is keen for his side to start grabbing the goals that will see them first overtake tonight’s opponents and then secure a promotion play-off place at the end of the campaign.He said: “We have managed to be consistently hard to beat but we have to find ways to be better at the other end of the pitch.“We are not quite hitting the heights we should be because we have good strikers in our team.“You have to be clinical in both boxes.“We had some chances against Ayr and against Alloa – no one could have complained had we come off with five goals.“I don’t think, on Saturday, you saw us at our best or Ayr at their best for that matter because the conditions were so bad.“They will be better and we will be better – that’s a given.”He added: “Getting a point away from home looks better for uswe can turn it around tonight.“Mark Kerr will say the same thing to his team – it’ll be a good four dayswe come away with four points.”Defender Jordan McGhee will be assessed before the match after he was taken off at half-time in Saturday’s clash.“Jordan McGhee has a dead leg so he will be assessed before the game and we will do all we can to get him fit.“If it feels OK then he will be fine to play.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e621255e805a3.39290847-scaled.jpg ","title":"reynolds fresh united need not worry about ict in title approach","story":"Captain Mark Reynolds believes a re-invigorated Dundee United side should have no concerns about Inverness as they aim to sew up the Championship title.Reynolds insists United are not worrying about an ICT side who have closed the gap at the top to  points and have two games in hand as they enter the final round of fixtures against Partick Thistle at Tannadice tomorrow.What was otherwise a good point as the Terrors played out a goalless draw at Ayr United on Tuesday night was soured slightly by the Caley Jags’ late - win over Morton.However, defender Reynolds feels, with no more midweek games between now and the end of the season, the Tangerines have an advantage over their opponents with more hectic schedules.Askedhe was disappointed to discover Inverness had won, the -year-old said: “Not really. It is what it is with them, they’re going to pick up results.“We’re not at the stage where we’re worrying about Inverness yet. We just need to focus on our own business.“We need to find those performances and results again.“Every game is going to be tough and Inverness are going to push it all the way.“They need to keep winning and hope we keep slipping up, but there’s nine games to go and we just need to look after our own business.“We’re still only a few wins away from it so we just keep taking it one game at a time as our focus turns to Partick tomorrow.“This league is tough. It’s dficult just now but the run we were on was unbelievable.“To go those  games unbeaten was incredible and that’s what got us that cushion.“Everybody is capable of beating each other and it’s never an easy night.“We went down to Ayr and they’re a good side, pushing for second place. They’re having a good season, have good players and are playing some nice football.“We knew it was going to be tough with Inverness winning but they’ll need to keep plugging away.” vw, px\"  Of their own dip in form since the turn of the year, Reynolds added: “It is frustrating but it’s a long season with injuries, change of personnel and teams are fighting for their lives.“Every team knows they need to get something and they want to slow us down. It’s a cup final when teams play us. Inverness felt that when they played us the other week and it was the same for Ayr.“It’ll be a tough run-in with people taking points off each other but we just need to keep plugging away and re-focus.“Luckily, our schedule goes from weekend to weekend from now on so we can hit every game fresh, with teams coming in with strained squads playing Saturday-Tuesday.”Reynolds admits United are eager to get back on home soil after some tough games on the road.“Tannadice has been a good place for us and we’re looking forward to getting back on a nice pitch.“The pitch down at Ayr held up well considering the amount of rain we’ve had but it’s nice to get back home.“We need to keep going and pushing to make sure we get three points. I think there’s pressure on every game, home and away, when you play for Dundee United.“We’re coming into every game as the league leaders and it’s been like that all season, but we’ve managed to handle it so far.“We go into every game confident we can win but we know that’s not going to happen.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

American.And although some may only know the titular song, Anything Goes, audiences are bound to fall in love with the equally tuneful I Get a Kick Out of You and Blow, Gabriel, Blow.If the classic showtunes werent enough to whet your theatre appetite, the amazing cast of this production will certainly capture your attention.Donning the flapper style, each cast member brings their own flair to their roles.Anything Goes star-crossed lovers, Hope Harcourt and Billy Crocker, played by Catriona Lamb and Jack McAuley show that even when apart, their characters determination to be together couldnt be stopped by those who would stand in their way. Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Alongside traffic that could be daunting, but thanks to the recent redevelopment of Sauchiehall Street I found almost all my route was traffic-free.My Volt and I could speed along to Charing Cross, use the pedestrian flyover, and then cut into Kelvingrove Park before emerging on Dumbarton Road. Even in rain I discovered the childlike joy of zooming through the park, the thrill of getting home more quicklythan ever before.I would happily ebike to work every day. Yet at pound,, the Volt is just a bit too pricey, even with an interest-free loan, for someone also trying to save to buy a house.

But its location- Shawlands, Glasgow- and itrsquos cooking- not derivative, surprising- now those nuggets of information I will retain for future reference. And visually, perhaps its blueness: indigo lighting that makes a feature of the bar, those azure blue tiles bathed in turquoise light, and the leggy bar chairs all stop the interior looking humdrum.The menu here wakes up my jaded palate. So often you read a menu once, find nothing much that you fancy, then scrutinise it again, trying to make the best of a bad job. Not here.

A smidgen of date jam, a quivering confit egg yolk also make the brassica more unctuous, while a snowfall of crispy fried onions adds contrasting texture. How good is this lamb rump  Maybe at this time of year it almost qualies as hogget, meat from older, more mature sheep. Certainly its intrinsic flavour is there in force, and itrsquos so pink and dreamily tender. A star in and of itself, the lamb comes with salt-baked beetroot that taste exceptionally of themselves, amber-crusted potatoes- in a sort of pommes Anna treatment, only made with duck fat rather than butter- with smoked whipped feta, and a judicious amount of black olive crumb layering on salty savouriness. A phenomenal plateful for pound, substantial enough to be a main course, and given the high cost of lamb, a definite bargain.lsquoGelrsquo  That words usually worries me, but this pearly cod in its IPA batter that comes with a lemon rendition converts me to the G word itrsquos strikingly right with the deep-fried fish.

Aside from the occasional draught which we could dodge by retreating to the back room, it was wonderfully toasty. This was in large part thanks to generous neighbours above and below whose central heating kept us permanently cocooned.In the country, as I quickly learned, in winter there are two main subjects of conversation: weather and warmth, but the greater of these is warmth. Hoolet, like many villages around here, has no gas supply, so central heating runs either by electricity or oil. The topic of electricity bills leads to much sucking in of breath, although there was one couple whose house somehow escaped the notice of the electricity board.Only when they sold up and the new owners found they werenrsquot being charged did it become clear why there had always been such a blazing array of Christmas lights in this particular garden. Rumour has it that, years earlier, a woman in this area greased a palm and had her meter erted to a lamp-post. It took a while before the extraordinarily high reading was finally noticed and an investigation began. Soon she was tracked down, along with her cannabis plants.The day is approaching when wersquoll all have to switch to renewables, but in the meantime our radiators drink oil. Every few days I check the gauge on the tank in the garden, half-closing my eyes as I pull out the pin and watch it drop one inch, then two. Since it can take over a week between ordering and getting a refill, you have to estimate how long it will last. If nothing , becoming aware of every drop of oil you use does mean that, while itrsquos the least environmentally friendly of fuels, it is never squandered. One friend is so thrty her grandchildren have renamed her house The Baltic.Long before, and after, they became fashionable, everyone around here wears a gilet. People only come to their doors in a tee-shirttheyrsquove been interrupted in the process of layering. I was watching a western the other night and saw a tobacco-spitting rancher on his porch, rle under his stained armpit. What caught my attention was his long-johns, the sort that reach from ankle to chin to wrist, with buttons down the front. Theyrsquore exactly what I need.Other than the relief of seeing the orange lights of the oil tanker arriving in the pitch black of a winterrsquos morning, there is nothing interesting about oil. Our other source of heat, however, is wood-burning stoves, and on this subject I could win Mastermind. We have two, which possibly saved my husbandrsquos le. When the Beast From the East descended on Hoolet, he was left with a gaping hole in the kitchen wall where the boiler had been taken out moments before the blizzard started. The heating engineers fled to get over Soutra Hill before they were snowed in, and his ordeal began: two log fires and two hot water bottles to get him through five days until the roads reopened. When he went into the kitchen to cook dinner, he had to wear hat and gloves as well as his puffa jacket.There is nothing more comforting in the cold than a roaring fire. In rural parts this is not a lestyle choice but an absolute necessity. Of an evening we get through about five logs, which is enough to keep a large room really cosy. When we started out, we were so ignorant wersquod never even heard the phrase ldquokiln dried and ndash Irsquom going beetroot just thinking about it ndash we bought logs in bags from BQ. Now, having found a good supplier, and with our own woodstore, the first thing we notice as we drive around the area is other peoplersquos woodpiles.Some are works of art, high as a gable end and stacked so expertly theyrsquore as solid as drystane dykes. A few keep them in a ramshackle heap, out in the open, where they soak up the rain. Quite apart from the level of emissions wet wood produces, which is why itrsquos high on the governmentrsquos hit-list, it is far less efficient, generating less warmth and more smoke. Butyoursquore patient, green wood dries out ndash Irsquove heard you should wait two years for anything yoursquove cut down yourself. My father would have scoffed at that, as hersquod bring the car to a sudden halt, nip out and drag a huge storm-tossed branch into the boot ndash ldquotidying up the countryside as he put it. Back home, he stoked the flames so high we had to push the furniture back against the walls and open the living room door.The other day we had a delivery of ash, dumped in front of the house in a crate big enough to hold a wild boar. As the lumberjack was in bed barking like a sea-lion, it fell to me to deal with it. I was well on my way when Lazarus rose from the duvet to check on the proceedings and pointed out that I was laying them sideways rather than end-on. As the sun disappeared and clouds gathered I started again. By this time a neighbour had spotted me, and helped me finish the job.The sense of satisfaction in having it all safely stored, shortly before snowfall, was incalculable. Thatrsquos the thing about wood. The connection between you and the trees yoursquore burning creates a new respect and understanding. For a start, freshly chopped logs give off a delicious scent. And each one is dferent ndash whorled, fissured, misshapen, or neatly wedged like a giant slice of cake. If you chose to count the rings yoursquod see how many years had gone into making a blaze that lasts only a few hours."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Alex Salmond     the trial that could split the SNP from top to bottom","story":"Tomorrow, in Edinburghrsquos High Court, Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader and First Minister of Scotland, will go on trial accused of  criminal charges including attempted rape, sexual assault and harassment.Journalists ndash and the political world ndash have been talking of little  for months.It would, of course, be illegal to report any rumours or the identity of the claimants. The accusers in sexual assault and rape trials have anonymity.Journalists or editors who disclose any information that could prejudice a criminal trial, or make comments likely to influence jurors, could be guilty of contempt of court, and end up in jail.Already, one pro-SNP commentator, the former British diplomat Craig Murray, has been warned by the Crown Office that a satirical post he published in January could be ldquogravely in contempt.So, no satire or speculation from me. I make no comment about Mr Salmondrsquos guilt or innocence. Irsquoll just say that these are serious charges, potentially carrying long prison sentences.And that the Crown Office has released a lot of detail already.The indictment alleges that Mr Salmond attempted to rape a woman in his official residence in Bute House in June . He is said to have pinned her against a wall, to have removed her clothes and his own, before pushing her on to a bed and lying naked on top of her.In December , he is alleged to have caused a woman to lie on his bed, struggled with her and pulled up her dress.Other charges include an allegation he groped a woman in the Ego nightclub in Edinburgh in or around , and to have removed a womanrsquos shoe in  and tried to kiss her foot.Mr Salmond insists that he is innocent of all criminal charges.Like any defendant, the former First Minister has the presumption of innocence on his side. His guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.This trial ndash of one of the leading Scottish politicians of the age ndash will have huge political reverberations. It comes at a crucial moment for the SNP and the nationalist movement.Salmondrsquos prosecution intersects with growing isions over the future direction of the independence campaign. It could also affect Nicolarsquos Surgeonrsquos future as leader.There is a parliamentary inquiry into what the First Minister knew about the allegations about her mentor, and when she knew them. She has admitted that she held a number of private meetings with Salmond about the allegations without informing her civil servants.More seriously, this trial breaks just as increasing numbers of SNP activists are despairing of the prospects for a second independence referendum. Sturgeon keeps promising to deliver indyref, but it never arrives.Many frustrated nationalists believe thatAlex Salmond had still been leading the party, there would have been a referendum of some sort by now. They believe Sturgeon is too small lsquocrsquo conservative. Too insistent on a strictly legal route to independence.Salmond ndash and I state this not as a character reference ndash was one of the most successful populist politicians Britain has ever produced. An insurgent with a unique gt for communicating with Scottish voters of all backgrounds, he always led from the front.In , after he became leader of the SNP, he pulled the party to the left and made ldquoIndependence in Europe the partyrsquos mission statement. Then, in the mid-s, he defeated the fundamentalists in the party and persuaded the SNP to support devolution.Labour Politicians like the Cabinet minister, George Robertson, said that the Scottish Parliament, inaugurated in , would ldquokill nationalism stone dead. It did precisely the reverse.In , Alex Salmond declared himself First Minister of the first SNP Government in history. Then,in , he led the SNP to a landslide election victory and demanded a referendum on independence.At the time, independence was much less popular than the SNP. This was why the then-prime minister, David Cameron, agreed to a referendum in the first place thinking he couldnrsquot lose. In the event, the Yes campaign came within % of winning the  referendum, plunging the UK state into panic.With that track record, it is hardly surprising that many nationalists see Salmond as a politicianwho can literally do no wrong and refuse to believe the charges against him.Two years ago, before the sexual misconduct allegations first arose, Salmond had been making clear he intended toto active politics, following his retirement in . He even suggested he would be one of the leaders of the next independence referendum campaign. Not everyone in the party thought this would be a good thing.At no time did he challenge Nicola Sturgeonrsquos leadership ndash she was, after all, his protege and worked intimately with him for over a decade in the Scottish Government. But Salmond was known to be looking for a safe route back into Parliament.Then in August of that year a story was leaked to the Daily Record that two civil servants had made complaints of sexual misconduct by Alex Salmond in . Salmond rejected the allegations and in turn accused the head of the Scottish Civil Service, Lesley Evans, of misconduct.He took the Scottish Government to the Court of Session and won in January . The Scottish Government admitted fault and ended up paying Alex Salmond pound, of taxpayersrsquo money. It was massive humiliation.Most people, Salmond included, thought that would be an end of the matter. But only weeks later he was arrested by police on multiple charges of attempted rape and sexual assault.His followers simply refuse to believe that this icon of independence is anything but innocent. SNP members have poured tens of thousands into his defence fund.This has allowed him to put together a high-powered defence team, led by Gordon Jackson QC, Dean of the Faculty of Advocates. He is supported by Shelagh McCall QC, the chair of the human rights organisation Justice Scotland.Some years ago, Jackson successfully defended a Collie dog, who was about to be put down after allegedly biting a policeman. He won after Brigitte Bardot flew in to support the defence.Such glamorous witnesses are not expected in the Salmond case. But all eyes will be on the High Court of Justiciary tomorrow to seeJackson can deliver an even greater legal victory."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-people-mild-infections-told-self-isolate","story":"The change in advice, which might take place as soon as next week, came as NHS England announced a fth person had died from the illness.Camleys Cartoon: Coronavirus sends markets into freefallAs of am on Monday, there were  confirmed cases across the UK, a rise of  on the previous day.

Therersquos tears and hugging and kissing and promises of everlasting love. But for some itrsquos clear therersquos no physical attraction at all.All six couples head off to Mexico for a holiday ndash and to seeprotestations of love can become physical love. The bottom line is: will they have sex The answer is that most do, but some donrsquot. And itrsquos painful to see how this lack of intimacy eats away at strong friendships which had been built on personality not looks.Once the holiday is over, itrsquos time to try living together. This is were the cracks really begin to show ndash where the glamour and thrill of falling in love are replaced by the daily demands of sharing your every waking hour with someone whorsquos still essentially a stranger.Then itrsquos time to meet the parents, to work out where to live. Who will make compromises over their career  Who wants a child  Who doesnrsquot As the weeks tick away, therersquos only one challenge left ndash to make it to the altar.I finished the series last night. Do they all marry  Well, I donrsquot want to give any spoilers away but I suppose in some cases love can be blind ndash in other cases love has very clear - vision.The contestants are all millennials. No-one is over . Netflix, of course, is able to navigate the millennial hive mind like no other part of our media or culture ndash its producers, directors and writers seem to intuitively know how millennials tick, what appeals to them, and what they need.And so what makes Love is Blind so fascinating is how the series focuses on romantic isolation. It seems to be saying that at its heart the millennial generation is lonely. And that is genuinely saddening.The participants in the show were all desperate for love. Love has been hard to find for them.The show felt like a subconscious rejection of the dating app, of the inhumanity of swiping left and right for love and romance and sex. The contestants have spent their lives behind screens.Dating apps are about one thing: the purely physical ndash is a potential partner good enough looking. The true personality of others goes undiscovered. Love is Blind reverses that, and itrsquos neatly subversive.Once upon a time all of us either met our partners at school, in our neighbourhoods, at college or university, at work, or in pubs and clubs. Today, community is fading away like leaves in winter.Love is Blind seemed to pity a generation dealing with the challenges of falling in love at a time when many are unsure what the rules are anymore, or even where to find love or how to find love, of a world where office romances might be frowned upon by HR or college flirting misconstrued.Itrsquos a rare emotion to feel these days, but Love is Blind reaffirms common humanity. The participants dealt with all the problems that have come with falling in love down the ages ndash money, family, bigotry.And all the joys: finding a partner in crime, devotion to another person, unconditional support.And when it came to the battle of the sexes both were as bad, and as good, as each other. Men failed, men were kind women failed, women were kind.This reality series shows that whatrsquos changed in this constantly changing age isnrsquot love itself. Love has mercully remained the same, itrsquos the one essential part of what we are which makes us human. Whatrsquos changed is the way we look for love, find love, and fall in love.This is love in the time of the coronavirus. Wersquore inherently social creatures but the digital world is shutting us away from one another. Self-isolating. Thatrsquos not just a threat to love, but to what it means to be human.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year."},{"url":null,"title":"reckless-brexit-plans-the-elephant-room-says-snp","story":"Kirsty Blackman MP has warned that the Conservativesrsquo Brexit plans will leave families poorer and worse off, and push people towards hardship.She said the Tories were ldquowriting a blank cheque for their own self-interest by ignoring the views of those who did not vote for Brexit.:UK Governmentrsquos Brexit position dangerous, says Mike RussellSpeaking to The Herald, Blackman said: ldquoAs the UK government prepares to set out its Budget it cannot ignore the elephant in the room.

Therefore, the decision to go with one team was made.“As I’m sure we can all understand, Shetland, who have supported us throughout, were unhappy with this decision and asked Orkney to reconsider and look at other ways to try to field a second team.“For Orkney, the cost of travel and the amount the association would have to subsidise players’ travel made sending two teams unfeasible.“Shetland voiced their concern over the cost of organising the event for only one team, and, after further discussions, the decision was finally taken that this year’s senior inter-county would not take place.“This decision has not been taken lightly, and the committee and players involved are very disappointed.“We hope the fixtures willnext year.”Shetland are in the midst of an unrelenting winning run at senior inter-county level Orkney having last won the ‘A’ fixture in .Leask said: “We tried to re-arrange it. Both counties have tried to do as much as we can.”The  inter-county will be the th anniversary of the fixtures, and both counties will be eager to ensure the occasion is celebrated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The slow progress on establishing basic connectivity for businesses and iniduals in the Northern Isles has been deeply frustrating. Concrete action to remedy this problem can only be a good thing.“This, however, is only the first step. I have been led to understand that the first upgrades to the network are to begin in the autumn, and we will be looking for swt action.”He continued: “With a plan in place and an agreement signed there can be no more excuses. By  islanders will rightly expect an end to coverage not-spots and the arrival of a mobile network fit for purpose.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to this report, in fact, Huawei is one of the companies that has benefitted.”Responding during the debate, Iain Duncan Smith MP said: “I think that’s shocking. I thinkthat is true it is an absolutely indictment and I do think the British Government has got to be speaking up more. It is shocking and it is time that we call it for what it is.”Summing up at the end of the debate, the minister for digital infrastructure, Matt Warman MP, said: #The UK has been vocal in drawing attention to the systematic violation of human rights of Uighur Muslims. We set out our expectations in the UK National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights.”Speaking after the debate, Mr Carmichael added: “The reports surrounding Huawei and the use of forced labour are concerning. Local people want better connectivity in the Northern Isles and where, but they don#t want it built on the back of slave labour.

Youth team Strom-West also offers a pathway for young girls to develop to senior football.Kirsty Brown, who plays for Kirkwall City, explained: “Women’s football in Orkney, over the last couple of years, has taken a massive step.“We’ve seen the development of Kirkwall City, in addition to Orkney Women’s Football Club, and the logical step now is try and come together, get as strong as we possibly can, and to get inter-county and Island Games going.“ is a massive step ahead of us. It’s not that long away, so we definitely need to work together and see what we can do.“There’s fantastic players in both sides. It’s great that we’ve got two clubs. It’s completely needed for the number of players in Orkney. Both teams are in the Highlands and Islands League this year, playing  matches each.“That’s a massive opportunity for the girls and women in Orkney to play competitively, but the association will bring these two teams together and form an even stronger squad who can play on an inter-county level.“The meeting itself is an initial AGM. We would really like to be in a position where we could form a committee, officially start the association, and move forward in the best way possible for the future of football.”Developing Orkney as a county squad and an Island Games regular will take time, effort and commitment.Like many sports, women’s football is now putting the building blocks in place for a successful Games in , but early discussions are taking place in regards to sending a side to the  Games in Guernsey.Nicola Croy, who plays her football for Orkney Women’s, said: “The  Games will be an eye-opener. There’s a lot of great teams out there, so it will show Orkney how much we need to come together as an Island Games team and prepare ourselves for our home  Games.“Once this committee is set up, we can start with developing the county and Island Games team.”Among the positions to fill will be coach of the new county side, tasked with guiding the development of the team and leading the team to success.And in a bid to expand the playing pool even further, women who may not be playing league football currently are still encouraged to attend the meeting in April.Brown added: “There is a magnitude of abilities out there in Orkney and they’re maybe not playing.“Anybody that wants to get involved in any way, come along on April .

It suggests that agreement is possible on how the newer vessels that our internal ferry services so desperately need might be funded.“Fuel and maintenance costs continue to rise steeply, while the disruption caused by the removal of MV Eynhallow from service illustrates perfectly the urgency of putting in place vessels that are fit for purpose.“The Transport Minister has acknowledged again that Orkney’s internal ferry services fall well below the minimum standards set out in the government’s own National Ferries Plan. He also insists that discussions with the Council to find a long term solution to the delivery of these leline services are ‘ongoing’.“Meantime, however, the communities in Orkney most directly affected are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of visible progress. No doubt they will be hoping that the resolution regarding the Golden Mariana’s replacement now paves the way for agreement between the council and ministers on a wider programme of vessel replacement.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But there’s also something for adults, with the Freaky Sequin Cabaret and the madness of the Old Time Sailors raucous flashmob concerts.Keeping to the sea theme, there will be two talks telling tales of the high seas — one on a canoeing trip around the UK and the other a near-death experience on the Round the World yacht race.“This year we’re trying to take events out across the islands and to introduce audiences to experiences in new venues,” said Alasdair.“So we’ll see a horn quartet in the kitchen of Noltland Castle on Westray and talks about le on the high seas in Highland Park Distillery.”The festival ends with a silent film, accompanied by a live performance of newly created music.Orkney’s midsummer St Magnus International Festival marks the start of the summer’s festivals in Scotland and each year brings large numbers to the islands, boosting the economy and revealing Orkney to the wider world.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This data will then be used in further assessing the viability of the sites.The masts are due to be installed at Quanterness and Hoy by the end of March — with a dferent kind of measurement system being used at the site in Faray.Planning permission for the masts was approved in December last year.Meteorological masts are an assembly of bolted, galvanised steel tube sections, consisting of a series of anemometers, wind vanes and a data logger, solar , temperature sensor and antenna. The equipment gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.The masts will be up to  metres in height and will be in place for up to two years.If the Community Wind Farm Project#s proposals and sites are found through the planning process to be appropriate and the project goes forward, OIC believes it could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney. The council has stated that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling OIC to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon and providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council also hopes that developments will also allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a needs case for a new interconnector for Orkney, with the aim of substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Due to practical limitations, the Faray site has already had a Lidar system installed to measure wind speed and direction.  Lidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging and is very similar to radar.The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six turbines and the site on Faray has enough space for up to seven turbines. The current proposal at the site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines at a blade tip height of up to .m.Pre-application consultation for the proposed site at Quanterness took place in November last year and a planning application was lodged with the planning authority in January. OIC has since written to the Scottish Government to ask that they call in the application, on grounds of national signicance.Further public consultation events are planned for Hoy in March, with Faray events in Eday and Westray likely to take place in May.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

Sandi B - Make the world go around. I love happy dance tunes. I’ve great memories at Kelly’s  Circus when this tuuuuuuunnnnnee came on. . The Cult - She sells Sanctuary. No other reason than this should only be listened too at full volume. Lethal car tune. Many odd looks at traffic lights when I have this on! . Pink Floyd - Shine on you crazy diamonds. I had the pleasure of seeing Pink Floyd in London mid ’s with one of my oldest friends.I love their music but this song always reminds me of that concert and the mental weekend. . The Fureys - I will love you. This is a breathtaking love song.I imagine this is how my parents were. . Sylvester - Do ya Wanna Funk  This is my No dance tune.It reminds me of our disco dance team at Ballykeel youth club.Later during our Rave years BinMan used to play this as a mix.It was lethal.

This is thee most beautul Hymn.I love the lead up to Christmas. It’s a constant in my house. On repeat! I gave off to my girls about watching yet more American rubbish and then became utterly addicted to Glee myself. Their covers are often better than the originals. . Donna Summer - McArthur ParkIn our house I would have frequent discos with my girls.We didn’t have much and often le was hard but we always danced and put on shows. It’s was disco, disco, disco!We had to see who could hold the Note the longest. A few years back Santa brought me a new record player and the girls bought me this album.It’s still a favourite with the  of us. They still love the ‘old’ tunes. . James Arthur - Falling like the stars. I love James Arthur.This song is another level. It reminds me of my partner. . Eurthymics - Here comes the rain again.

He said that the book would pull no punches and he has been true to his word.Praise for The Penny Bridge Boy has come from one of the UKs leading martial artists who says he was hooked very early.Peter Consterdine, a th Dan Karate master and chief instructor with the British Combat Association, reviewed the book in the following terms:-I was captivated enough to read the book in one sittings. Dan Redmond was brought up in a supportive family but dogged through his youth by violence - and this had him walking a fine line with authority.JAPANAs many people will attest who have been through similar and often damaging experiences, it was the martial arts that pretty much saved Dan, gave him direction and steadied the ship. “Eventually his pursuit of knowledge and the best training in karate took him to such places as mainland Japan, Okinawa and the USA on a number of occasions.Over the years, Dan has built up a very solid reputation in the karate world and his journey through le with the martial arts as his compass is engagingly told in this well written biography. This is a book for everyone, not just martial artists, as the le lessons are of value to us all.

It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new inquest sought","story":"RELATIVES For Justice are to ask the Attorney General for a fresh inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of republicanprisoner Francis Dodds.From St Katherine’s Road in St James’, Francis Doddswas sentenced to four years imprisonment in March  for possession of explosive material. The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages. The prison governor refused to allow this and unfortunately Francis was ed to Long Kesh and no arteriogram took place before he died.”Former prisoners can contact RFJ on   or email paul.butler@relativesforjustice"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there.

A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March .

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBelfast City Hall.By Michael KenwoodMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailBelfast City Council will send a second round of letters to the UK and Irish Governments asking to clary the criteria for an Irish unity referendum.It comes after Sinn Fein claimed both failed to answer the question directly.In December the council sent a letter calling for the establishment of a New Ireland Forum alongside a series of Citizens# Assemblies ahead of a border poll. The letter also called for specic details from both governments as to what conditions would facilitate a referendum.Matthew Ellesmere, from the Northern Ireland Office in London, replied: It remains the Secretary of State#s view that a majority of the people of Northern Ireland continue to support Northern Ireland#s place in the United Kingdom and that this is unlikely to change for at least the foreseeable future. The circumstances set out in the Belfast Agreement that require the Secretary of State to hold a referendum on Irish unication are therefore not satisfied.Responses from both governments failed to mention specic criteria for a border poll.At the recent full council meeting, Sinn Fein#s Ciaran Beattie referred to the concluding sentence in the letter sent by the council last December: The council agrees to write directly to the Taoiseach and to the British Secretary of State requesting that they clearly specy what would satisfy the requirement, as provided for under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, to facilitate an Irish unity referendum.Mr Beattie said neither government had answered the question in their responses, and the council should send another letter asking for clarity.DUP councillor David Brooks said the British and Irish Governments# responses should be noted, with no further action.He said: The idea that either government would form constitutional views or politics based on the view of this council is fancul.One way we can cut down on motions here is by concentrating on those within the competency of this council -we#ve said that once we#ve said it a thousand times.Mr Brooks said there was no value in sending letters back and forward to the governments.Alliance councillor Michael Long said: I#d like to outline my environmental credentials and ask why we would waste a lot more paper on something where we wouldn#t get a clear answer. I just don#t see the point in sending another letter. Mr Beattie in reply suggested the council could send an email.The DUP amendment failed, with  members for and  against. The Sinn Fein proposal passed, and another letter will now be drafted and sent to London and Dublin.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDerry Girls shirt insults Christianity, says Ian Paisley#s widowTributes to young Antrim farmer Ward Patterson after sudden deathCoronavirus: Belfast Halax call centre closed after staff member tests positive Coronavirus: Belfast restaurant closes as a #precautionary measure# Cash in transit employee threatened with handgun during Belfast city centre armed robbery,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Auditors from energy watchdog Ofgem have deemed this irregular spending, which is expected to hit a total of £m by the year  .In , there was a massive spike in applications to the scheme which the RHI inquiry was told was partly due to information being shared with the renewable energy industry.The then Department for Enterprise discussed possible tarf cuts to the scheme with firms in the biomass sector in the summer of that year.One civil servant told the inquiry  he thought there should have been less promotion of the scheme as officials already knew the cost for that year was twice the available budget. Ex-DUP MLA Jonathan Bell, then the minister responsible for RHI, told the inquiry that officials had not informed him of the spike in applications.It was told that one adviser said we could fill our boots as the scheme was being paid for from the Westminster budget, rather than Stormont#s.The forecast cost of the RHI scheme in   is £-m, thanks to cost controls which were put in place in . Before these changes were introduced the total cost was expected to be around £.bn, more than twice the scheme#s estimated cost of £m when it was set up in .Those who may face criticism in Sir Patrick#s report this week have already been given the opportunity to respond to his findings.The Monday following his publication, Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy will face questions from MLAs in the Assembly.In total, the Executive#s legal bill for the inquiry is estimated at £.m, with the overall cost of the nearly year-long investigation put at £.m.The RHI scheme was launched by then economy minister Arlene Foster in  and was meant to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources.But the low cost of the wood pellet fuel compared to the generous subsidies created a burn to earn scenario where boilers could be operated purely to make a profit from the scheme.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNewsDissident given le for killing prison officer Ismay undertook weapons trainingDissident killer Christie Robinson was hell-bent on killing a prison officer and underwent weapons training to prepare himself for murder.Irish League LivesIrish League Lives: Legendary keeper George Dunlop on calling time on his own glittering Blues careerBig Ivan Little takes a fair share of stick about his television gaffe many years ago when his vocabulary expertise failed him in his pronunciation of the word phenomenon.NewsDisgraced youth group leader jailed over park sex actThis is the disgraced former youth group leader who has been jailed after being caught on video committing a lewd sex act in front of three teenage girls. was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"SportOpinionCarl Frampton:My integrated education came through boxing and it allowed me to develop lelong friendships with CatholicsIn some ways, Northern Ireland has moved forward and in others it has stood still and that#s why I#m so passionate about the development of integrated education across the land. sundayleThug who attacked teen with samurai sword jailed for nine yearsA man who attacked a teenager with a samurai sword has been jailed for nine years.sundayleCourt translator appears in dock himself to admit growing cannabis plantsA Northern Ireland court service interpreter has appeared in the dock himself to admit growing cannabis. from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"sundayleSouth American student charged with causing death of Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless drivingA South American student has been charged with causing the death of a Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless driving.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDerry Girls shirt insults Christianity, says Ian Paisley#s widowTributes to young Antrim farmer Ward Patterson after sudden deathCoronavirus: Belfast Halax call centre closed after staff member tests positive Coronavirus: Belfast restaurant closes as a #precautionary measure# Cash in transit employee threatened with handgun during Belfast city centre armed robbery,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Councillor for the area, Brenda Chivers, said that although the provision of a waste water plant was still an issue for the school development, she didn’t see it as ‘problematic’. She said: “I sincerely hope that work on the new school will commence as soon as possible. “I would praise all the good work of pupils, staff, parents and the Board of Governors for all their diligent work to date.”Local GAA side Limavady Wolfhounds have also been given the go-ahead to develop their existing provision on the Scroggy Road.The work will include a new grass pitch, G training area, ball catchers and a walking path around the complex. Committee member Declan Quigley and his company AQB Architectural Workshop were a driving force in the development.He said: “This involves the redevelopment of an empty field known to the club as the ‘hill field’. It lies to the rear of our existing main pitch.“We were facing the possibility of losing our existing training grounds at some point when the lease runs out and the parish kindly agreed to sell us the area required to build a second pitch.“Once that was put in place, a planning application was lodged for a second full-size grass pitch with floodlighting, fences, dugouts and ball catches.“We had enough ground to provide an underage G training pitch. It’s a half-size pitch which is also floodlit.“Looking towards giving back to the community and giving parents something to do while their kids are down at training, we developed the idea of a km walking loop.“It meanders around the existing pitch and will go around the proposed new phase development. It will have lighting on it so anyone can come and do walk when it suits them.“That was approved through council last week and the club would like to thank Causeway Coast and Glens council for the approval. “It leaves us in a position where we can develop that bit of ground and protect the club’s future, while maintaining a valuable youth link, which is very important in an urban setting.“We have five years to develop it from a planning point of view, but would like to get that process started immediately, or as soon as financially possible.”Cllr Chivers said the development would further improve the developments the club has made to date.She said: “This will signicantly enhance the excellent facilities that this far-seeing and dynamic club have provided to date.“I congratulate all the management, members, players and supporters on all their efforts.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Following the decision, the applicant Clanmil Housing Association, said it was ‘very disappointed’ with the decision and would consider the full range of options moving forward. The application was for the erection of a four-storey building comprising of  two-bedroom apartments with rooftop amenity space, new access arrangements from Victoria Road, servicing and drop off provision, bin stores, cycle parking, landscaping and associated site works. The Council’s planning department recommended that committee members approve the application with an officer saying it was entirely compliant. googletag.cmd.push It was described as possibly the most dficult regeneration site in the city, which was originally given planning approval in . It sits m below the level of the Victoria Road and is boxed in by the River Foyle and perimeter walls with limited accessibility. The application received a total of  representations,  objections and one letter of support. Of the total,  related to the amended design which incorporates a glass tower separating the two blocks. In the report it is noted that the primary objections to this development are no parking provision for residents and the adverse impact of congestion on Victoria Road caused by vehicles turning in and out of the site. googletag.cmd.push Developers proposed that there would be no parking on site, aside from operational parking, such as bin lorries and emergency services. CCTV monitoring and barrier operation would be automated for -hour operation. Planning officers said it will reinvigorate riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. The natural brick was chosen to better complement the stone finish of the historic Ice House - which sits adjacent - and provide a contemporary building as recognition of the industrial heritage of the wider area. Around two stories of the building would be visible from the Victoria Road and you would see the building from lands opposite on the Foyle Road. ‘Eyesore’ Speaking at the meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group raised a number of objections. He described the design as a horric brutalist East German style eyesore . He said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. Mr Hegarty believed Clanmil Developments would later apply for parking spaces. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in hazardous parking on Victoria Road. He envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. The local resident questioned how it would work allowing only one vehicle on to the site at a timeother vehicles were waiting. Mistakes have been made in the past with the BT building and others near Derry’s riverfront and he hoped the planning committee wouldn’t be remembered for this carbuncle. In response, an agent representing Clanmil said the development would go some way to reducing the housing demand in Derry with around , people on the waiting list. He refuted the suggestion of a future application for car parking saying that was absolutely not the case as there will be a zero parking solution on site and people would manage deliveries. Housing applicants would be made aware that there is no car ownership in this scheme. It is a highly accessible location with bus stops and train travel nearby, he added. The agent also contended that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. Congestion  Above: Artists impression of the building from Foyle Road. Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney who is a lorry driver said it would only take one heavy goods vehicleto block the Victoria Road and there would be massive tailbacks. “At the best of times it’s absolutely horrendous, it would only take one timed delivery to go wrong and traffic would be down past the Everglades Hotel.” He was assured there would be no disruption to traffic on the Victoria Road and told there’s enough room for one vehiclethe barrier was down. SDLP Councillor Angela Dobbins said she normally had brilliant things to say about Clanmil but on this occasion believed that the no parking clause discriminates against disabled applicants. “Disability Action will have a lot of issues with this development.” She added: “You’re saying, people can have an apartment with lovely views overlooking the Foyle as long as they’re not disabled or have complex needs.” In terms of parking on Duke Street and Spencer Road, she said it has a one hour parking restriction and askedresidents would be expected to park after pm. The Ballyarnett Cllr suggested Clanmil needed to be educated. While acknowledging a “housing deficit”, she said, people need quality housing, a quality le, quality access and disabled people should have the same rights as everyone . A Clanmil representative said a range of accommodation is needed and people with complex needs are allocated houses by the Housing Executive. Refused Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein Councillor Patricia Logue, said no distinction should be made between applicants and homes are allocated on a points-based system. “Those with the highest points are given first offer and refusal.” Disabled tenants may have carers who have to visit them three times a day. She warned that Clanmil could be taken to the Equality Commission over the scheme as some people need a car and can’t be treated dferently to those who don’t. Chair of the committee, Christopher Jackson, echoed her views saying those waiting years on homes shouldn’t have to choose between a home or their car. People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced the need for housing but believes it has to be done right. He said: “Representatives are trying to create a more accessible city and district for those with disabilities.” He wasn’t convinced about the aesthetics of the building and insisted that the beautul riverfront must be regenerated appropriately. “It looks to me like a car parking facility, I don’t mean to insult the designer.” Picking up on Cllr Logue’s point about carers, DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said people want letime homes but don’t know when their circumstances might change. Cllr Dobbins proposed that members do not accept the planning officers’ recommendation and refuse the application on grounds that it is contrary to access and movement and because of the design. “It does not allow people with disabilities to be included in a social housing scheme,” she concluded. Seven councillors voted in favour of her proposal, none against and there were four abstentions. The application was therefore refused. Afterwards a Clanmil spokesperson said: “Whilst we acknowledge the thinking of committee members, this city centre scheme could help address urgent housing need in the Waterside area. “This decision is therefore particularly bad news for families who desperately need a home. “We are considering the full range of options available to us and will decide on a way forward shortly.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We will be working closely with all parties to ensure this becomes a reality.“While the UK left the EU at the end of January, the UK Government’s announcement last week that it is prepared to walk away from trade talks by June is hugely concerning for businesses across the North West, especially those who trade and travel across the border.“Over the next nine months, Chamber will be working hard to ensure businesses in the North West have access to unfettered trade across Great Britain, the EU, and beyond.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Strand Road burrito bar has not opened in recent days. Boojum has made no official comment on the situation. However, Derry Now visited the outlet this afternoon and a team of workers were removing the fixtures and fittings from the building. One of the workers confirmed that the outlet has closed. The closure of the Boojum outlet, which only opened at the start of last year, will be another blow to the economy of the Strand Road area. Last year, the Primrose cafe, which was only a few doors up from Boojum, also closed. Prior to the Boojum outlet, the corner building at the junction of the Strand Road and Clarendon Street was home to the Sandwich Company. googletag.cmd.push  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At , the long-time proprietor of a Pennyburn sports shop is a le-affirming example to others of how to live a meaningful le after sporting retirement, thanks to the enduring power of friendship.  He pulls up the metal shutters of the shop and fights with the key as it struggles to unlock the door.It’s a short trip from home to his premises in Pennyburn but it’s a well-trodden path for a man now in his s.With a local paper snuggly secured under his armpit he’s made this journey in rain, hail and shine. Through good times and bad.It’s the same old routine every morning, one well-rehearsed over  years of business. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Jobby’s Sports Centre opened in the late s after he bought it from his friend Raymond Daly. I was entering a business I knew something about,’ Jobby says now. Picture: Tom Heaney  But this is no ordinary shop, and this is no ordinary shopkeeper.John Hume can probably hold claim to be Derry’s most famous living citizen. But without any shadow of a doubt, the Maiden City’s most famous sporting son is John ‘Jobby’ Crossan.Crossan needs no introduction in these parts, but for the benefit of the uninitiated ‘Jobby’ Crossan was born in  at Hamilton Street in Derry.A precocious talent Crossan played as an inside forwardfor his hometown team, Derry City. His performances quickly garnered the attention of the top scouts from England, where thespoke of the -year-old wonder boy of Irish soccer … Irelands Jimmy Greaves. In August  he joined Sparta Rotterdam, before making his debut for Ireland against England at Wembley. But more of that game later.Crossan joined Standard Liegravege in , playing for the Belgian side in a European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid.Ian Rush may have famously described playing in Italy like being in a foreign country, but the Derry man negotiated this precarious new le abroad with all the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Fully focused: team captain Crossan leads out Manchester City, a club he joined after a successful spell at Sunderland. He moved on to Middlebrough in .  “It was great,” he enthused. “I thoroughly enjoyed it. I might have been lucky as a player but obviously I could play a wee bit. We learned a couple of languages and things. We were fortunate because we were winning matches, playing for trophies. Played against the top teams. We played Real Madrid in the semi-final of the  European Cup. We beat Rangers in the quarter-finals and I happened to get two goals.”In September  he moved to Sunderland, the start of a successful eight-year spell in England that also took him to Manchester Cityand Middlesbrough.In a European Championship qualier against Poland he scored one of the finest goals that Windsor Park has ever witnessed, a spectacular and acrobatic volley from  yards. And in a World Cup preliminary game Crossan scored three against Albania.He retired from the professional game in .But this isn’t a feature about a footballer, a special talent, a shopkeeper. That tale has been told before.This is a story about something more important than that.This is a story of friendship.Upon retirement Crossan faced the same dilemma as most professional sportsmen – how to fill the void.“Your whole world changes and you have to find something to fill that hole,” he explains. “I decided to come back home to Derry.”  PICTURED:Jobby Crossan in his Sunderland days. He was a prolic striker, scoring  goals in his  appearnces for the club between  and . That particular hole in his le was filled by a sports shop in Pennyburn he bought in the late s.“I bought the shop from a friend of mine, Raymond Daly. I thought I knew a bit about sport and this might do. I was entering a business I knew something about.” Jobby’s Sports Centre was born.You think of Barcelona’s great club motto – Meacutes que unclub . Well Jobby’s became more than a shop.Almost from its inception the place became a magnet for friends – old and new – to congregate to chat about football, to hotly debate, to blether, but above all  to laugh.This has been the case for over four decades now, and, like the proprietor himself, shows little sign of slowing down. Not dissimilar to the barber shop scenes in Coming To America, the cast in Jobby’s Sports Centre ies from day to day. But it never empties.Joe Quigg, Roger ODoherty, Donal Ferry, Bobby Ross were all in attendance on this particular wet and windy Monday morning.Charlie Johnstone calls, as does Wee Black Joe Doherty, Harry Nelis and Noel Crampsie.Joe Doherty comes down from Strabane to chew the fat on all matters cricket related.On Thursdays Jimmy Blair, an old friend from Jobby’s playing days, Harry O’Kane and Alfie Taylor make the trek up from Coleraine without fail.Sometimes there aren’t enough chairs to go round and the host perches himself on a low hanging shelf, when he’s not ferrying tea back and forth.  PICTURED: Old friends: Jobby Crossan catches up with another well-known local football figure Gerry Doherty. They huddle around a gas heater that owes them nothing, swapping stories, slagging, telling tall tales – all cloaked with that quintessentially Derry sense of humour, based on familiarity and gentle ribbing.“These boys would come into the shop and I thought they’d keep me on the straight and narrow. Turns out they just kept me on the narrow, and drank all my tea,” explains the host. “I go through three kettles a year!”Stories abound of local players, local teams, past and present. Their love of the game still undimmed, and the warmth among this band of brothers is evident.Football connects people. And sometimes those connections last a letime.Jobby, of course, has encountered more than most.“I’ve met three kings. The Swedish, Belgian and Norwegian Kings,” insists Crossan, very matter-of-factly.In , before his debut for Northern Ireland against England, he met Field Marshall Montgomery at Wembley.Crossan re-tells the occasion with a photographic recall.“You’re from my neck of the woods old spud ” says Crossan in a posh English accent to the mirth of his companions.“Nearby” replied Jobby. “You’re from Moville and I’m from Derry.”“Very good,” came back Montgomery, “Have a good game!”, again to enthusiastic laughter.“But that’s how it is in football. You run round making friends, and there was I from the Brandywell in Derry rubbing shoulders with a World War  general.”Jobby, of course, became great friends with George Best and the Derry man has nothing but fond memories of his old Manchester housemate and international team-mate.“Not for publication!” he says with a glint in his eye when asked did he have any stories he’d like to share.“George was one of the greats. There were good players about like Pele and Di Stefano, but George played in a league where they would kicks lumps out you. Players went out to nail him. But George was unique, a class of his own. He was more or less reared in my house in Manchester. We never got peace. One Friday afternoon we had two Miss Worlds in.”“George had them both!” jumps in Donal Ferry, again to roars of laughter.  PICTURED: Jobby pictured with manager Joe Mercer and his Manchester City teammates The bond between friends get much stronger with age, according to a recent study from the University of Michigan. Friendships play a key role in health and happiness – especially as we get older.The study wasn’t written about Jobby Crossan and his friends in the shop, but it might as well have been.Former East Stirling and Derry City player Bobby Ross would be the longest serving attendee at Jobby’s.Indeed, the two veterans had been playing in a weekly five-aside game at the Templemore Complex up until last year when a locked cartilage finally brought an end to the great man’s career at the age of .“Cut short in my prime!” Jobby quips, only half joking and ever the competitor.“I’ve been coming in here from the start,” says his friend Bobby in a soft Scottish accent that hasn’t left him despite living in these shores as long as the shop has been open.“Sure, I’ve nothing  to bloody well do!”“No, the craic’s good,” he continues, “the craic’s always very good in here. It soon passes an hour or two and you can get tea and coffee any time. And you might get an odd bun!”In a final poignant moment he confesses: “No, I’d be lost without it to tell you the truth.”Bobby Ross seems to speak for them all when he says these words.At the close of business, the gas heater is switched off, the lights dimmed and the shutter comes down once more.The front door key still refuses to play ball, especially in these dark nights, before it finally turns in the lock.But this is far from daily drudgery, it’s a labour of love.In the sweetness of friendship let there be conversation and laughter, for in the dew of the morning that is where the heart is refreshed and stays forever young.Jobby’s Sports Centre – more than a shop.

At , the long-time proprietor of a Pennyburn sports shop is a le-affirming example to others of how to live a meaningful le after sporting retirement, thanks to the enduring power of friendship.  He pulls up the metal shutters of the shop and fights with the key as it struggles to unlock the door.It’s a short trip from home to his premises in Pennyburn but it’s a well-trodden path for a man now in his s.With a local paper snuggly secured under his armpit he’s made this journey in rain, hail and shine. Through good times and bad.It’s the same old routine every morning, one well-rehearsed over  years of business. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Jobby’s Sports Centre opened in the late s after he bought it from his friend Raymond Daly. I was entering a business I knew something about,’ Jobby says now. Picture: Tom Heaney  But this is no ordinary shop, and this is no ordinary shopkeeper.John Hume can probably hold claim to be Derry’s most famous living citizen. But without any shadow of a doubt, the Maiden City’s most famous sporting son is John ‘Jobby’ Crossan.Crossan needs no introduction in these parts, but for the benefit of the uninitiated ‘Jobby’ Crossan was born in  at Hamilton Street in Derry.A precocious talent Crossan played as an inside forwardfor his hometown team, Derry City. His performances quickly garnered the attention of the top scouts from England, where thespoke of the -year-old wonder boy of Irish soccer … Irelands Jimmy Greaves. In August  he joined Sparta Rotterdam, before making his debut for Ireland against England at Wembley. But more of that game later.Crossan joined Standard Liegravege in , playing for the Belgian side in a European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid.Ian Rush may have famously described playing in Italy like being in a foreign country, but the Derry man negotiated this precarious new le abroad with all the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Fully focused: team captain Crossan leads out Manchester City, a club he joined after a successful spell at Sunderland. He moved on to Middlebrough in .  “It was great,” he enthused. “I thoroughly enjoyed it. I might have been lucky as a player but obviously I could play a wee bit. We learned a couple of languages and things. We were fortunate because we were winning matches, playing for trophies. Played against the top teams. We played Real Madrid in the semi-final of the  European Cup. We beat Rangers in the quarter-finals and I happened to get two goals.”In September  he moved to Sunderland, the start of a successful eight-year spell in England that also took him to Manchester Cityand Middlesbrough.In a European Championship qualier against Poland he scored one of the finest goals that Windsor Park has ever witnessed, a spectacular and acrobatic volley from  yards. And in a World Cup preliminary game Crossan scored three against Albania.He retired from the professional game in .But this isn’t a feature about a footballer, a special talent, a shopkeeper. That tale has been told before.This is a story about something more important than that.This is a story of friendship.Upon retirement Crossan faced the same dilemma as most professional sportsmen – how to fill the void.“Your whole world changes and you have to find something to fill that hole,” he explains. “I decided to come back home to Derry.”  PICTURED:Jobby Crossan in his Sunderland days. He was a prolic striker, scoring  goals in his  appearnces for the club between  and . That particular hole in his le was filled by a sports shop in Pennyburn he bought in the late s.“I bought the shop from a friend of mine, Raymond Daly. I thought I knew a bit about sport and this might do. I was entering a business I knew something about.” Jobby’s Sports Centre was born.You think of Barcelona’s great club motto – Meacutes que unclub . Well Jobby’s became more than a shop.Almost from its inception the place became a magnet for friends – old and new – to congregate to chat about football, to hotly debate, to blether, but above all  to laugh.This has been the case for over four decades now, and, like the proprietor himself, shows little sign of slowing down. Not dissimilar to the barber shop scenes in Coming To America, the cast in Jobby’s Sports Centre ies from day to day. But it never empties.Joe Quigg, Roger ODoherty, Donal Ferry, Bobby Ross were all in attendance on this particular wet and windy Monday morning.Charlie Johnstone calls, as does Wee Black Joe Doherty, Harry Nelis and Noel Crampsie.Joe Doherty comes down from Strabane to chew the fat on all matters cricket related.On Thursdays Jimmy Blair, an old friend from Jobby’s playing days, Harry O’Kane and Alfie Taylor make the trek up from Coleraine without fail.Sometimes there aren’t enough chairs to go round and the host perches himself on a low hanging shelf, when he’s not ferrying tea back and forth.  PICTURED: Old friends: Jobby Crossan catches up with another well-known local football figure Gerry Doherty. They huddle around a gas heater that owes them nothing, swapping stories, slagging, telling tall tales – all cloaked with that quintessentially Derry sense of humour, based on familiarity and gentle ribbing.“These boys would come into the shop and I thought they’d keep me on the straight and narrow. Turns out they just kept me on the narrow, and drank all my tea,” explains the host. “I go through three kettles a year!”Stories abound of local players, local teams, past and present. Their love of the game still undimmed, and the warmth among this band of brothers is evident.Football connects people. And sometimes those connections last a letime.Jobby, of course, has encountered more than most.“I’ve met three kings. The Swedish, Belgian and Norwegian Kings,” insists Crossan, very matter-of-factly.In , before his debut for Northern Ireland against England, he met Field Marshall Montgomery at Wembley.Crossan re-tells the occasion with a photographic recall.“You’re from my neck of the woods old spud ” says Crossan in a posh English accent to the mirth of his companions.“Nearby” replied Jobby. “You’re from Moville and I’m from Derry.”“Very good,” came back Montgomery, “Have a good game!”, again to enthusiastic laughter.“But that’s how it is in football. You run round making friends, and there was I from the Brandywell in Derry rubbing shoulders with a World War  general.”Jobby, of course, became great friends with George Best and the Derry man has nothing but fond memories of his old Manchester housemate and international team-mate.“Not for publication!” he says with a glint in his eye when asked did he have any stories he’d like to share.“George was one of the greats. There were good players about like Pele and Di Stefano, but George played in a league where they would kicks lumps out you. Players went out to nail him. But George was unique, a class of his own. He was more or less reared in my house in Manchester. We never got peace. One Friday afternoon we had two Miss Worlds in.”“George had them both!” jumps in Donal Ferry, again to roars of laughter.  PICTURED: Jobby pictured with manager Joe Mercer and his Manchester City teammates The bond between friends get much stronger with age, according to a recent study from the University of Michigan. Friendships play a key role in health and happiness – especially as we get older.The study wasn’t written about Jobby Crossan and his friends in the shop, but it might as well have been.Former East Stirling and Derry City player Bobby Ross would be the longest serving attendee at Jobby’s.Indeed, the two veterans had been playing in a weekly five-aside game at the Templemore Complex up until last year when a locked cartilage finally brought an end to the great man’s career at the age of .“Cut short in my prime!” Jobby quips, only half joking and ever the competitor.“I’ve been coming in here from the start,” says his friend Bobby in a soft Scottish accent that hasn’t left him despite living in these shores as long as the shop has been open.“Sure, I’ve nothing  to bloody well do!”“No, the craic’s good,” he continues, “the craic’s always very good in here. It soon passes an hour or two and you can get tea and coffee any time. And you might get an odd bun!”In a final poignant moment he confesses: “No, I’d be lost without it to tell you the truth.”Bobby Ross seems to speak for them all when he says these words.At the close of business, the gas heater is switched off, the lights dimmed and the shutter comes down once more.The front door key still refuses to play ball, especially in these dark nights, before it finally turns in the lock.But this is far from daily drudgery, it’s a labour of love.In the sweetness of friendship let there be conversation and laughter, for in the dew of the morning that is where the heart is refreshed and stays forever young.Jobby’s Sports Centre – more than a shop.

Edwardstone has won two of his three starts over hurdles and would have beaten Stolen Silver last time out had he not hung left on the run-in on appalling ground. Hes seen to best effect on soft or good to soft and will benefit from a strong pace. The Supreme is often run at a frantic pace and that will play to his strengths. Hell be held up in fourth or fth and could be staying on strongest up the hill. With bookmakers paying four and five places on the eachway market, this horse is tremendous value. googletag.cmd.push : - FAKIR DOUDARIES  - Course form is important at Cheltenham and thats why Fakir DOudaries, fourth in last years Supreme Novice Hurdle, is getting the nod here. This race has been won by an Irish-trained horse in four of the last five years and we again dominate the market with Fakir DOudaries and Notebook of Henry De Bromheads yard. Fakir DOudaries lost to that rival last time out but connections have admitted tactics were wrong that day. He also found himself short of room up the inside and was forced out. Nonetheless, he was only beaten a little over aby Notebook. He saw out the hill well last year after a fast-run Supreme and is a Grade  winner over fences thanks to an incredible - win in the Drinmore at Fairyhouse in December. This horse jumps well and will be ridden patiently for a strong finish. Expect him to be right in the frame as they hit the last. googletag.cmd.push : - DISCORAMA  - Continuing the trend of course form being king at Cheltenham, this horse could be one of the best-handicapped of the week. Paul Nolan is a somewhat forgotten man in Irish racing but he has his string in good form and could land a couple of winners this week. This lad could be one of them, despite losing his last two races by a cumulative  s. He has had a wind operation since then and also has some serious form in the book. Looking at Cheltenham, he was second in the Martin Pipe in  and looked all over the winner of the four-miler last year before given way to Le Breuil at the line. He has shaped as a proper staying chaser without really taking flight. He hasnt won a chase race since his first over fences at Naas back in November , but dont hold that against him either. He was second to Delta Work, relegating Ryanair Chase favourite A Plus Tard to third in a Grade  at Punchestown last April and was just the s down on many peoples idea of a winner this week, Champagne Classic, before his withdrawal. That run behind Delta Work is the best in the book andhe comes back to that form and laps up Cheltenham again, he could be powering up the hill in front come pm on Tuesday. : - DARVER STAR  - This would be somewhat of a fairytale for his Louth owners, but in a very open and relatively weak Champion Hurdle, this horse could outlast them all up the hill. While unlike a future champion winner, he picked up his first win in a handicap hurdle at Wexford in April last year after five unsuccessful trips to the track before that. He was rated  in that Wexford race but has had a meteoric rise since then. Hes won four times in the intervening period, including a listed race in Limerick last October, but it is his performances in defeat in graded company that catch the eye most of all. After his fourth win on the spin, he went up against Ballymore favourite Envoi Allen at Fairyhouse in December. He was a   outsider but admirably finished just four s behind Envoi Allen. That was good enough form but may have been written off as a flukeDarver Star didnt follow it up with something similar. He did just that and probably surpassed that display by running Honeysuckle very close at Leopardstown last month. He was slow enough to get into stride but after the last, he was gaining ground on Henry De Bromheads star and market principle in the Mares Hurdle all the way to the line. He was denied by half abut beat the likes of Petit Mouchoir and Supasundae in the process. : - STORMY IRELAND  - I accept that this race is a match between Benie Des Dieux and Honeysuckle but the former is   and while I think shell win, Im going to the place market. As evidenced last year when Benie Des Dieux fell at the last while streaking clear, anything can happen in racing. If one or both of the top two in the market misfire, Stormy Ireland is best placed to pick up the pieces. She was second in this race last year and is evidently a better horse this term. She was runner-up on two occasions leading into last years festival but has won three on the spin this winter. She won all three at her ease by a combined  s. Shell be staying better than most up the hill and could even spring a surprise on one of the big players. Ill be surprisedshes out of the first three home. : - LORD SCHNITZEL  - A race for an eachway bet so how about a   shot. Lord Schnitzel could land a shock here based off two decent runs in a form book littered with poor displays. He finished just three s behind Carefully Selected last November and finished ahead of the likes of Glenloe in a race won by Faugheen a couple of weeks earlier. This is his best trip ands while he deserves to be  , hes capable of putting in a performance on his day. At a shorter price, Espoir De Guyeis a rapid improver with a nice profile. : - LORD DU MESNIL  - This notorious slog has been shortened somewhat this year but you still need a horse that stays all day to tackle the Cheltenham hill after running three and a half miles. Having finished second in a Grand National trial at Haydock last time out, Lord Du Mesnil fits that bill superbly. He is a distance specialist and has a top jockey on board in Sam Whaley-Cohen. Before that National trial, Lord Du Mesnil beat decent yardstick Perfect Candidate by nine s. He has won three times this season, improving on each occasion. Carefully Selected is the big gamble of this race for Willie Mullins but is prone to a mistake, a trait which could cost him over this gruelling trip at Cheltenham.

Two early Cahir Higgins frees saw the Derry champions open up an early lead, but they were dealt a blow on  minutes when Conor Love reacted quickest to a breaking ball and fired low past Cahir Hasson to give Enniskillen the lead. Dungiven then suffered a double whammy. First they lost midfielder Daire McKeever to a red card for his part unsavoury post-goal exchanges, and then Cahir Higgins saw his penalty superbly turned around the post by Gaels goalkeeper Cian Newman. googletag.cmd.push Points from Richie Mullan and Fintan Murphy edged Dungiven in front before the break and Feargal Higgins opened it to two points at the beginning of the second half, but Enniskillen replied strongly. Fermanagh senior list Johnny Cassidy swung over a beauty in response and a th minute Eoin Beacom point levelled matters before Enniskillen took the lead. John Rehill burrowed his way along the touchline and squared for Paddy Cassidy to fist home in front of Cahir Hasson and open a three-point gap. Dungiven though were nonplussed and a brace of Richie Mullan frees either side of Cahir Higgins th minute free saw the deficit eradicated and with extra time looming, St Canices found a winner. googletag.cmd.push Feargal Higgins collected the ball in the full-forward line, held off his marker and squeezed over a right-footed effort on  minutes almost from the end line. Conor Kelly then fired over the insurance point on the stroke of the final whistle and ensured Dungiven’s progress to an intriguing semi-final meeting with St Eunan’s of Letterkenny.

LONGHOUSE POET  could be the one to chase him home at a nice price. He has some nice form in the book having finished just seven s behind Envoi Allen in Naas in January and just two s behind Albert Bartlett favourite Latest Exhibition next time out at Leopardstown. He improved between those runs, evidenced by his reversal of form with Elixir DAnaiy in those two starts. He was just over three s behind that rival at Naas but a similar distance ahead of him at Leopardstown. He can continue that upward curve here. Hell act on the ground and should stay out the trip on the testing ground. googletag.cmd.push : - ALLAHO  gets the vote here after improving massively from his first to second chase start this winter. On his debut over fences, he was just over abehind stablemate Easy Game but improved and looked a real prospect in beating Milan Native by  s at Fairyhouse in January. The fact that Paul Townend will be on his back on Wednesday suggests hes outperforming Easy Game at home and will carry Willie Mullins main hope in this race. He also has Cheltenham form, albeit over hurdles, having been third behind the re-opposing Minella Indo in last years Albert Bartlett. He looks a natural chaser and will handle the testing ground very well. It may be an omen that he was sired by a horse called No Risk At All. Heres hoping! googletag.cmd.push : - There are a couple of improvers here well ahead of the handicapper but my slight preference is for ALFA MIX  over Stratum. JP McManus loves Cheltenham winners and it could be signicant that he purchased Alfa Mix between his last run and today. On that last run at Navan, he travelled like a dream and ranged up before a mistake two out halted his chances of beating the top weight here today, Kilfenora. Gavin Cromwell trains this one and has his horses in brilliant form. He was third in the Champion Hurdle on Tuesday with Darver Star and could get into the winners enclosure with this one. He beat a number of these rivals on his previous run, also at Navan, where the likes of Cracking Smart and Top Moon were behind him. That was admittedly off a low weight but hes been given a chance by the handicapper and has been put away since January for this race. Hell travel better than most and with some luck in running, hell be coming up the hill in front. : - With Altior withdrawn on Tuesday, this is now a match between Defi Du Seuil and my selection CHACUN POUR SOI . This horse is one of the best Willie Mullins has for the next couple of seasons and has already beaten Defi Du Seuil at Punchestown last year. That was at the end of a season for Defi Du Seuil but the manner in which Chacun Pour Soi outlasted him to the line was impressive. Also on official ratings, Chacun Pour Soi achieved the best performance of this year of any of these horses by some distance. That came when he beat Min by over three s at Leopardstown at the Dublin Racing Festival last month. The ground is a slight unknown but that victory over Min was on yielding to soft and his seasonal re-appearance, when he was three s behind A Plus Tard, was on soft to heavy. I think hell handle it and will have the finish to pip Defi Du Seuil up the hill. : - I hope Im wrong but I think Tiger Roll will be beaten here by a horse called EASYSLAND . He is a cross country specialist and while Tiger Roll was a - winner in this last year, there was nothing as good as this French import in the line-up. Easysland is unbeaten over the ditches in six starts, mostly in France, but prepped for this by travelling to Cheltenham and winning the cross country last December. He made two mistakes late that day but still stayed on to win by seven, beating some of these on the day. Hell be ridden prominently so as to stay out of trouble and could upset the favourite backers. Tiger Roll has bigger fish to fry in the Grand National next month. He hasnt had as smooth a preparation this year for this pitstop and could go down to a second defeat of the season. : - I wouldnt have a strong opinion on this but TRONADOR  is interesting for Gordon Elliott. He has twice won this race with big price winners, including Veneer of Charm who won at   in . Tronador has been tucked away for this race and will go off a nice handy weight with a top jockey in Denis ORegan on board. This horse has also got a few mentions in Cheltenham previews, including from Gordon Elliott himself. This could be a gamble on track on the day, although the preference of his stablemate Aramax in the field might keep him at a nice eachway price. : - Appreciate Itis the talking horse for Willie Mullins in this but its a race that has thrown up a couple of shocking results in recent years. I was taken with DARLING DAUGHTER  when she won unexpectedly at odds of   at Leopardstown last month. She tracked the leaders in a nice spot that day and found plenty when asked to go for home two furlongs out by Lisa ONeill. She beat Politesse that day with that rival franking the form by beating Watergate Lady by five s at Thurles a couple of weeks later. The latter has decent form tied in with Appreciate It and Asterion Forlonge who was fourth in the Supreme on Tuesday. That gives Darling Daughter a chance and her mares allowance will go a long way on testing ground. She could run a big race at a big price.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies. This support has helped secure almost poundm of investment and is helping companies to create , jobs, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoIn direct response to Mr Hazzardrsquos comment that our focus is solely directed at investors in Belfast, in the last five years nearly % of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast and nearly % of Invest NIrsquos offers are to companies outside of Belfast.The spokeswoman said it was solely a companyrsquos decision on where it wished to visit and locate, based on its business needs.She added: ldquoThe vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations or, in some cases, the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our headquarters in Belfast which is why the Belfast figures are high.ldquoSteering an investor to locate in any one area that does not meet their requirements would be both counterproductive and damaging to Northern Irelandrsquos investment reputation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Late RUGBY.jpg","title":"Late Lansdowne try leaves ‘Hinch in relegation spot  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH suffered heartbreak on Saturday in their battle to avoid relegation from the ultra competitive AIL Division A as their Dublin opponents stole the result at the death, despite a much-improved Ballynahinch performance.The articial surface at Aviva Stadiumrsquos back pitch was the venue and the large travelling support braved Storm Jorge to roar their men on.It looked like turning into a famous victory until powerful Leinster Academy hooker Dan Sheehan drove over in the dying moments of a hard-fought match to seal victory for the home side and avenge their seven try thumping at Ballymacarn Park in November.Brian McLaughlin had made a few changes to his starting back line with Aaron Cairns moving into scrum half and Greg Hutley earning his first AIL start at out half. Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With Brexit now a reality, future payments are at risk and farmers face a huge shortfall in income.“The money received was for a iety of schemes under the Single Farm Payment and does not include other schemes under Pillar .“The potential loss of this income is real and present, only last week it was revealed in a leaked memo from a top Downing Street official that the ‘Uk could prosper without an agri-food sector’. That shows the intent in Downing street.Mr. O’Dowd said: “The loss of tens of millions of pounds of income to Upper Bann farmers will have a devastating impact on the local economy.“This money was spent in local shops, suppliers and hardware stores. “The farmer’s loss will be a loss to us all and is as a direct result of the reckless pursuit of the Brexit agenda.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are  most popular dog breeds uk ","story":"PSNI colleagues pay tribute to Constable Stephen Carroll on th anniversary of his murderFairgreen recycling centre shutsNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleDogs : Other rd PartyThese are the  most popular dog breeds in the UKEveryone has their favourite breed of dog - which is yours By Helen JohnsonMonday, th March , : pmUpdated Monday, th March , : pm\"\"Research conducted by Dogfriendlycottages found that these are the  most popular dog breeds in the UK - do you agree .

To be left in a bus for hours and site and play with your Lego was very brave.“When I read your story it brought tears to my eyes and still does. Your mum and dad must be very proud of you.“I am sending you some wee pictures for your room and a little gt. Ask your mum and dad to buy you something special from me.

We wanted to put something in the paper to thank this man and his we.“ He must live somewhere in NI.”She also wants to thank all her family and friends for the gts and cards which they had sent to Ryan.The Calvert family had been very upset at the ‘serious neglect’ of Ryan on February  when he was left alone on the private bus, hired by the Education Authority.Mr Calvert had taken Ryan, as usual, to the bus close to their home at Portadown at .am. Ryan was supposed to have been taken to the Learning Support Centre. But his father later discovered he didn’t arrive until noon that day. “We were left in shock,” Mr Calvert said.A spokesperson for the Education Authority commented: “We can confirm we are investigating the circumstances surrounding an incident on a contracted private hire route involving a pupil attending Edenderry Primary School on Wednesday  February . On becoming aware of this incident, we took immediate action as the safety and well-being of pupils is our primary concern.“We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously and have offered our unreserved apology to the pupil and their parents. As this matter is under investigation no further comment can be made as it may be prejudicial to the process.” Edenderry PS principal Stephen Doyle said they were ‘very concerned about this child being left on the bus’.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
