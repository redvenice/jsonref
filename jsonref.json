It is unclear if any more are still set to be brought in from previous deals. The Department of Health paid out roughly £585million on contracts securing visors.This suggests ministers paid the equivalent of nearly £4.80 per visor used, roughly 24 times more than the shields cost when bought in bulk. And of its surplus stock, 339,154,151 are deemed \u0027not fit for use in healthcare settings\u0027. SAGE advisors warned visors were unlikely to give \u0027any protection\u0027 against Covid transmission in July 2020, with the Government placing its last order for visors at the end of June 2020.A Department of Health spokesperson said: \u0027Our priority throughout the pandemic has been saving lives, and we have delivered over 19.1 billion items of PPE to frontline staff to keep them safe.\u0027Having too much PPE was preferable to having too little in the face of an unpredictable and dangerous virus, given this was essential to keep our NHS open and protect as many people as possible.\u0027Now we are confident we have sufficient PPE to cover any future Covid demands, we are taking decisive action to save up to £93 million of taxpayers\u0027 money per year by reducing storage costs for excess stock.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Le Pen closes gap Macron French election campaigns ends today ahead vote Sunday","story":"Share this articleLe Pen’s National Rally party is still paying off a loan worth some £8million to a Russian bank.The far-right leader has long been a firm ally of Mr Putin, though she has criticised Russian war crimes in Ukraine.It comes as Le Pen continues to press for extreme policies including fines for Muslim women who use headscarves to cover their faces in public.‘People will be given a fine in the same way that they are for illegally not wearing seat belts,’ she suggested. Le Pen has also pledged to cut immigration by as much as 75 per cent and to clamp down on new arrivals from bringing their families to France.Le Pen\u0027s efforts to moderate her far-right image were boosted by the candidacy of the even more radical candidate ex-TV pundit Éric Zemmour. Veteran Left wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon was also enjoying a rise in his poll figures. He is expected to win around 17 per cent in the first round, and could feasibly pip Le Pen to a place in the second round run-off.That would be a relief for Mr Macron, a former banker and civil servant who formed his own political movement to challenge for power.He hopes to become the first sitting French president to be re-elected for 20 years. The last head of state to achieve this was Jacques Chirac, who was elected president in 1997 before gaining a second, final term in 2002. The first round of this year\u0027s presidential election will take place on Sunday, with the top two candidates going head-to-head two weekends later on April 24."},{"url":null,"title":"easyJet slammed sharing photo customer flight number tattooed wrist","story":"Share this article Another social media user responded: \u0027Holy s***.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Long security queues at Dublin airport on Friday morning were partly as a result of passengers arriving “significantly earlier” than their flight departure times, the operator of the facility has said.Members of the public posted images and videos of lengthy queues at Dublin Airport on social media on Friday. It came after passengers last month missed flights due to delays at security.DAA, which operates the airport, confirmed there were some “significant waiting times” between the hours of 2.30am and 4.30am, with some passengers waiting up to 70 minutes to pass through security. “This was partly due to a large number of passengers arriving significantly earlier than forecast, ahead of flights that were departing much later in the morning,” Graeme McQueen, media relations manager at DAA, said.“Queue times reduced quickly and considerably once additional security lanes were opened, as planned, to align with passengers arriving around three-and-a-half hours before their departure times.”Mr McQueen thanked passengers for heeding its advice to arrive up to threeand-a-half hours ahead of their scheduled departure slot.“In the days and weeks to come, adhering to this advice, rather than arriving at the airport much earlier, will help passengers get through security screening as quickly as possible,” he added.“As the number of passengers travelling through Dublin Airport continues to increase over the coming period, DAA continues to refine and adapt its security screening operation, to ensure that all passengers can pass through security in plenty of time to make their flights.”The recent delays at Dublin Airport have been attributed to a shortage of security staff following the collapse of international travel during the Covid-19 pandemic.“The shortage of security screening staff is the main reason for the current issues. While there have been no constraints on recruitment - more than 100 new security staff have already been recruited so far this year - DAA is re-doubling its efforts to more staff,” Mr McQueen said.Some 250 candidates were invited for interview this week, with almost 100 of those candidates to receive employment offers.“Bringing recruits into the operation had been delayed recently by the requirement for enhanced background checks for aviation workers which came into effect on January 1st this year. Thankfully, however, this logjam is now easing.”DAA is also exploring other short-term options to increase security staff numbers, including identifying former security screening staff who are now in different roles in the company, and temporarily re-assigning a number of Cork-based staff to Dublin.The company recently faced political backlash about the pay rates it was offering to prospective staff, which were in the €14-€21 per hour range. It also emerged that it was seeking security staff to be available for 40 hours per week, while they were only being guaranteed 20 hours’ work with a minimum weekly salary of €283.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british government minister accepts further dialogue required on border move","story":"The proposed changes to immigration laws were discussed on Monday. Photograph: EPAAndy RainA British government minister has accepted that “further dialogue” is required with the Irish government over a controversial US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of proposed changes to immigration laws.During a debate in the House of Lords on Monday prior to a vote, the planned pre-travel clearance checks for those entering Northern Ireland were branded “unworkable”, with members urging the UK Lords Minister, Susan Williams (Baroness Williams of Trafford) to “make concessions”.Responding to criticism about lack of communication with the Irish Government and tourist chiefs, she said: “We do accept the need for further dialogue with interlocuters including the Irish government, Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland. I totally accept that point.”Last Tuesday, Westminster MPs voted to reinstate the proposal for an electronic waiver following an amendment by the House of Lords to exempt Northern Ireland from the new legislation. The day after the Commons challenge, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said as far as he was concerned, it had not been finalised. He described the decision as “regrettable”.Coming under the British government’s Nationalities and Borders Bill, the proposal will require EU citizens who are not Irish will to apply online for pre-travel clearance -known as Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - before entering the UK, including when crossing the Border into the North.Addressing the Lords on Monday after submitting an amendment, Paul Murphy (Baron Murphy of Torfaen) said he was “hopeful the Minister would have spoken to her colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office and would have made some concessions on this”. “But the dead hand of the Home Office is there again,” he added.The former Northern Ireland Secretary of State said he was “troubled” by the introduction of an ETA, at a cost of €14, saying it would severely impact on tourism, cross-border health services and the “spirit of the Good Friday Agreement” .“Is it really worth jeopardising our (BritishIrish) relationship which is bad enough as it is over the last number of years by this petty and silly proposal by the government...I hope the government will change its mind but I’m not hopeful.”The planned change to the law will also apply to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) living in the State, which includes people from Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.Non-British or non-Irish citizens from other countries, outside the EUEEA, which previously did not require a visa to enter the UK, will now need an ETA.Former SDLP leader Margaret Richie also expressed her opposition, saying the ETA scheme was “unworkable”.“It is unenforceable and would violate the very premise of reconciliation in terms of the Good Friday Agreement,” she told the Lords.She asked the UK minister to “consider the geography” of Border towns and villages, saying: “I believe the Home Office hasn’t fully considered that.” “There’s one village that straddles both Donegal and Fermanagh, that is the small village of Pettigo where that Border goes straight down the middle.“Within one minute you could be in the Republic of Ireland and the next minute, you could be in Northern Ireland.” She queried what discussions had taken with the Irish Government as well tourism organisations.The human rights NGO, the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ), has also condemned the move, which it said was “unworkable and risks a hard border for many non-British and non-Irish citizens in Border communities who have been able to freely cross the Border to date”.Baroness Williams — who described herself as “an Irish woman with a father from Northern Ireland” — indicated however that the ETA plan was likely to be passed. “Once the EU’s come into force next year, Ireland will stand out as one of the few countries in Europe without an ETA style pass,” she said.Referring to tourism, she said that “once granted, an ETA will be valid for multiple trips to the UK”, and that the cost is “likely to be small and unlikely to be a deterrent for visitors”.“Moreover, many of the UK’s international partners have taken a similar approach to border security...It is a very familiar concept for travellers,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach calls for pause ahead of report on holohan secondment","story":"Dr Tony Holohan announced last month he was stepping down from his position as chief medical officer to take on the new role at Trinity College Dublin. Photograph: The Taoiseach Micheál Martin has called for a “pause” and “reassessment” around the planned secondment of Dr Tony Holohan to Trinity College before the Government receives a report on the process next week.Speaking in Helsinki, Mr Martin said there must be transparency around the move.Dr Holohan was announced as the professor of public health strategy and leadership at Trinity on March 25th, a role which will involve learning the lessons of Covid and preparing for future health challenges.The appointment sparked controversy this week when it emerged in recent days that the Department of Health would fund the role and continue to pay Dr Holohan’s annual salary of €187,000.A private meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Health on Thursday heard that Department of Health secretary general Robert Watt signed off on the secondment.“I’ve asked the Minister for Health for the full report on the entire process that led up to this appointment and the Minister has asked the secretary general of the Department of Health for that report,” said the Taoiseach.“There seems to be have been a number of strands to this, in respect of a research strand. We all understand the merit in creating additional capacity to create a research platform around pandemic preparedness, given the experiences that we’ve had over the last two years.“In officialdom that would be one perspective, but there is a research perspective to this, there is a more medium term perspective to this. And in my view, there should be a pause, there be a reassessment as to how the objectives that are behind this can be realised in a better and more transparent way. The report will come in a number of days.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Friday said he had “assumed” Dr Holohan had applied for the Trinity role after a position came up, but that it now appeared “more complicated than that”.The nature of how the appointment was made “could have been better handled quite frankly,” he said. The Fine Gael leader said he expected the report into the matter would only take a number of days, and would be finished next week.“Because it does involve taxpayers’ money we think it’s appropriate that the appointment should be paused for a short period while we can find out exactly how it came about, and assure ourselves that procedures were correctly followed,” he said.Mr Varadkar said “there may not have been” a need for Dr Holohan to move into the academic position on secondment from the Department of Health, which was one aspect the review would examine.“Nobody in Government is happy about this because even though we were not involved in it in any way, inevitably these things do reflect on us,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the secondment of Dr Holohan was a “very different situation” to the previous controversial - and later abandoned – proposed appointment of former minister Katherine Zappone to a UN special envoy role.“That was a ministerial appointment in which Ministers were involved, this is not, this is a public appointment involving public and civil servants in which Ministers are not involved,” he added.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin health spokesman, David Cullinane, said Mr Watt should clarify his role in the process rather than be involved in producing a report on the matter requested by Government.“I think we need an examination from others, other than the people involved in the process, and that’s always the best way to establish the facts,” he told The . “Robert Watt needs to clarify was he part of these disusssions and did he sign off on it, and if he did, it would be better for someone else to do the examination.”In a statement on Thursday, the department said that “all arrangements in relation to staffing are the responsiblity of the Secretary General”.CommitteeEarlier on Fridauy, the chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform John McGuinness said that Mr Watt and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath will be asked before the committee to answer questions on the secondment of Dr Holohan.Mr McGuinness spoke of his “serious concerns” about how the secondment of Dr Holohan to Trinity College Dublin was handled by Mr Watt.“It is quite a mess within the department. It shows a certain dysfunction within the department and we need to clarify it,” Mr McGuinness told RTÉ Radio’s Morning Ireland programme.“I have serious concerns about how the department reached the decision in relation to all of this and also the fact that the Minister (for Health) was not informed. Minister McGrath was not informed.“There is still a lot of questions as to how this position was created was funded. Why there was so much secrecy around it. Why the department refused to answer questions from the very beginning.”Mr McGuinness said that every secretary general has a responsibility to appear before Oireachtas committees.“Mr Watt will be asked after the Easter recess but during the recess we will be making arrangements for that to happen. And Minister McGrath will also be asked before the committee. And indeed if the Minister of Health had a role in this well we will need to know what that is too.“But this cannot continue in terms of the management of any department. The Minister must be informed and there are certain guidelines and so on that need to be followed relative to appointments like this.”Earlier this week Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly described Dr Holohan’s new role as a “really positive move”, which he fully supports."},{"url":null,"title":"european parliament backs rule change to ensure flow of medicines to northern ireland","story":"The European Parliament has voted by an overwhelming majority to approve an EU rule change to ensure medicines can continue to flow into Northern Ireland seamlessly from Britain. File photograph: PA WireThe European Parliament has voted by an overwhelming majority to approve an EU rule change to ensure medicines can continue to flow into Northern Ireland seamlessly from Britain under post-Brexit arrangements, in a step pushed for by Irish MEPs.The derogation for Northern Ireland approved by the parliament exempts it indefinitely from requirements on medicines that usually apply within the single market, to avoid any interruption to supply in this regard for the North.It applies to both approved and experimental drugs, and will apply retrospectively from the start of this year when it comes into force imminently.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, part of the EU-UK Brexit withdrawal agreement that guarantees a special post-Brexit trading status for the region, the North is still part of the EU regulatory market for medicines, even though a large proportion of its medicines are supplied from Britain. Irish MEPs and diplomats had lobbied for the rule change to be approved and the step was welcomed.“That means important medicinal products will get to the people who need them and provides greater certainty for Northern Ireland post-Brexit, which is very welcome news indeed.”“Of the issues that bother people about the protocol, the main one is medicines,” he said. “It was a very clear message at a very sensitive time in Northern Irish politics, and I hope the message is really well received in Northern Ireland.”ConsequencesThe change to EU rules, first proposed by the European Commission in December, means that marketing authorisation holders for medicines for Northern Ireland can be located anywhere in the UK, and batch-testing can also take place in Britain.Experimental drugs manufactured in Britain can also be imported into Northern Ireland, as well as into the Republic, Cyprus, and Malta, as long as they meet conditions.The derogation for the Republic, Cyprus, and Malta is for a temporary period of three years.If medicines are given authorisation in the UK before they receive it from the European Medicines Agency, they can still be supplied to Northern Ireland under the rule change, which allows for temporary authorisations in such circumstances.The commission is set to propose a broader revision of EU pharmaceutical rules by the end of this year, which is expected to set out more permanent structural solutions to ensure the security of supply of medicines in general in smaller markets, according to a statement by the European Parliament.

For 16 years Angela Merkel’s popularity in her native Germany never fell below 50 per cent. For those who put their faith in the EU, she could do no wrong.Then, when Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, her reputation collapsed. Now her legacy lies in ruins. It is rather difficult to find a Western politician whose status has fallen off a cliff quite like Merkel’s. Ukrainians blame her for appeasing Putin and leaving them at his mercy. They recall the 2008 Bucharest summit, when George W. Bush wanted to offer Ukraine Nato membership but the Germans and French vetoed it.As the full horror of the Russian occupation emerged, Volodymyr Zelensky could not contain his wrath: “I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha, to see what the policy of 14 years of concessions has led to. The Ukrainian president called on her and the former French president “to see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women”.Even now, Angela Merkel apparently has no regrets. Her office issued a terse statement: “Former German Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel stands by her decisions in connection with the 2008 Nato summit in Bucharest.” She refuses to apologise, then, for any of the policies that have led Germany and Europe to catastrophe. Instead, Mrs Merkel is writing her memoirs, convinced that history will somehow vindicate her. Once it was fashionable to compare her with Margaret Thatcher. Yet her approach was the opposite of the Iron Lady’s. Where Mrs Thatcher stood up to tyrants, Mrs Merkel sought to accommodate them, in the naive belief that prosperity would rid Russia and China of their authoritarian regimes. Germans used to call her Mutti (“Mummy”). Not any more. Mrs Merkel is the kind of mother who, when her child is bullied and beaten up at school, refuses to confront the teachers and instead blames the victim.Her admirers used to boast that she enjoyed a uniquely honest relationship with Putin, because she could talk frankly to the Russian dictator in his own language. Yet the truth is that Mrs Merkel, the former East German, feared the former KGB thug – and he smelled her fear. In later years, they spoke only in German, enabling Putin to hold the whip hand.From the outset, there was something sadomasochistic about their relationship. When she was his guest in 2007, Putin brought his pet labrador Connie to one of their meetings, knowing that she was nervous of dogs. Yet she played along with his blatant misogyny and fell into all the geopolitical traps he had laid for her.The biggest of these traps was her decision to allow Germany to become ever more dependent on Russian energy. By the time she left office last year, Germany was importing 55 per cent of its gas, 34 per cent of its oil and 52 per cent of its coal from Russia. Her short-termist, opportunistic exit from nuclear power compounded this. Worst of all was Mrs Merkel’s stubborn support for the deeply sinister Nordstream gas pipeline project, which flew in the face of Anglo-American warnings and desperate pleas from Ukraine. She turned a blind eye to the fact that Nordstream’s chairman – her predecessor as Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder – was being bankrolled by Russian energy. Nordstream had all the hallmarks of political interference, but she insisted that it was purely commercial.Mrs Merkel is no less culpable for her failure to maintain German defences. On her watch, in the words of the Bundeswehr’s most senior general, they were “stripped bare”. She allowed German firms to sell “dual use” military equipment to Russia, but banned arms exports to Ukraine.After Putin annexed Crimea and sent his “little green men” into Ukraine’s Donbas region, the writing was on the wall. Yet Mrs Merkel persisted in “building bridges” to Russia right up to the day she left office last December. Her most senior colleagues, such as the former finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble and the former foreign minister, now President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, have admitted that it was a fatal mistake to trust the Russian president. “Today I know — I was wrong,” Schäuble says. “We were all wrong.”Not Mrs Merkel, though. She, the chief architect of the European policies that gave Putin the green light to inflict war crimes on Ukraine, has yet to show any hint of contrition.

Victoria, then 25 and a little past the peak of her first career as a Spice Girl, has a butternut-squash tan and pixie cut.Her look is accented by a rose corsage wider than her head. His look is accented by a diamante crucifix necklace, designer stubble and – squint-and-you’ll-miss-him – their four-month-old son, Brooklyn, whose outfit is cut from the same lurid cloth as his parents’, right down to his tiny cowboy hat.“THE WEDDING OF THE DECADE”, cried the next issue of OK! magazine, which had exclusive rights to the build-up, the day and the aftermath of the nuptials, on the cover of its biggest ever issue.And, with insincere apologies to Prince Edward, it really was the wedding of the decade. Everything – from the dove released when the pair said “I do” to the Robin Hood theme, scattered rose petals, and Victoria’s silk, pleated Vera Wang gown with sculpted neckline and 20ft train – made it exquisitely, exclusively 90s.“We did throw a lot at it,” recalled David on Desert Island Discs in 2017. He lamented the evening dress code – “I even had a top hat in purple... what was I thinking?” – but seemed to concede that it was all a long, long time ago.Twenty-three years, to be exact – a period in which we’ve watched Brand Beckham move on, grow up, spawn and ersify with remarkable savvy. And this weekend, its next move ought to make that evolution plain, as well as make us feel utterly ancient.It’s time for Brooklyn to lead a transatlantic merger. The joining of two houses, both alike in prosperity. Yes, the baby in the cowboy hat has lassoed a bride of his own: in a new decade, the Beckham wedding is back, and this time it’s high-end. Or, sort of high-end, anyway.A few basic details, so everyone’s up to speed: the bride-to-be is Nicola Peltz, a 27-year-old actress whom 23-year-old Brooklyn met at Coachella music festival and started dating in 2019, then proposed to with a £250,000 diamond ring 10 months later. She was wearing a Victoria Beckham dress that day. “I fall in love with you more every day,” Brooklyn wrote, on Instagram. And that was almost two years ago, meaning he must be super keen on her now.Peltz has appeared in Transformers: Age of Extinction, the Psycho prequel Bates Motel and several music videos, but she’s also, helpfully, an heiress. Her parents are US businessman Nelson Peltz, who has an estimated fortune of more than £1.3 billion, and his third wife, former model Claudia Heffner Peltz. The poor Beckhams only have £380 million. (A prenuptial agreement has allegedly been signed.)The merger will occur tomorrow, at the Peltz family’s $76 million, 44,000 sq ft, 27-bedroom, oceanfront house in Palm Beach, Florida, after some 300 guests have enjoyed a welcome dinner this evening, and before a relaxed farewell event on Sunday.It is, friends say, “Miami society meets British celebrity”, which means that if you can think of a famous person who might be there, they probably will be. Family friends likely to attend include Gordon Ramsay, Phil Neville, Eva Longoria, the other Spice Girls and, possibly, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. One of Brooklyn’s godfathers, Sir Elton John, is on tour.Then there are the couple’s friends, many of whom are the offspring of celebrities, like Rocco Ritchie (Guy Ritchie and Madonna’s son), Anaïs Gallagher (daughter of Noel) and Nicole Ritchie (daughter of Lionel). And, of course, family, who fill all the major roles: Romeo and Cruz, Brooklyn’s younger brothers, will act as best men, while their sister, Harper, will be a bridesmaid. Nicola’s maid-of-honour is her maternal grandmother, and her “man-of-honour” is one of her brothers, Brad. She has six (one, Will, is an actor), and one sister. Her father-in-law, David, the famous wit, will be master of ceremonies.Aside from being costly (£3 million, they say) and containing an overexcited Mel B, Brooklyn’s wedding has little in common with that of his parents. No doves, thrones or matching violet evening outfits are expected.For one thing, it’ll be Jewish. Despite neither bride nor groom being Jewish, it’s been reported that tomorrow’s ceremony will include glass-breaking, a yarmulke, a chuppah, a Hebrew blessing and even the signing of a ketubah. Nicola’s father is said to be a devout Jew, and Brooklyn’s great-grandfather (David’s maternal grandfather) was, too. That quite tenuous connection allegedly bonded the happy couple.Snoop Dogg, a friend of David’s and former neighbour from the Beckhams’ time in Los Angeles, will DJ at the Covid-secure reception. The bride will wear Valentino the groom will probably wear something that looks as if it was lent to him by the Peaky Blinders costume department, as he usually does.As for the Covid-tested guests, they’d better wear something very chic and very classy if they want to have a chance of having a photographic memory of the day. They’ll be banned from taking their own photos, because Vogue has the rights to exclusive imagery and coverage.Yes, Vogue. In 1999, OK! magazine reported exclusively on everything from Posh’s dress fitting (“Victoria’s Secrets: Why I want to be sexy and virginal  My tattoo surprise for David!”) to printing the speeches in full. Twenty-three years later, the fact their cowbaby has been able to sell his own wedding rights to the fashion bible instead is perhaps the clearest sign of how Brand Beckham has changed. How Vogue has changed, too.That first wedding was very much the marriage of two young people who grew up only hoping to be rich and famous – for a long time, they were just David from Chingford and Victoria from Hertfordshire. Brooklyn and Nicola, on the other hand, grew up knowing they’d never have to work a day in their lives if they didn’t want to.Theirs is as much a society wedding as a minor royal’s, then, especially given the Peltzes’ fortune. Nelson, who is 79, never graduated from university and ended up as a delivery driver for the family food distribution business. A decade and a half later, he’d grown it into a $150 million business.As a financier, Nelson went on to snaffle the soft drink Snapple from Quaker Oats, turning its fortunes around so swiftly that Cadbury Schweppes bought it in 2000. He is seen as a doyen of the food retail and distribution industries, working with Heinz and PepsiCo, among others, which has meant he’s made a lot of powerful friends.One was Donald Trump: in February 2020, Nelson hosted a fundraiser for the then-president at the same venue as tomorrow’s wedding. He withdrew his public support after the Capitol insurrection a year later.What a meeting of brands this is. In merging with the Peltzes, the Beckhams consolidate their wealth and power, probe further into US society, and gain access not only to that Florida mansion but the family’s other, 130-acre home in New York, where there is an ice rink and flock of albino peacocks.In merging with the Beckhams, the Peltzes join forces with one of the world’s most famous families, who established themselves in the US years ago, and have built themselves over the years from “footballer and pop star” to a classy but accessible level of quasi-royalty.But that’s the cynical view. The happy couple seem as in love as any bride and groom. Just hunt down their gushing Instagram tributes, tattoos and cutesy online cookery videos for evidence. Expect all that to be present this weekend. Brand Beckham has come a long way since “the wedding of the decade” – now prepare for them to define another era of celebrity.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: First stage of Kyiv\u0026#39s EU membership to begin \u0026#39within weeks\u0026#39, bloc chief saysRishi Sunak’s wife to pay UK tax on all incomePressure mounts on Rishi Sunak as he admits he held a US green card while ChancellorHow do you get a green card – and can you give one up?

But Liz Truss’s PR antics are being dialled down in favour of more “natural” shots. Spies in the Foreign Office and Downing Street, where some of her pictures had raised eyebrows, tell me there has been a deliberate shift in her communications strategy.“They’re aiming to have more photos of her working with people,” says one mole. This was triggered in particular by a photo of the Foreign Secretary astride a Triumph motorbike in Thailand, one of the more egregious examples of Ms Truss enthusiastically emulating Mrs Thatcher.Viewers of Gardeners’ World were devastated last year when Nigel, presenter Monty Don’s beloved golden retriever and a regular screen presence, died. There were then worries when Patti the Yorkshire Terrier, Nigel’s replacement, went missing from the show earlier this year, with many concerned that Monty had been doubly bereaved.I am delighted to reveal that the story has a happy ending. Patti was spooked when one of the camera rigs nearly fell on her during filming and refused to go anywhere near them (unless being cuddled by Monty) since. Despite the fright, and presumably the reduction in appearance fees, she is alive and well.The countdown is on for the arrival of a new Jilly Cooper-style “bonkbuster” set in Westminster that is sure to get tongues wagging. Cleo Watson, once a senior aide in Boris Johnson’s Downing Street, said goodbye to Government earlier this year and is focusing on completing her erotic political thriller.A mole tells me that Ms Watson, an ally of Dominic Cummings, is writing the novel from her Islington bolthole. In the morning she works on the dialogue before waiting for the evening, and the consumption of a strong martini, before turning her attention to the more amorous sections.The book follows three young protagonists as they enter the world of politics. But also featuring in the story is a charismatic, middle aged MP who has risen to the top of the political pile and does not always stay on the straight and narrow. Who ever could have been the inspiration?It was revealed this week that Rishi Sunak handed £100,000 to Winchester College, his old school. But the Chancellor isn’t the only Westminster figure to be supporting his alma mater.The former culture minister Lord Vaizey – who went to London’s £40,000-a-year St Paul’s School – tells me he remains proud of his old school links, serving as president of the Old Paulines and donating to its coffers. Intriguingly, he also suggests that George Osborne, another alumnus, is a supporter ... though he won’t say how much he gives. Osbo is remaining tightlipped, too.Nadine Dorries said this week that she hopes selling off Channel 4 will mean it can compete with the streaming giants. But does the broadcaster have an edgier business proposition in mind? Its venture capital arm has investments in Cannaray, a British cannabis firm. Industry sources now tell me that they hope that privatisation will see Channel 4 expand its involvement, possibly opening the door to advertising on the network. Would a tie-up be enough to lure trendy young urbanites back to the channel?A wave of anti-Sackler iconoclasm continues to sweep London. Peterborough reported last month that Roland Rudd, chair of the Tate Britain and Tate Modern, had removed all reference to the family, who founded a pharmaceutical firm accused of worsening the US opioid crisis. Now I hear similar rumblings from the London Library in St James’s – founded by Thomas Carlyle in 1841 and frequented by the likes of Dickens, Gladstone and Churchill. Members in its private reading rooms might now spot Simon Schama, Andrew Marr or Stephen Fry lurking among the stacks.“Following a decision by the Board of Trustees, we shall be removing the Sackler name from our small reading room currently known as the Sackler Study,” said an email to members this week. “This room will now be referred to as The Study.” Catchy.Peterborough, published every Friday at 7pm, is edited by Christopher Hope, the \u0027s chief political correspondent and the author of the daily Chopper\u0027s Politics newsletter.

Palace sources say she made the decision a week in advance in order to avoid arrangements for the service being thrown into upheaval.The annual event is an important fixture in the royal calendar and will see Charles follow the ancient tradition of distributing Maundy money to leading members of the community on Thursday.It is understood the Queen, who has been experiencing mobility problems, was unable to commit to the event and, with the order of service being printed, was keen for the arrangements to be confirmed to avoid the day being overshadowed.A palace source said: Mobility issues which emerge make it difficult for the Queen to predict in advance whether she can attend a particular event. If an event requires advance notice for the printing of orders of service and other material, such as Royal Maundy, that makes it much harder.She felt it would be best to make it clear at this stage that she would not be attending, in order not to overshadow the service by pulling out closer to the time.The monarch attended the service commemorating the life of the Duke of Edinburgh last month and has been carrying out virtual events and her other duties as head of state.She was forced to miss November\u0027s Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in London after spraining her back. The service would have been her first duty in public after her hospital stay the previous month, when she underwent a series of checks.The Queen has been present for all but four Royal Maundy services of her reign. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother stepped in to represent her in 1960 because Prince Andrew was only a few weeks old.Four years later Princess Mary, Princess Royal, stood in for the Queen because Prince Edward had just been born.She was also absent twice while visiting other parts of the Commonwealth, most recently in 1970. She first attended Royal Maundy as Princess Elizabeth of York in 1935.The Queen has been present for all but four Royal Maundy services in her reign. She was absent twice following childbirth, and twice because she was visiting other parts of the Commonwealth. She first attended Royal Maundy as Princess Elizabeth of York in 1935.Charles and Camilla will join the congregation for the Royal Maundy service. The Queen will have been reluctant to cancel her appearance at the service, which she regards as an important element of her ceremonial and religious duties. It is the only occasion on which she visits others to make awards rather than the recipients of honours coming to her.Recipients of Maundy money were traditionally chosen for their poverty and were entitled to the payments for life. Today, new recipients are chosen each year on the recommendation of clergymen of various Christian denominations for their service to their churches or communities.During the service, which commemorates Jesus washing the feet of the Apostles at the Last Supper, the Queen traditionally distributes gifts according to the number of years she has lived. Because of the pandemic, last year\u0027s Maundy money was blessed at the Chapel Royal, St James\u0027s Palace, before being posted to recipients alongside a letter from the Queen.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: First stage of Kyiv\u0026#39s EU membership to begin \u0026#39within weeks\u0026#39, bloc chief saysRishi Sunak’s wife to pay UK tax on all incomePressure mounts on Rishi Sunak as he admits he held a US green card while ChancellorHow do you get a green card – and can you give one up?

That way they would benefit from a lower interest rate on their student loans.”An analysis of the student loans reforms by the Department for Education has already found that “those likely to see some negative impact with increased lifetime repayments under the reforms” include younger and female graduates as well as graduates “from disadvantaged backgrounds, or reside in the north, Midlands, south-west or Yorkshire and the Humber”.After analysing the reforms the IFS has now found that the student loan system will also become substantially less generous for middle-earning graduates from the 2012–22 starting cohorts. These students are substantially affected by changes in repayment thresholds but do not benefit from lower interest rates and stand to lose around £20,000 compared to the old system.A reduction of the earnings threshold for repayment of student loans from around £27,200 to £25,000 will also mean lower-paid graduates will begin to repay their loans sooner than they would have done under the old system. Ben Waltmann, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: “Student loans reform will reduce the cost of loans for the taxpayer and the highest earners, whereas borrowers with lower earnings will pay a lot more. How much more exactly is inevitably uncertain, but our best estimate is that lower-middling earners from the 2023 entry cohort onwards face the highest extra cost at around £30,000 over their lifetimes. The eventual impact of the reform is hugely uncertain, and will depend on economic developments and on government policy many decades into the future.  “Substantial uncertainty in the cost of student loans is to be expected. But the Government has needlessly added uncertainty by freezing student loan repayment thresholds in nominal terms at a time when inflation is high and unpredictable. This may mean that the reform will raise more money - or less - than the Government intended.”The National Union of Students has described the reforms as “directly hitting those from disadvantaged backgrounds”.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: First stage of Kyiv\u0026#39s EU membership to begin \u0026#39within weeks\u0026#39, bloc chief saysRishi Sunak’s wife to pay UK tax on all incomePressure mounts on Rishi Sunak as he admits he held a US green card while ChancellorHow do you get a green card – and can you give one up?

In Britain, it took until the mid-1970s for wide-ranging protections to be put in place to prevent discrimination on the grounds of sex and race. Disability discrimination legislation didn’t arrive for another 20 years after that, with the Gender Recognition Act following in 2004.The Equality Act 2010 brought together all the different protected groups, whose rights had been hard-won over the centuries, under a single piece of landmark legislation. As regulator of that Act, our mission at the Equality and Human Rights Commission is to uphold these protections.With nine different protected characteristics to consider, each with their own interests and needs, it is inevitable there will be occasions where some rights overlap. It is the EHRC’s role to balance those. One such example is the provision of single-sex spaces. The law is clear that organisations can sometimes limit access to their services to one sex, just as it’s clear that trans people have the right to live their lives free of discrimination in the gender they identify with.To judge by the often toxic tone of debate in the media or online, you would be led to believe the public are polarised on this topic. In reality, focus groups and opinion polls show there are more areas where we agree than disagree. The British people, with a characteristic sense of fair play, understand this is a complex issue and that each situation requires a balanced approach and careful consideration.At the same time, we recognise this is a sensitive area to navigate. with real impact on people’s lives. so the EHRC has this week published practical guidance to assist providers of single-sex services.This is not an intervention on the wider debate about sex and gender identity, but an effort to help organisations such as sports clubs, women’s refuges and rape crisis centres to understand exactly what the Equality Act says. It will also help employers and businesses, who want to know they are providing toilets and changing facilities for their staff and visitors appropriately.We do not make the law, but it is our regulatory function to uphold it, independent of government, campaign groups or vested interests.The Act confirms that, while you must not discriminate against someone due to their protected characteristics, there are exceptions which allow organisations to limit services to a certain group, provided the reasons are justified. The reasons could be for privacy, decency, to prevent trauma or to ensure health and safety.Equally, it can be perfectly legal and appropriate for organisations to open their services to all groups. Our guidance urges service providers to adopt flexible policies that balance the needs of all users, based on their specific circumstances. This is the best way to ensure that women, girls and trans people are all treated fairly. Occasionally competing rights need not mean conflict.Issues of sex and gender identity have dominated discussion since my appointment as EHRC chairwoman in December 2020. But there are still so many other areas where the scourge of discrimination persists and debates can be polarised. Last week, we launched a three-year strategy to tackle some of these, including discriminatory practices in the use of AI, fair access to education and healthcare post-Covid, and relationships between different communities.I am therefore urging people, whatever their sincerely held views, to lower the temperature of debate and work constructively with us to achieve a fairer society for all.Baroness Falkner is chair of the Equality and Human Rights CommissionMore from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: First stage of Kyiv\u0026#39s EU membership to begin \u0026#39within weeks\u0026#39, bloc chief saysRishi Sunak’s wife to pay UK tax on all incomePressure mounts on Rishi Sunak as he admits he held a US green card while ChancellorHow do you get a green card – and can you give one up?

But on his second day he snapped to lead counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett QC: By all means sir, feel free to ask me as many questions as you like. “But could I respectfully remind you that you did promise that we would be away this morning and I have changed my schedules to fit this in. I do have an extremely busy day meeting people. But this is more important than anything - but I would urge you to use your time wisely.  Lord Pickles later apologised for “any way I seemed discourteous”, adding: “As soon as I left the room I took the decision to cancel everything. “This is more important than anything I’m doing and I apologise… I fully understand that you’re doing a proper job.” But at the end of his evidence, he tripped up separately - appearing to mistake the death toll for that of Hillsborough, which until recently was . The toll from the  football ground disaster rose to  last year after a coroner’s ruling on the death of fan Andrew Devine. Lord Pickles referred to coroneraposs recommendations after the  Lakanal House fire in south London, which killed six people and injured  more. The first report from the Grenfell Inquiry found lessons from Lakanal fire had not been learned by the time of the Grenfell disaster eight years later.  He said: “It comes down to Michelleand to the nameless  people who were killed in the Grenfell fire. Itaposs them who we should think about when weaposre arguing the toss. Ultimately, as Iaposve said earlier, the dead deserve the dignity of being remembered by name and the dead deserve the dignity of a solution.”Lord Pickles was also chairman of the Conservative Party from  to .He made the mistake at the end of his evidence while answeringthere was anything he would have done dferently. After Lakanal, he said, “maybe I should have put in the letter the simple sentence aposand I accept the coroneraposs recommendationsapos - would that have changed things ”. But he added: “I donapost think it would have made any dference whatsoever.  There was a kind of mindset that existed in parts of the department that just simply ignored what was happening, made a view about what we were and came to it. Askedthe department should have “done more” to take on the lessons from Lakanal he replied: “Oh, definitely”. He added it was a personal failing on his part, “on the basis that I’m responsible for everything. The fact that I didn’t know about it, that no one briefed me… is no reasonable excuse, because ultimately it is always my fault.” But he also slammed firms that used flammable cladding, saying: “The conditions existed that there were people putting things in, into  and the like, that were combustible. “The idea to me is: how would anybody ever want to do that  How would they ever think it was a good idea ” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Eric PicklesConservative PartyPublic inquiryRed tapePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Labour leader Keir Starmer condemned her “breathtaking hypocrisy” for claiming non-dom status while living in Downing Street with a Chancellor husband who has hiked taxes for millions of ordinary people. While the Tories force people to choose between eating or heating, the millionaire Chancellor with four luxury homes parades his wealth on social media, posing in £ slider shoes before the last Budget and with a £ “smart mug” the year before. His brutal .% hike in National Insurance came into force this week. Our investigation found the Murty family’s vast Infosys business made tens of millions of pounds from British taxpayer-funded contracts, some since Mr Sunak became Chancellor in . Since , Infosys has earned £million working for the Care Quality Commission, the regulator of UK care homes. In , it won a £m contract with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, and this year secured a £m IT contract from the Tory-run East Sussex County Council. Infosys is among companies which shared £m in public sector contracts between  and . It was one of  suppliers in a £m deal with Transport for London in , at a time when Prime Minister Boris Johnson was Mayor of London.And it was one of nine partners in a £m contract with Tory-run Westminster City Council last year. Angela Rayner, Labour’s Deputy Leader, told the Mirror: “The British public deserve answers. The Government is already awash with Tory cronyism. Now it seems the Chancellor’s close family are personally benefiting from lucrative public contracts. Rishi Sunak must come clean about these business interests and any potential conflicts.”And Ed Miliband said the Chancellor should issue an “explanation” about his we’s tax status. Speaking to Sky News, the Shadow Secretary of State for Climate Change said: “He is the UK Chancellor asking people to pay more in taxes. “Is it right that his immediate family is sheltering from UK taxes  I think Rishi Sunak and his family should reflect on that. Non-dom status is legal but I think we should be clear that non-dom status is used to... pay less tax than you otherwise would.”  Christine Jardine, Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman, said: “Infosys benefiting from millions in UK Government contracts raises serious questions. It is wrong that profits making their way from these contracts into the Chancellor’s household don’t face their fair share of UK tax.” Ms Murty, who wed Mr Sunak in , is one of Britain’s richest women, her stake of almost % in Infosys worth a reported £m. Earnings from its UK public sector projects contributed to global Infosys revenues of £.bn last year, which earned profits of £.bn. It is estimated Ms Murty earns more than £m in idends from her stake, but she is not domiciled in the UK for tax purposes. On Wednesday, her spokeswoman said because she is an Indian citizen and India does not allow dual citizenship, then “according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes”.  The spokeswoman admitted yesterday that Ms Murty pays £, a year for her non-dom status. And Professor of Accounting Richard Murphy said: “She is only non-domiciled because she asked to be so.” There is no suggestion of wrongdoing. But, as a non-dom, Ms Murty does not need to pay tax on idends from overseas firms such as Infosys. It was founded by her dad Narayana Murty, has its HQ in India and is listed on the Indian and New York stock exchanges. If taxed on £m of Infosys idends in the UK, Ms Murty would pay more than £m, while in India she would pay as little as %, or £.m. Tax Justice UK executive director, Robert Palmer, said: “Ordinary people who face an increase to their national insurance contributions this week will be shocked to learn the Chancellor’s own we is a non-dom. This status could potentially save her substantial amounts of tax. The Government should end tax loopholes such as non-dom status and make sure those who have wealth pay their share.” Labour leader Mr Starmer said: “The Chancellor has imposed tax rise after tax rise on working people and he’s said time and again there’s no alternative, we’ve got no option. If it now transpires that his we has used schemes to reduce her own tax then that’s breathtaking hypocrisy and is more evidence of just how out of touch this Chancellor is.”The Prime Minister dodged questions about Ms Murty’s tax affairs. He said: “I think it is very important in politics,you possibly can, to try and keep people’s families out of it.” Last week, Mr Sunak objected to questions over Infosys’s business in Russia, while telling UK firms to “think very carefully” about making investments potentially beneficial to Putin regime.He said he found criticism of his we “very upsetting”. It has since emerged that Infosys is closing its Russian office.  Mr Sunak last month delivered a Spring Statement which failed to tackle the cost of living crisis. He and his family live in a flat above No, but they also own a £m mews property in Kensington, a flat in Old Brompton Road, a £m, -acre country pile in his Yorkshire constituency, and a lavish apartment in Santa Monica, Calornia. After the Chancellor was snapped filling up a car – not his, but a vehicle belonging to a supermarket worker – after the Spring Statement, Mr Sunak said he drove an old VW golf. He failed to mention he had use of at least three others, a Range Rover, a top-of-the-range Lexus, and a BMW. The Mirror has contacted the Treasury, Infosys and Ms Murty for comment.

General secretary Mark Serwotka said: This is devastating news for the , DWP staff who have not been offered permanent jobs. “These staff, who were recruited to deal with an unemployment crisis at the beginning of the pandemic, now face having to use the same Jobcentre services in June that they have successfully delivered over the last two years. “PCS members in Jobcentres have been reporting high levels of stress due to excessive workloads for months. “At a time of economic uncertainty, it is madness to throw them on the scrapheap when society is likely to need their support the most. A DWP spokesperson said: “The majority of people who joined us on fixed-term contacts during the pandemic will be staying with us permanently as we step up our efforts to maximise employment and help people to progress in work. “Our jobs market has recovered and unemployment is back to pre-pandemic levels but we want to go further and these changes will mean we have work coaches in the right places to continue delivering our multi-billion pound Plan for Jobs. “Our colleagues on fixed-term contracts have played an incredibly important role getting unemployment back down following the pandemic and we are supporting the minority we haven’t yet been able to offer a permanent role to find other suitable opportunities within DWP or where.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON JobcentresDepartment for Work and PensionsUnemployment\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Boris Johnson accepted today that the poorest households were having to choose between heating and eating. What he refused to accept was responsibility.It was his Government that cut Universal Credit, slashed benefits and raised taxes to their highest level since the Second World War. When so many are below the breadline, you would think any Government would do everything in its power to alleviate their plight. It is actually doing very little. Only the Tories could be resigned to so many people living in hardship and only the Tories could be so unwilling to do anything about it.  Virus failure Britain is now paying the price for the Government’s hasty decision to lt all Covid restrictions. Hospitals across England have declared critical emergencies because high infection rates have left them struggling to cope with an increase in admissions and staff shortages. The travel sector has also been affected, with airlines forced to cancel flights because so many crew members are off sick. Boris Johnson appears to be in denial about the situation.

Conservative minister Greg Hands was asked about the government’s plans to help provide greener fuels for people and he also outlined the steps that were being made to help people deal with the cost of living crisis.Mr Hands referred to a £ billion package that Chancellor Rishi Sunak revealed last February where a one-off repayable £ discount and a rebate on council tax bills would help tackle the £-a-year rise in average household’s energy bills in April. The Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth said the £ discount was not just a loan. He told the Question Time audience: The Chancellor of the Exchequer launched a really important package in February, just two months ago to deal with the rise in bills, not deal with it completely, but actually £ billion set aside, a £ discount on energy bills, a £ discount on council tax, additional funds to make sure the most vulnerable are able ... give them assistance in paying their energy.” At that point presenter Fiona Bruce jumped in saying: £ is, of course, a loan  And Mr Hands replied: It is not a loan, it is a discount, which you have to pay it back in the form of a levy. Ms Bruce persisted: But you have to pay it back, it sounds like a loan   The government minister continued: Not the inidual, it gets taken back at the point that it is levied. With laughs and shouts from the audience, Ms Bruce said to them: You are all shouting, what are you all shouting  They yelled back: It’s a loan. Mr Hands kept going: It’s taken back through a levy, it is not a loan because it does not create an obligation on the inidual to repay, it is actually a levy on the price point. He added: It is put on the price point, not on the inidual. The inidual does not have an obligation to repay. Askedpeople didnapost have to repaythey didnapost want he responded with members of the audience chuckling: No I’m not saying that.  At that point Labour MP Emily Thornberry said: Soyou don’t heat,you don’t have any heating afterwards then you don’t pay it back. It is not an obligation, said Mr Hands. These are the important things which have been announced to help people with bills. But that is dferent to the long term strategy that we have launched today with renewables, nuclear and making sure we are not increasing our imports of oil and gas. Boris Johnson has also had to defend the government over claims that the new energy strategy doesnapost help people with soaring bills.He said the strategy - which sets out aims to boost new nuclear power, offshore wind and hydrogen - is a long-term plan focusing on energy supply, undoing the mistakes of the past and taking the big decisions now. He said the Government was already doing a huge amount to help people with the immediate cost of living and of course we are going to do more. The latest investment will support research, development and deployment of cutting-edge technologies, the Government said, adding that it was also publishing a range of important documents and guidelines to support the development of these industries. A financial package, announced last Friday, includes £ million to fund low carbon hydrogen production projects, £ million towards the acceleration of Carbon Capture and StorageTechnologies, and a £. million competition for bidders to develop a UK Advanced Modular Reactor .

That is down by , since the , in the week ending  February . Rail services are battling Covid absences and a funding crisis - as there are still only % as many passengers travelling as pre-pandemic, the data shows. Passenger numbers have risen as fast as a million a week, hitting .million weekly journeys in the most recent figures. But this is down from .million weekly journeys pre-pandemic. And despite fares rising .% last month, services are still being cut to save cash. More cuts are planned in Yorkshire next month - leaving a two-hour, ten-minute gap between the .pm and .pm service from Leeds to Harrogate.  Labour, which obtained the leaked Rail Delivery Group data, blasted the figures just months after Tory ministers vowed to “protect and improve services” in the Integrated Rail Plan.Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “The Conservatives should come clean and admit they are taking the axe to vital rail services across the country. “This is the exact opposite of what the Conservatives promised, and will hit communities hard. “To add insult to injury, last month they clobbered passengers with another brutal fare hike.” The Rail Delivery Group said it was “only sensible” that services reflect the “new world” of passenger numbers that have “changed radically with the pandemic”, “so that the railway doesn’t take more than its fair share from the taxpayer”. Askedservices would ever get back to what they were in early , a spokesperson said: “Nothing is set in stone and we will continually monitor how passengersand look to step up services where there is enough demand from passengers.”  It comes days after local leaders said they were “shafted” by Boris Johnson’s bus funding which went to fewer than half of eligible areas.

Sienna Keera, , from Sydney, met her now-husband George Keywood after she became attracted to his character on British mockumentary People Just Do Nothing. After watching the comedy, about a pirate radio station called Kurupt FM, Sienna found she was attracted to the character Craig - who is played by George. Telling her story to Take  magazine, Sienna described him as a plus-sized man with beautul eyes.

But the trolls couldnapost be more wrong, as Sienna has revealed it was her who first approached George.As her attraction towards him grew while watching his show, she tracked him down on Instagram and decided to send him a message telling him she thought he was hilarious.To her surprise, George replied and the pair began chatting - and according to Sienna, it wasnapost long before the conversation became flirty. Sienna had been planning a trip to Europe with her friend at the time, but when her friend had to pull out of the holiday Sienna decided to visit London, Amsterdam and Paris on her own.  And she had her sights set on meeting George for the first time when she landed in the UK. Sending him a message the night before she was due to arrive in London, Sienna arranged to see George in the flesh and invited him over to her AirBnB. The next day as she tried to recover from her jetlag, Sienna recalls being fraught with nerves while waiting for George to arrive. But she says the minute she opened the door to him, she felt relaxed. The pair spent the next few days visiting the Tate Modern and having dinner while getting to know each other better. And after hitting it off immediately Sienna decided to invite George to join her for the remainder of her six-week tour of Europe.While the pair travelled around France and The Netherlands together, they began talking about how their relationship would fare long distance when Sienna ed to Australia. George was unsure about making the move down under as it would mean starting from scratch in his acting career. So after discussing it in depth, Sienna decided to uproot her le and move to London instead. When she ed to Australia, she immediately applied for a UK visa and broke the news to her parents that she was moving to London permanently. After they got over their initial shock and met George on Skype, Sienna says her mum and dad approved of their relationship. Shortly after making the move, Sienna and George took a trip to Venice, where he popped the question. Just a few months later, she fell pregnant with their first child. But still the pair have to put up with trolls saying Siennaaposs only in the relationship for the fame - and she admits George is better at dealing with it due to his background in showbiz. As time has passed Sienna has learnt how to block out the nasty comments and focuses on the many messages of support she receives. She said: Taking a chance on love like I did doesnapost always pay off – but Iaposm so grateful my leap of faith did.

The couple booked in for a second scan the following day which confirmed Heather was carrying a boy and the clinic began an investigation to find outthe embryo belonged to the couple at all. Heather and Robbie were then subject to a painful seven week wait while the investigation was underway - during which time Heather admitted she had no connection to the baby growing inside her, because she didnapost knowit was hers.

Heather said: We had a healthy baby, but I had no emotional connection and now I had to wrap my head around having a child forever that I wasn’t planning on.She added she hated the idea of not being able to connect with the baby inside her and described the pregnancy as a terrible experience.When he was born in December , she struggled to breastfeed him and began to suffer severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts - and was eventually diagnosed with complex postnatal depression. Heather stressed she didnapost want to sound ungrateful as now their -month-old son is full of magic.

While Heather is now recovering from postnatal depression, she says she feels immense guilt and shame over not being able to bond with him in the early months of his le. She said: “He’s an innocent being, he didn’t deserve any of this. The clinic messed with something so integral: our baby’s first formative years.

Faith Hindle, , was found hanged at her family home and was rushed to Royal Manchester Hospital, but medics were unable to save her from dying.An inquest at Bolton Coroneraposs Court was told her family, school and GP had helped her access mental health support in the months before her death.In August , two referrals were made to Salford Children and Adolescent Mental Health Serviceafter Faith attempted suicide, Manchester Evening News reported.Faith was seen by the Salford Mental Health Liaison Team on September  when she took an overdose at school. Tayaba Nicholson, a mental health practitioner at Salford CAMHS, picked up her referral and they regularly met over the coming months.  The hearing heard how during their telephone appointment on December  Faith told Ms Nicholson she was experiencing daily suicidal thoughts and felt “unable” to keep herself safe.

Rows of marquees have been set up, guard dogs are patrolling and I bet there’ll be all kinds of posh frocks and fancy food.Our Robert always liked David as the pair were both in Manchester United’s Class of . My late husband Colin enjoyed chatting to his mum and dad - they seem lovely people. For the Beckhams and Brooklyn’s we to be, money is no object so it’s probably normal for them to spend so much money on a wedding. But for me, vows are always the most important thing in a wedding. When you can really feel the couple’s love and pick up a sense of everyone in the room wishing them them a happy le, that’s what makes a cracking wedding - not the size of the ice sculpture or amount of champagne on tap. Weddings always take me back to me and Colin’s big day, when I wore a mini dress with a floppy hat because it was the days of Mary Quant style. Colin wore a brown suit and kipper tie which he insisted was green and I joked he was colourblind. The years would prove that he actually was, and I still have no idea how he was able to play snooker. We had our reception in a room above a pub across the road from my parents’ house. Everyone there knew us since we were knee high and, until the days my two sons were born, it was the happiest day of my le. Our first night as husband and we was spent in my aunt’s flat in Wrexham. But guests had sneaked in before us and as soon as we pulled the bedsheets back, we found long lines of apples all strung together. Attending a wedding feels like a little holiday, when you wear your Sunday best and have a night in a hotel. And there’s always one highlight I always look forward to: the food. I wish the photographs would hurry up so we could get the pate out. I learned over the years to keep a little packet of KP nuts in my handbag at weddings. When I ask everyone at the tablethey’d like some nuts from the bar they always refuse. But when I offer mine around but they never refuse. They’re only small bags so by the time it comes back to me there are about three nuts at the bottom. So here’s wishing Brooklyn Beckham all the best. And to the VIP guests: don’t forget your peanuts. Why Wrexham is greatest placeWrexham is on the shortlist to be named Britain’s city of culture .I can’t understand why. If judges visit now, they’ll find most of the shops boarded up and only pound or charity shops left. It used to be a pretty market town but it’s gone to pot. Yet it doesn’t matter that it might not look the most picturesque place. Becausethe judges care to scratch the surface of Wrexham and really get to know the people here, I’ve no doubt they’ll adore the place as much as I do. No one here can be doing with people who are all fur coat and no knickers. We don’t all come together in a snooty cafe to talk about books - we meet at the football ground each weekend. And everyone here looks out for each other. My friend Rob has called to cut my lawn ever since I lost Colin ten years ago, and this week he brought his we Sonia along so we could chat while he worked.  Not long after they’d gone, Rob rang my doorbell to deliver me a plated up dinner of liver and onions, which I’d mentioned was my favourite. He said: “Sonia noticed you were bad on your legs and have been eating ready meals because you can’t stand at the oven long.” Such kindness made me fill up. And I felt the same when a man rushed out of the GP surgery when they saw me struggle to get out of Janet’s car to offer his arm and say: “Can you manage, darling ” Wrexham is a place where everyone’s welcome, where kids’ bikes can be left unchained outside and everyone says hello and would have a good old chatyou have time. That’s the essence of Wrexham and its people. And that’s why, for me, it’s the best place on earth whether we win city of culture or not. Ender an era for soaps News of June Brown’s death really moved me. Even though I stopped watching EastEnders years ago, I loved Dot Cotton with her fag dangling out the side of her mouth. Brilliant actors like June made soap operas a hit because they created real characters. June and I share a le outlook: there’s no point worrying about tomorrow because we mightn’t be alive, so we might as well enjoy today.  Iaposll give Chris some stick On our Robert’s Radio  Live show, Chris Sutton loves winding him up. Chris assumed Scotland would qualy in World Cup games to play England, even though Wales has just as good a chance. The patriotic side of me came roaring out like a dragon. So I told Rob to tell Chris thathe makes fun of Wales again, I’ll have to shove my walking stick where the sun don’t shine. Will was silly...Iaposd have got to him backstage I am still stunned Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars. Demonstrating violence in front of a global audience was utterly wrong. If I’d been in the theatre and someone made a hurtful remark against a member of my family, I’d have waited until I was backstage and said: “Excuse me, what you said was not nice at all.” Then I’d have smacked him.  *******I might be the only person in the world who doesn’t have a smart-arse phone. And I’ve no intention of buying one. I have an old fashioned mobile which can text and make calls and that’s it.The clock still shows an hour behind and I wouldn’t bother altering it evenI knew how.

Sharlene Bockross, from Leicester, died suddenly just after Christmas, aged , leaving behind her -year-old son Tyler. The mum didnapost have much money or assets, but what little she did was passed down to the family. However, Sharlene has spent more than £ on a Jet summer holiday to the Greek island of Kos.Jet are reportedly demanding the family go through probate - appointing an executor of Sharleneaposs estate at a huge cost -they want the money back, LeicestershireLive reports.  The familyaposs solicitor has advised them that to get the £ back they will have to pay out about £ to go through probate. Thereaposs no set level for when a bereaved family needs to go through probate, but itaposs usually for larger estates involving multiple assets. For Sharleneaposs estate, this would be unnecessary. Sharleneaposs mum, Karen Gaze, said: She died suddenly and unexpectedly on December  from a cardiac arrest. Her brother, Paul, found her and tried to resuscitate her. We are all devastated. We later learned she had a heart condition she wasnapost aware of. She was supposed to be taking Tyler on holiday on June  to celebrate Tyleraposs th birthday. Sharlene was always a forward-thinker and she would pay a bit towards the holiday every month so that she could pay for it all in advance. She had paid about £ of the £, for the two of them. The trip to Kos was for Sharlene, Tyler, Sharleneaposs sister Sammi and Sammiaposs two daughters. Karen said there was nothing in the small print of the payment plan to suggest it would be so hard to get a refund upon Sharleneaposs death. She said: Jet are very sympathetic on the phone and very nice about it, but they are telling me I must have an executor for Shareleneaposs estate, which my solicitor says is just completely unnecessary and will cost about £. The money is for Tyler and we want him to have it but all heaposs going to get is £ once weaposve paid to appoint the executor. Itaposs so annoying because weaposve set up an account for the money Sharlene did have to go into and the banks have let us get the money. But this money is for Sharleneaposs poor son and Jet are digging their heels in. Iaposve sent the death certicate and even her birth certicate to prove that Iaposm her mum. But theyaposll only send the money to the executor of her estate. Itaposs been hard for Tyler - heaposs only  and heaposs got his GCSEs coming up. Heaposs being very strong but itaposs been hard, emotionally, for us all. I just donapost want to be arguing anymore. Explaining that lying would have been easier, she said: Ironically, I could have just phoned pretending to be Sharlene and asked to cancel and they would have given me a full refund. But I decided to be honest instead. Jet confirmed they were not going to make exceptions to the rules for Karen. They said in a statement: “We would like to extend our sincere condolences to Ms Gaze and her family at this dficult time. As the account used to make the original booking has been closed, we cannot refund that account. As such, we have requested for Ms Gaze to provide documentation showing her to be the named executor of her daughter’s estate so that we can refund her directly. As we have not received this proof of authority, we are unfortunately unable to do this. We sincerely hope to be able to complete the refund once this proof of authority is confirmed, and we have been in touch with Ms Gaze to explain this.” The Mirror contacted Jet for a statement.

The research indicates people are also less likely to be admitted to hospital with the current dominant iant and that symptoms do not last as long in those who have been vaccinated than with Delta .The findings support previous studies that suggest the incubation time and period of infectiousness for Omicron is shorter than for previous coronavirus iants.The two Covid- symptoms that were consistently more prevalent in both iants – regardless of vaccination status – were a sore throat and hoarse voice, the Daily Record reports.Researchers also found that some of the more debilitating symptoms, such as brain fog, eye burning, dizziness, fever and headaches were signicantly less prevalent in Omicron cases.Dr Cristina Menni from King’s College London said: “We observe a dferent clinical presentation of symptoms in those infected with Omicron compared to Delta. “As we are moving even further away from the average patient having UK government ‘core’ symptoms ie fever, persistent cough, loss of smell, our results point to a dferent selection of symptoms that may indicate infection.  “To protect others, it is still important to self-isolate for five days as soon as you see any symptoms.” Professor Ana Valdes, an honorary professor at King’s College London, said: “Although there is still a wide range of duration and severity of symptoms with Omicron, for vaccinated iniduals we find on average a shorter duration of symptoms. “This suggests that the incubation time and period of infectiousness for Omicron may also be shorter.” Researchers from King’s College London and scientists from Zoe studied the symptoms of , vaccinated UK participants from the Zoe Covid Study App who tested positive between June  last year and November  , when Delta was dominant, and December   to January  this year when Omicron was dominant. The study will be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology  Infectious Diseasesthis month in Lisbon.

Adam Long, , battled heavy substance abuse and mental health issues for a number of years which he was fighting with the support of his family and local services. In October  he made his way to the London Underground where he jumped in front of a train and was killed, City of London Coronersapos Court heard.In a statement read by coroner Linda Jacobs, Mum Samantha called her son a “wonderful, funny, caring person”, My London reported.She added how the family had a meal to celebrate a birthday on September  when Adam was “cheerful and gave “no indication this was the last time he would see his family”. In a phone call to his mum the next day, Adam ended it with Bye, love you. The statement continued: “There was no sense of this being last phone call. “On the day prior to his death, I visited his flat. There was leftovers in the fridge waiting to be eaten, clothes drying on the clothes horse, indicating he intended to . “The issues that Adam developed were around feelings of rejection. In September , we got him a place at a residential rehabilitation. Family and friends tried to show him it was a good thing but he decided not to go.

Internal emails show the head of a medal committee agreeing to follow “lines to take” from “our compensation colleagues” and accepting bogus information about nuclear test veterans.He wrongly linked medals to the issue of whether servicemen were injured - in clear breach of the rules - and went on to refuse gongs for five dferent groups of ex-servicemen. Now there are calls for the committee to be scrapped, and medals to be awarded to all those it has rejected since it was formed four years ago. Plymouth MP Johnny Mercer, who as Veterans Minister repeatedly told Parliament the committee was independent, said it was time for politicians to intervene.He said: “I think ministers should interrogate that committee, and perhaps try to understand why they’re not getting medals. I don’t think there’s evidence I was misled, but I do not think that decision about nuclear veterans was right.” The emails were uncovered after a six-month Freedom of Information battle about the Advisory Military Sub Committee which considers medal claims. It was set up, following a Mirror campaign in , to consider a gong for nuclear veterans. The emails show an unnamed civil servant telling committee chairman Charles Winstanley: “I thought you might be interested to see the lines to take that our compensation colleagues use in response to the nuclear test veterans’ claims.”  It is understood compensation colleagues refers to either government lawyers, or officials in Veterans UK, part of the MoD which administers war pensions. Neither are supposed to have any influence on medal decisions. The email makes  claims about Britain’s nuclear tests, including that no men were used in experiments, they were well-monitored, and there is no “evidence of excess illness or mortality”. The government’s own studies show the opposite is true. Within minutes, Winstanley replies calling this “succinct and relevant”, adding it “may be useful in any response to PQs [parliamentary questions].” He went on to refuse a medal, on the grounds there was insufficient “risk and rigour” to the nuclear tests. In February, the Mirror revealed how the committee was formed of Establishment figures who had been given medals for tasks including running Whitehall budgets, organising the Invictus Games, and reintegrating the Taliban into Afghan society.  Since the committee was formed, it has rejected calls for a medal for nuclear veterans three times. On the latest occasion, in December last year, Dr Winstanley told the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association that it did not even consider half of a -page appeal, because it contained no new information. He added - in a claim directly contradicted by his personal emails - that the issue of health was not linked to the award of medals, and there was no reason to justy any change to that position. Laura Jackson, , of Cheltenham, was born blind in one eye, had a heart attack at , suffered repeated miscarriages, lost her teeth, and had three malignant cancers removed from her face. Read more She only found out her father Ron Owen had taken part in nuclear tests after he and her brother both died young of a heart condition linked to radiation. “Saying these men were only at riskthere is proof they were exposed, is like saying soldiers are only at risk of being shotthey have a bullet wound,” she said. “This committee never spoke to a veteran, never asked one of the men whoaposd served whether they felt there was risk or rigour to it. It was just a front for the lawyers, and has been corrupted by the MoD. It should be scrapped and never allowed to meet again.” Labour MP Rebecca Long-Bailey, who campaigns on behalf of nuclear test veterans, said: “It is undeniable that radiation presents a risk, and regardless of injury, the veterans’ service was of vital importance to this country. “Officials have spent  years denying the truth to these men and their families, and will clearly carry on doing so until the Prime Minister takes charge of the situation, looks these veterans in the eye, and makes amends for this national scandal.” The committee also denied a medal to ground crew who took part in the  Berlin airlt, a star for Bomber Command, and clasps for the British Expeditionary Force sent to France in , and those who gathered intelligence behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. A spokesman for the MoD said: “We provide secretariat support to the chairman of the independent Advisory Military Sub Committee so he can effectively fulfil his duties, under the instruction of the Cabinet Office.

Two kind-hearted nine-year-olds had found her card and brought it to her small cul-de-sac home toit to her. Hania Zawadzka and Amelia Maciak had figured out where she lived and they pushed a note through her door and once in the hope of finding the card’s owner.  Once the smart kids had confirmed it was Safrina’s card, they handed it back to her. The next day, the grateful -year-old went to the girl’s house to meet their proud mums Wioleta and Katarzyna.To show her appreciation she gave them a thank you gt which included easter eggs and a cash reward.She said: I went to work on that day and had taken my credit card out along with some other items and started my support worker job. I left the house at .pm and stopped at Morrisons to get petrol and I couldn’t find my credit card. It was a weird moment where you think to yourself I’m pretty sure I took it out with me but I didn’t think much of it, maybe I forgot to take it as I had other items that I brought out as well. I started work around .pm and I got a notication from my door bell from the girls at .pm and that’s when I had realised I had lost it.  The girls were sceptical at first and asked me details on my card which I confirmed and they posted it through my letterbox and I had asked where they lived and stated they lived just across the road from me about  yards away. I told them I would come and see them today or tomorrow when I’m free and thanked them. I had finished my tea calls around pm and wasn’t due out for bed calls until .pm and that’s when I put together the gts and went to their house and presented the gts. The impressed business owner explained why the small act of kindness was so special. The parents especially are happy and proud, I’ve made new friends and taught the girls values and morals of their good deeds. It’s always what I try to do with other kids to teach them right and wrong as kids are our future, she said. She continued:They all gave me a big hug and smiled. I had met the father on the day of giving them gts on the same day but I hadn’t met the mothers yet until yesterday, they were all there and invited me in for a coffee.

Instead of going on a contactless spending spree they both chapped on every single door in my neighbourhood until they found me, not only that, they were both asking me card details to make sure I was the rightful owner.

Peter Rhodes, , says he doesnapost play the lottery very often and only buys tickets when the winnings are bigMr Rhodes says alarm bells started ringing when he took his ticket to a shop in London and he alleges his National Lottery jackpot was stolen by a shop employee when he tried to cash in the ticket.The pensioner claims a woman in Camelotaposs operations team confirmed it was worth £.million but hours later he says he was contacted by the lottery firmaposs fraud team saying they will not pay out the winnings - because it had already been claimed. Mr Rhodes, from London, told The Mirror: Itaposs a le-changing amount of money. They havenapost stolen from me. They stole my kidaposs futures. That money was going to be for them. I turned  a couple of weeks ago and I never asked anything from anyone. Mr Rhodes says he took his ticket to a shop in London in October  and when the shopkeeper put it through the machine it allegedly made a noise to indicate he had won something.  He said things then became very strange and claims the shopkeeper refused to give his ticket over. Mr Rhodes said: When I first went in and handed it over the shopkeeper put it in the machine and it made a noise, meaning it was a winning ticket of some sort. I didnapost know how much was on it and he then refused to give me my ticket. I asked for my ticket back and he took three steps to the right and put it under the counter. I leaned over and saw he had about  tickets under the counter. He picked one up and paid me something like £.. He tried to say it was my ticket and it wasnapost. I know it wasnapost because I folded mine twice and put it in my wallet and this one was flat.Mystery surrounds the winnings, with the shop where Mr Rhodes went to cash it in not making a claim. Mr Rhodes said: I spoke with someone in operations [at Camelot] who went out of their way to find an electronic footprint to prove I had bought the ticket. I donapost buy tickets every week, I only ever bought tickets when it was a large jackpot. I had the bank print off the statement and she found the ticket through that - and that is when I learned it was a £.million ticket. Then I got a call from their fraud department saying they are shutting down the case because they wonapost pay out twice. In search of his winnings, Mr Rhodes contacted the police. He has hired a solicitor and plans to take his case against National Lottery as far as he can. He said: I was so frustrated because it was the start of lockdown and I went to the police and they told me it is a civil matter. If National Lottery really cared about changing peopleaposs lives - then they need to sit up and listen. They would have more respectthey came out and help shut down shopkeepers who do this. A politan Police spokesperson said: In May  police received a report of fraud relating to a lottery ticket purchased in October . This was initially dealt with as a civil matter.

Only a Northerner knows what scraps are, andyou don’t know I’m not going to tell you. You’ll have to come up ‘ere and find out. And there’s a lot more to discover, but mainly the people.All the best comics come from the North. Think Ken Dodd, Les Dawson, Morecambe and Wise, Al Read, Hylda BakerVictoria Wood and Peter Kay.So are all the great inventors like George Stephenson who gave us railways, the top football teams and the best cricketers. It’s serious, too. As the great all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes said, “We doan’t play cricket in Yorkshire for foon”. If we have a chip on our shoulder – possibly both – it’s because southerners don’t appreciate us proper.  We don’t need to ask ourselves “are we northerners ” because we know already. But darn sarf they don’t know, and it’s about time somebody told ‘em. Writer Brian Groom seeks to do just that in Northerners: A History, a definitive new chronicle of the region, the first to appear this century. He starts with the question “Where is the North, and what is a Northerner ” And he ought to know, being a native of Stretford, Greater Manchester, who came back to live in Lancashire after decades of missionary work in London. In his view, the answer is simple: “The North is where people who live there think they are in the North”. And a Northerner is “someone who regards themself as a Northerner.” Really  So it’s not so much a place as a state of mind, an attitude even. And there’s more than enough of that around, say southerners - one of whom cracked the first “north of Watford” joke as long ago as .But being Northern must have started somewhere, sometime, among people. Groom traces our ancestors to a camp of ancient Britons near Scarborough in , BC. It later moved to Filey, but is now closed. The first great Northerner, Caramundia, Queen of the Brigantes, is not as famous as Boudicca, but she was better at doing deals for freedom with the Romans. In those days, England was ided into Britannia Inferior and Britannia Superior. Guess which was the North  Right first time, and nothing much has changed. There was a brief golden age under Bede and the monks of Lindisfarne, and then the Wars of the Roses devastated the North. This was a quarrel between rival branches of the Plantagenet family vying for the throne, not a battle between Lancashire and Yorkshire, argues historian Groom. Cricket fans may dispute his claim. The Industrial Revolution, born here around , confirmed the image of the North as a dirty, hard-working, direct, money-making place.  It was the engine of the nation’s growth, powered by pioneers like textile magnate Richard Arkwright, a barber and wig-maker from Preston, known as King Cotton, who created the factory system that dominated industry for a century. But behind the success story lay the misery of city slums, short, unhappy lives, a reliance on slave-trade cotton, the fruits of imperial expansion and armed trade – dubbed “war capitalism.” And the spectacular Victorian boom didn’t last. By , Britain had been overtaken by the USA. The revolution also gave impetus to the north-south ide. “Northerners saw themselves as independent, straight-talking, knowledgeable and practical,” writes Groom. “Southerners perceived northerners as truculent, lacking social graces, over-competitive and unsophisticated.” Recognise anybody here  It’s like looking in the mirror.Hang on - the great political forces of the age started here: the Independent Labour Party in Bradford and the Trades Union Congress. Northern women made an outstanding contribution. Social reformer Josephine Butler, the Bronte sisters, the militant suffragette movement led by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, and heroines like Grace Darling, -year-old rescuer of shipwrecked survivors in storm-tossed seas. The North created great cities: Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle where municipal socialism provided schools, housing, transport, water, gas and electricity. They were almost a state within a state. But they never achieved the political influence commensurate with their size, a situation that largely still holds true today. Northern -Mayors have the trappings of power, but little real clout, as Manchester’s Andy Burnham found during the pandemic. In the s, northern cities appeared to be “in terminal crisis” says Groom. There were riots in Liverpool, where unemployment soared to %, and Manchester. The North’s economy underperformed during the Cameron and May governments, and still does.Despite all the hot air about “levelling up”, the north-south chasm is still with us, like the poor. Will it ever vanish  “Can we ever be rid of the north-south ide, which casts the North as the back end of the English economy’s pantomime horse ” asks historian Groom. Thatcher claimed to have done so, asserting dogmatically after a trip to the region in : “The north-south ide has gone.” Only, perhaps, in the sense that she tried to abolish the industrial north. “Much as many would love to wish the North-South ide away, this is no time to give up,” says Groom. “If there is to be a revival, it will depend on the talents, energy and enterprise of northerners. “As for closing the cultural gap, does anyone really want to  Britain already has enough clone towns, surely,” he concludes.And enough clone accents, too. Northern students at Oxford were bullied for talking as they did at home, and northerners who migrated to “The Smoke” spent years trying to speak BBC English. That’s changed, but not totally. “Regional accents have become more accepted,” notes Groom, “though the south-east still dominates.” Reet there, son. Northerners was  years in the writing, and even longer in the evolution. Groom, former head of the regional reporting team of the Financial Times, travelled around the North in the fties with his father, the sales manager of a textile firm. He didn’t miss much. What kind of Northerner is he, I asked him. There was a brief, awkward silence, and then he replied “a pan-Northerner”. Translated, an all-and-everywhere Northerner, I suppose. Am I a Northener  My family originated in Bewcastle, on the Scottish borders , and came to Yorkshire at the turn of the th century by way of Allandale and Sunderland. Many more made the same kind of journey, from Ireland, Scotland, Wales and continental Europe, including Poles and Ukranians. Under the leaden skies that so often hang over us, we are all northerners now. Inevitably, it must be asked: Is there a comparable book about Southerners  No, and I think I know why. They don’t have, or seem to want, a similar sense of place and identity. And scraps, by the way, are scrunchy bits of batter left over from the fish frying process. Kids love ‘em, and they’re usually free, but your GP wouldn’t prescribe them. Facts and figuresManchester’s population grew from , in  to , in . In , more than half of England’s adult male industrial jobs were in Lancashire or West Yorkshire. In , the average le span for mechanics, labourers and their families was . Rugby League was created in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, in . In , Lancashire produced two-thirds of the world output of cotton cloth. By , it was only %. Strikes in Nelson, Lancs, gave it the name of “Litle Moscow”. The  Mines and Collieries Act banned girls, women and boys under ten from working underground.

Globalisation and the internet are weakening it, but I’d be astonishedit died out after all these centuries.Would you sooner have been a Southerner  No, the thought has never crossed my mind Are Northerners superior, or inferior, to Southerners  Neither. They are just people. I dislike sweeping generalisations. Both contain wildly ying iniduals, good and bad. Why is there no book about Southerners  Watch this space! Who’s your favourite Northerner, and why  Josephine Butler, the Victorian social reformer who established married women’s legal rights, criminalised child prostitution and human trafficking. If you’re a Northern lad, why leave  I moved to London to work on a national newspaper, but I never intended to stay forever. Is it good to be back in Lancashire  I’m in Saddleworth, in the historic West Riding of Yorkshire but now part of Oldham, Greater Manchester. It’s lovely to be back in the North. Our son and daughter are not far away. We have two grandsons – one Yorkshireman and one Lancastrian, so, even-handed.

The murders of Sarah Everard, Sabina Nessa and many others at the hands of men has provoked a national conversation about womenaposs safety.Sarah Everard was the first and most highly publicised murder in the capital in . She was killed by serving police officer Wayne Couzens on March  last year in a savage attack which involved kidnap, rape and murder. Couzens, from Deal in Kent, used his warrant card to abduct the defenceless -year-old as she walked home from a friendaposs house in Clapham, south London. The vile killer was handed a whole le sentence at the Old Bailey for the horric crime that sickened the nation.In May, Valentin Lazar, , followed Maria Rawlings off a bus in Romford, east London. The -year-old victim was strangled by evil Lazar, , and then subjected to a barbaric onslaught of extreme violence involving a wooden stick embedded with nails and a kne. The evil predator left Valentin in undergrowth in Little Heath in Romford and was later jailed for le with a minimum of  years and six months. Even though he was not charged with a sexual offence, the prosecution suggested a possible sexual motive because Valentin had bruises on her inner thighs and was found naked.  In September , primary school teacher Sabina Nessa was attacked and killed by Koci Selamaj. Like Sarah Everard, Sabina was preyed upon by Selamaj, who was unknown to her, as she walked near her south London home after dark. The evil sexual predator travelled from his home in Eastbourne, Sussex, to carry out the premeditated attack in the capital. Selamaj, , had a history of unreported violence against his estranged we, but had no previous convictions. He was today jailed for at least  years for her murder. In October, Josephine Smith, , was found dead in her home in east London after reports of a fire.Two male teenagers were charged with her manslaughter and arson and are expected to go on trial at the Old Bailey early next year. politan Police Detective Chief Inspector Neil John said such cases are incredibly rare but would not be drawn on the possible reasons behind the cluster of killings. Mr John declined to speculate on whether any of these attacks could have been copycat style murders in the wake of Sarah Everardaposs death. He also refused to comment on whether isolation during the Covid lockdown may have played a role in these incidents. He told PA: As to whether or not thereaposs any correlation between them, I simply donapost know Iaposm afraid.In April , the Met Police published an updated action plan to tackle violence against women and girls across London. In , at least  British women were killed by men, or in attacks where a man was the primary suspect, according to Counting Dead Women, a project dedicated to tracking such killings.According to the latest Office for National Statistics, between April  and March ,  women were murder in England, compared to  men - meaning % of people killed were women.Of these women,  were killed by a man and  by a female suspect. In  cases there was no known suspect. This means that - where the suspect was known - % of women were killed by men in the year ending March . The same number of women -  - were killed between April  to March , compared with  men. The most recent data from the ONS shows that % of the women killed in England or Wales knew their suspected killer, compared to % of male victims. Around a third of suspects were a current or former partner - with this being the most common relationship between victim and attacker where one exists.The Femicide Census project collects information about women who have been killed in the UK.Founders Karen Ingala Smith and Clarrie OaposCallaghan say the Government must go further: They said: We want the state to be accountable for preventing and prosecuting menaposs violence against women. We want perpetrators brought to justice but better still, we want the killing of women by men - femicide - to stop.

Firstly, make sure you thoroughly research the traits of the breed you’re looking to buy or adopt to ensure it’s an appropriate fit for you and your lestyle. For example, some dogs require a lot more physical exercise than others, some are more suited to rural living and some will require even more specialist care and training. Likewise, consider the age of the dog you’re looking to get – puppies require a lot of time, effort and training, soyou’re looking for something a little more ‘seasoned’ - then perhaps look at a rescue dog that’s a little older that’s already house trained.

The new iantaposs symptoms can include a runny nose, sneezing and sore throats - with the symptoms having changed since the original virus which contained coughs and fevers and a lost of smell or taste.The new iant, however, is similar to Omicron and most who have reported symptoms are believed to have cold-like symptoms.However, although little is known of Covid XE at this stage, many believe it does not come with any new symptoms. The new iant was identied in mid-January with more than  cases identied in the country so far. What are the new symptoms of Covid XE  Colds, coughs, running nose and a sore throat are most likely to be Covid XE symptoms.The new iant Covid XE is a mutation of the Omicron BA. and BA. strains - and is referred to as a recombinant. As Covid iants meet they multiply and evolve by sharing their genome or characteristics, therefore ending up with a recombinant. However, the virus is more likely to spread as it has reported to be % more transmissible than other strains. Meanwhile, the most recent data from UK public health officials finds that the new strain only accounts for % of cases in Britain. Thankfully, health bosses do not believe this iant is more severe than its predecessors with the vaccine holding up the barrier against the virus successfully. According to the World Health Organizationhas said early tests indicated XE is around % more transmissible - but the body has added the findings need more investigation.  The WHO report published last week said: Early-day estimates indicate a community growth rate advantage of % as compared to BA., however this finding requires further confirmation. “XE belongs to the Omicron iant until signicant dferences in transmission and disease characteristics, including severity, may be reported.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily health briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The sprinteraposs dad died aged  in , having married four dferent women, but only ever orcing one of them. He had not made a will, leading to a bitter fight between his fourth aposweapos Florence Ania, Olympian daughter Emma and her mum, Patricia Ania, over his east London home. Judge Nigel Gerald ruled retired nurse Florence was only in a marriage of convenience with Austin and found that Emma and her mum donapost have to hand her a single penny. But the court heard that Emma, who competed for Team GB in the  Olympics - has also been left with nothing because of the costs of fighting with her aposstepmum.apos  Emma Ania, now , was a successful athlete and was part of the British team which failed to complete the  x m relay final at the Beijing Olympics in  following a baton handover mishap. She missed out on London  due to injury, but has since gone on to forge a successful career as a personal trainer. She was one of nine children which her father had with his first two wives, Mary, who he later orced, and Emmaaposs mum Patricia. He married Patricia in  and separated in , but despite not going through a orce went on to marry a younger woman, Toyin, two years later. That marriage also failed, but again he failed to orce before marrying his fourth aposweapos, Florence, in , meaning Patricia was his last lawful we. Mr Ania had suffered with ill health for much of his adult le and died in , sparking a fight over his home in Leyton, east London.  Following a trial at Central London County Court last year, Judge Gerald threw out claims by both Florence and Patricia that they were entitled to the house, which was in Mr Aniaaposs name. Giving judgment, he said emotions have run particularly high between the warring parties, with Patricia and Emma taking a very strong dislike to Florence. The combined view of the defendants is that Florence is an imposter, essentially, who entered into a civil marriage of convenience with [Mr Austin] and has sought to take advantage of his frailty and advanced years to get money out of the estate, he said. Florence, on the other hand, regards herself very much as the wronged woman because it is her position that when she married the deceased she did so in good faith, not knowing that he was already married and therefore was entering into a bigamous marriage. Although they had married at Haringey Registry Office in , Mr Ania and Florence had never been a genuine couple, the judge found. Their marriage was simply a way for Nigerian-born Florence, who had had an asylum claim rejected, to get permission to stay in England.Florence, who had claimed to have sacriced  years of my le to care for Mr Ania, had told a straight lie, he said. They had not married in a tribal ceremony in Nigeria, but only in a civil ceremony in London to help her stay in the UK. At no time did Florence regard herself as having anything other than a fake marriage or marriage of convenience with the deceased, he found. Florence and the deceased connived to concoct the marriage of convenience purely and solely to enable Florence to remain in the United Kingdom because her asylum claim was bound to fail, because it was based on a tissue of lies. Not only did she willingly participate in the  civil marriage, knowing that it was not genuine, but there never had been any tribal marriage, so giving the lie to her claim that the civil marriage was a renewal of vows. However, because Mr Ania had provided a home for her in his final years, she had been dependent on him and so was entitled in principle to a payout from his estate under the  Inheritance Act, he added.  But the case went back to court this week after Florence claimed that the Leyton house had been deliberately sold below its true value in order to defeat her claim to a payout. Although an expert had valued the property at £,, Emma and Patricia as administrators of the estate had sold it for only £,, leaving nothing to fund a payout to Florence after estate debts were paid. For Patricia and Emma, barrister Stephen Boyd denied that the property had been deliberately sold at an undervalue to avoid having to give Florence a penny, pointing out that would harm them too as they were due to inherit most of the estate. Patricia was the main beneficiary under intestacy rules and had intended for the house to be her family home, but had to sell it because she could not get a mortgage to fund the £, needed to refurbish and extend it, he said. A deal had then been agreed with an Icelandic businessman to purchase the house for £,, reduced to £, only because they had been unable to get Florence to leave first so it could be sold empty. Giving judgment, Judge Gerald said the £, valuation was not reliable, given the appalling state of the property, its sitting squatter Florence and the fact that it was effectively a forced sale. He said mother and daughter had been placed in the position of having to sell due to unpaid debts owed by Florence from a previous court case relating to the validity of her marriage with Mr Austin. It seems to me very dficult to challenge the integrity of the decision which Patricia and Emma made to enter into this contract, he said at the end of a four-day trial this week. There is, in my judgment, nothing surprising or untoward in the acts, conduct and behaviour of Patricia and Emma, as administrators, or the third party purchaser. There is no evidence of any nature whatsoever of any untoward collusion. In many respects, Patricia and Emma were put in the position of a forced sale. The judge said Florence had made largely bogus claims during the case, including an off-the-cuff accusation that Emma, who lives in Belgium, and the Iceland-based purchaser are in a relationship, simply because she had been told Emma had a white boyfriend. He continued: Now that the property has been sold and the proceeds largely spent, from the estate accounts I have been provided with it is quite plain that the estate has negative assets. Her claim under the  Act must fail, because there was no money. It must follow that the claim must be dismissed. Ordering her to now leave the house so that the new owner can take possession, he said Florence is a squatter with no legal right to remain there. You have got  days before you have to get out of the house, Iaposm afraid, he told her. You will have to contact the local authority. Speaking afterwards, Emma Ania said she hoped the family could now put the six-year battle behind them.

Pugs, Boston terriers and British bulldogs are all bred for their aposcuteapos faces, but struggle to walk, breathe and sleep as a result.President Rosemary Elliott says dogs and cats of these breeds face lelong health conditions, reports Daily Mail.Breeding flat-faced dogs and cats is responsible for animal suffering that is entirely preventable and should be banned in animal welfare legislation, Dr Elliott told a parliamentary hearing in NSW on Thursday. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. These animals suffer gross physical deformities that make everyday le unbearably stressful. She believes there should be a change in legislation, so breeders are required to have certication issued by vets confirming the animals donapost have any health problems. Discussing whether these breeds have a right to live, Dr Elliott said: Their basic existence is one of suffering. We wouldnapost intentionally bring into the world, regardless of species, iniduals who are going to suffer to the extent that many of these animals suffer, she explained. Supporting Dr Elliottaposs viewpoint is Sydney vet, Sam Kovac, who believes gentle articial selection methods could see healthier breeds in a few generations time. I do support modying breed standards to make a healthier Frenchie that needs less vet visits, he said.  One French bulldog owner, Maureen Elvy, from Sydney, has spent over £, on le-saving surgeries for her pet, Phoebe. Phoebe is allergic to  types of trees and can only survive with a diet of crocodile meat and hypoallergenic biscuits. Had Maureen known her costs of living would be so high, she admits she probably wouldnapost have gotten Phoebe - but she has no regrets. What a moral dilemma, I love her so much and I canapost imagine my le without her, she said. But I wouldnapost knowingly get a sick dog.

But in a lawsuit against the giants, he claims a real Whopper is actually anything but.Legal papers claim that the burger is actually % smaller than portrayed in the companyaposs adverts.Coleman and countless others say they felt cheated when they discovered the actual size of their grub. Now he is demanding Burger King be held accountable for allegedly misleading the public.  The lawsuit, filed last week in the US District Court in Southern Florida, claims that Burger King is misrepresenting the size of its food in its ads. Customers are continually duped into buying a substandard product, it states. In addition to damages, the lawsuit also demands that Burger King “correct the deceptive behaviour.”Burger King advertisements portray the company’s burgers with “oversized meat patties and ingredients that overflow over the bun to make it appear that the burgers are approximately  per cent larger in size, and contain more than double the meat,” the lawsuit reads. “Burger King’s advertisements for its burger and menu items are unfair and financially damaging consumers as they are receiving food that is much lower in value than what was promised. A spokesperson for the restaurant said: “Burger King does not comment on pending or potential litigations.” It is not the only legal action the company has faced when it comes to the burgers.  A group of disgruntled vegan fast food fans filed a lawsuit after Burger King were found to be cooking their meatless Impossible Burgers on the same grill as their beef patties. The class-action lawsuit was filed by Phillip Williams, who says as a result of Burger King’s cooking methods, his supposedly meat-free meal was contaminated by meat by-products. According to the lawsuit: Burger King has no disclosures on its menu that would noty a consumer prior to the purchase of the Impossible Whopper that it was cooked in a manner that would result in meat by-products on the burger.

The surgeon said thatwe switch our focal vision to panoramic vision and engage our peripheral vision, it can reduce stress. He gave looking up at the sky as an example. In the comments section, many people agreed with his strategy and thanked him for sharing.

Whilst  jars have been identied so far, itaposs thought many more could be buried underground. Itaposs still unknown where they were made and which civilisation used them. Before Skopalaposs  excavation, the megalithicjars had been found on seven known sites, and Brits had discovered some near the Assam site in the s. When excavating the areas surrounding three of these sites, they discovered four more sites with partially exposed jars. Skopal told CNN : By going out, surveying and documenting them properly, the government and universities can manage their heritage a lot better and preserve these jars for future generations.But when the research team found the jars, the majority of their contents had disappeared. There are oral historical accounts of the Naga, local villagers, pulling beads and other items out of the jars - and some locals still have the beads as family heirlooms. In one of the villages weaposre staying in, one of the elderly ladies actually showed methat had been pulled out of the jar, he said. In Laos, similar types of jars have been excavated, with artefacts still contained inside such as beads and human remains. Skopal hopes his team will soon find some unopened jars at the new sites in Assam. He said: Some of the buried ones might have things still inside, but we havenapost excavated yet. To understand when the artefacts were buried, Skopalaposs team intends to use optically stimulated luminescence or OSL - a dating method which involves taking a sediment sample from directly underneath the jar, to determine when the light last hit it. The date would indicate when the the jars were buried, helping archaeologists to better understand exactly when the jars were created.

And while the workers themselves were happy to fund a new pair of shoes out of their own pockets to apologise for the mishap, the mum believes itaposs the nursery who should pay. In her post on Mumsnet, she explained: Our one-year-old came home from nursery with only one of her two very first shoes. The nursery was expecting Ofsted the next day so had had a huge clearout. They have subsequently searched high and low and emailed all the parents.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Theyaposre a lovely nursery, our baby is happy there and weaposre really lucky with our babyaposs key workers. They have both contacted us and offered to buy her a new pair together, which is really kind. However, we emailed the nursery, concerned that they appeared to be having to do so out of their own money, when we thought it was something that the nursery should pay, as a company, rather than what would be an houraposs wage for two of their employees. Especially as one is very junior and the other is pregnant. The mum has since received a reply from the nursery stating they would not pay for the shoes as it isnapost their policy - leaving the mum frustrated that she now has to buy a new pair herself. She added: Nursery have replied, telling us to clearly label our babyaposs clothes and that it isnapost their policy to pay for missing property, as it isnapost with other nurseries or schools.  I get that with schools when the children are responsible for their own things and I would never assume so with clothes, bags or coats etc, but shoes  I also donapost really see how labelling would have helped in this case. Iaposm just sad weaposve lost one of her very first shoes, sad that we might have to buy more unnecessarily given our financial situation, and frustrated that it doesnapost feel like the nursery is valuing their staff or responsibilities. The post sparked debate in the comment section, with other mums split on what they would do in a similar situation. Some said agreed that the nursery should replace the shoes that they lost, but others noted that young children are prone to losing or ruining shoes and clothes, so it shouldnapost come as a surprise that a shoe was misplaced in the first place. One person said: They lost the shoe and should replace it! While another added: The nursery should pay, not the staff.

The unique burger is intended to commemorate the Atlanta Bravesapos  World Series title and has caused a stir on social media, with many people sharing their thoughts.For the hefty price tag, the burger includes a lot of fancy ingredients, including a Wagyu beef patty, pan-fried eggs, foie gras, lobster tail, Tillamook cheddar cheese, truffle aioli and an heirloom tomato. It also comes with a side of parmesan waffle fries.There are two iants of the burger - the cheaper option costs £the price of which is in reference to the  years the Braves have existed.

The woman, named Chelsa, posted a video on TikTok in which she said her lips were once so full of filler that her top lip split in the middle - and she joked she had ended up looking like she had Richmond sausages for lips.Chelsaaposs clip included a picture of herself after her lips had split, and while itaposs unclear when the photo was taken, she explained in the comments that things had gotten out of hand over the course of a few years. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The woman captioned the video: Richmond sausage lips.And in text included in the clip, which was posted under the username @xxchelsaxx, she added: When my lips were so full of filler they split and looked like a bum hole.”Chelsa then offered more insight into her lip disaster in the comments of the video, when she admitted the split was the result of having ml of fillers injected, when most people only have around ml in their lips at a time. However, the woman also stated she got to that stage after slowly increasing the amount of filler she had injected each time, as she told one commenter: It was a gradual build-up over about   years. And while Chelsa can poke fun at her lips now that she limits her injections, itaposs important to understand the risks of going to the extremes with filler, such as migration, which occurs when parts of the body are overfilled. You should always keep track of the amount of filler that will be put into your lips, as it can be easy to get carried away and lose sight of how big your lips might be getting. If youaposve ever had filler before, you should always let your practitioner knowyou already have some filler in your lips before you have more injected - as this will help them assess how much they should be giving you.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TikTokViralUmm what Beauty trends\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" for the Real Beauty newsletter and join our community of real people who test products in the real world - all for free!Sign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It will be her first trip outside the US since the couple quit the royal familyMeghan Markle and Prince Harry at the Invictus Games in  Image: XByRussell MyersRoyal Editor:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsMeghan Markle will travel with Prince Harry to the Invictus Games in Holland next week, on her first trip outside of the US since the couple quit the royal family. The Mirror can reveal Harry and Meghan will be followed by a Netflix documentary crew throughout the Games, which start next Saturday.The couple’s decision to attend the event in The Hague has been blasted by palace insiders after Harry claimed it was “too dangerous” to travel to the UK.He is locked in a legal battle with the UK government over a decision to downgrade his security, and did not show up at a memorial service for his grandfather, Prince Philip, last week. Ken Wharfe, an ex-Met officer who once protected Harry, said: “I’m baffled about why Harry thinks he would be safer in the Netherlands than the UK. “He would have travelled to his grandfather’s memorial service with his brother or father and received protection from the Met. It’s not like he would have been turning up at Westminster Abbey on a bike. “It is more of a risk to go to Holland to support a charity with a military link than coming to London last week.” A spokesman for Harry and Meghan reportedly said: “We take measures based on the security threat level.”  Since ditching their royal roles to seek “financial independence”, Meghan, , and Harry, , have signed deals with Netflix and Spoty worth more than £million. The couple, who now live in Calornia with children Archie, two, and -month-old Lilibet, are expected to arrive in Holland on Friday. Harry’s father Prince Charles is understood to have offered an olive branch to smooth relations, offering the Duke of Sussex and his family the opportunity to stay with him and we Camilla at Highgrove. But sources close to Charles suggest the invitation “remains unanswered”.  Meghan may join Harry on stage at the Games opening ceremony, insiders promising “a big surprise to launch the event”. A source said: “Meghan is excited to travel with Harry for the event, which is certainly close to his heart.” The couple’s Archewell Productions last April announced its first major docu-series for Netflix would be titled Heart of Invictus, and follow athletes and organisers from across the world on the road to the Games.

When officials encountered the zoo in Armenia, they found dozens of other animals, including a lioness and monkeys, in a ramshackle dark barn.Itaposs thought the owner rescued animals from traffickers and hunters, yet one UK charity toldThe Sunthat conditions were shocking and among the worst we’ve seen.Now the Armenian government is being pressurised to shut down the park entirely.  One especially tragic situation saw a blind bear, called Nelson, housed in a dirty cage, with no exercise room for three decades, with rotting teeth and poor eyesight, which could be salvaged with surgery. Campaigners also revealed that a -year-old lioness called Sara, had been trapped in a space equivalent to a garden shed for seven years. Thereaposs also a group of monkeys, captive in a rotting barn with no daylight, and an eagle who is unable to stretch its wings in a small cage. An Armenian goat constantly charges the bars of its ramshackle pen. An animal welfare bill, which would see the zoo closed down, is currently being debated. The UK-based International Animal Rescuehas been trying to save Nelson the bear, but the owner Armen Tadevosyan, , refuses to hand him over.  He claims his animals are well looked after at the zoo in Armavir, which is a small town  miles west of Armenia’s capital, Yerevan. IAR president, Alan Knight OBE, said: The conditions these poor animals are living in are nothing short of hell on earth. The cages are small, filthy and dilapidated to say the least, and the animals have no choice but to stand in the squalor with nothing to break their boredom and frustration.  The idea that members of the public would choose to pay money to see these captive animals suffering behind bars is just laughable. We’ve been trying to rescue the bear, who we called Nelson, for months now with no success, but clearly all the animals in so-called Salvation Park are in urgent need of proper care and attention. As an animal welfare organisation, we are ready and willing to help ensure they get it. IAR has a bear rescue centre in Armenia and has so far saved  animals.  Alan Knight added: It’s a stain on the international reputation of Armenia that it allows sentient creatures to suffer such cruelty and neglect. I urge the government to step in right away and force the closure of the park so that the animals can be given proper food and care for the first time in years. There is no excuse for such cruelty and neglect and I know there will be a public outcry when people read about it.Hopefully public pressure will persuade the government to close the park and start the animals on the road to a better, happierle.That is the only humane and compassionate course of action.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

The goal settled the Royal Burgh side, and Lewis Montgomery added a brace on  and  minutes.In Mowi South Division , Kilmory ran out - winners against a young Oban Celtic second team at sun-drenched MacRae Park, Lochgilphead.Goals from Sandy Leiper on  minutes and three by Alex Cunninghamsealed the points for the Kilmory.The home side enjoyed a good first half and would be disappointed with aof just two goals. Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage. It did not take long for Craig Speirs to gave the islanders the lead on six minutes, rling home from the angle.Two minutes later Inveraray were level, Neil Campbell showing scoring from  yards.Bute again took the lead in the th minute when Aray failed to clear and Aiden McGregor took advantage.The home side settled into the game after that setback and started to play some decent shinty, though, despite creating numerous chances, the sides went into half time with the score - to Bute.Inveraray started the second half the better of the two sides, giving the youthful Bute side problems settling.With Inveraray pressing it took until the th minute for the equaliser to arrive Neil Campbell again driving the ball home.

All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked.

in Scotland coming here.The geese use the same wintering sites at Laggan, Tayinloan, Clachan, Glenbarr and Gigha each year.Farmers, naturally, are concerned to protect their crops but, when it comes to the Greenland geese, most understand the efforts to conserve a rare species.South Kintyre has one of the highest driving test pass rates in the UK, statistics from the Driving Standards Agency have revealed.In , almost three in every four people who took a test at the test centre in Campbeltown passed.And belying certain stereotypes, Campbeltown’s women were more successful than the men, with a five per cent higher pass rate.The statistics showed Campbeltown’s test centre carried out a total of  tests last year, of which  resulted in passes – . per cent.Campbeltown was ahead of Lochgilphead, which had a  per cent pass rate, and Oban, with  per cent.None were able to match Mull, with a pass rate of  per cent, the highest in the UK.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOArgyll and Bute’s sitting MP Ray Michie was at the centre of a political storm of protest last week when she was quoted as attacking the national anthem and Union Jack in the national press.Speaking to the Campbeltown Courier, Mrs Michie explained that her comments, contained within a -page document called ‘Towards a Federal United Kingdom’, launched by herself and Malcolm Bruce MP, referred to the Liberal Democrats’ policy on a Federal UK.‘I suggested that a strengthened and re-born UK, perhaps reinforced by a new symbolism which more accurately reflected the constituent countries might be considered,’ explained Mrs Michie.‘For example, Wales and Northern Ireland are not included in the Union Jack,’ she added.The document stated that, for many, the Union Jack had been ‘devalued’ in modern times by its ‘association with the Tory Party and the National Front’ and the national anthem had been similarly hijacked by the English rugby team.Commented Mrs Michie: ‘The media did not report that the anthem and flag belonged to the Queen and Country and that I was concerned that they were being taken over by some to represent only part of the United Kingdom, for example in sport and other instances of more sinister use.’FIFTY YEARS AGOFrom Budapest, then to Lochgilphead, to play whist and a visit to Mid Argyll was the week for Mr Michael Noble MP.Mr Noble had been in Budapest last week heading a trade delegation.He left Hungary on Friday afternoon and arrived home at Strone on Friday night.He came to the Argyll Hotel on Saturday evening where the local branch of the Unionist Party were holding a whist drive.During the tea break, Mr Noble gave a short talk on the ious problems facing the country both at home and overseas.At the end of the whist, Mr Noble won the third prize for gents.SEVENTY YEARS AGOAngus McVicar’s radio serial ‘Tiger Mountain’ broadcast a few weeks ago, was placed first in the recent voting for the most popular programme on Scottish Children’s Hour during the past year.His other serial, ‘Stubby sees it through,’ was third.In London and other regions, ‘Tiger Mountain’ was a close third only a few votes behind ‘Jennings at School’ and ‘The Bell Family’.As a result of this, Angus has the whole Children’s Hour to himself next Thursday, April  one episode is from both ‘Tiger Mountain’ and ‘Stubby’ and will be repeated in request week.We understand that a second programme in the series, ‘I’m proud of my father’, will be broadcast on Sunday May  when the subject will be Captain David Barkley MBE, who is in charge of the BEA ambulance flight at Renfrew.It will be remembered that this series got off to a fine start last January when May Newlands and her father both made an appearance at the microphone.Of this broadcast, the New Statesman and Nation said: ‘The Children’s Hour programme on the work of the Scottish leboat Coxswain Duncan Newlands, by his young daughter, was admirable.‘Vivid, unpretentious and charmingly told, it would surely have given pleasure to an adult audience.’"},{"url":null,"title":"leader april 1 2022","story":"Living in a coastal town, we must all be aware how dangerous and unforgiving the sea can

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve. He forgives you and remembers your sins no more."},{"url":null,"title":"west road overnight surfacing works rescheduled","story":"Due to operational reasons, the project will now begin on Sunday, April , for  nights.No works will take place on Fridays or Saturdays.

quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.There is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website here.The Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours."},{"url":null,"title":"galaxy-smarties-see-easter-eggs-least-sugar","story":"Expressdentist was intrigued to find out which Easter eggs could be the best and worst for your teeth, based on sugar content, so it investigated to see what the worst for sugar content is, so you don’t need to avoid all sweet treats this Easter.Coming in the joint top spot for the Easter eggs worst for your teeth are Galaxy Ripple and Galaxy Minstrels Easter Eggs with g of sugar per g.Although two Mars Galaxy products take the top spot, the other two Mars Galaxy productsrank respectively th and nd.: I tried Aldis new Easter egg range - but which ones are worth buying In second place is the Smarties Easter Egg with .g of sugar per g.

Anymore from the album Silver Eye, Ride A White Horse from Goldfrapp’s imperial phase and, inevitably, Strict Machine were all given a shuddering, galvanic oomph that seemed extra thrilling after the show’s more controlled beginnings.Suddenly the cool, even imperious, poses the band struck in the first half melted away and they started to look like they were having fun, with percussionist Seb Sternberg in particular grinning like the proverbial Cheshire Cat who had won a day trip to the dairy.In many ways, last night’s gig spoke to Goldfrapp’s inbuilt binaries, beginning with Alison Goldfrapp’s voice which effortlessly pivots between sultry basslines and the high-soaring notes she reaches forwhen words alone won’t suffice.Goldfrapp in the studio are a duo – Goldfrapp and Will Gregory – who lose Gregory but still grow legs in a live context. . Felt Mountain, which originally came out in , set the standard for the duo’s love of widescreen, cinematic atmospheres, but they quickly followed it up with the glam stomp of Black Cherry and, of course, Supernature.In the years since Goldfrapp have been toggling between these two default positions and it was notable that the achy, silvery drt of the first half of the evening, while Felt Mountain-heavy, could also accommodate tracks from Seventh Tree and Silver Eye which came out  years later .And, it should be noted, that some of us turn to Goldfrapp for just that sense of hushed pleasure. So, last night’s show was a reminder of how capable Goldfrapp the band is in matching the sometimes eerie, sometimes cosseting sonic environments Gregory and Goldfrapp conjure up in the studio, most notably when tapping into Felt Mountain’s Weimar-goes-trip hop feel on Utopia and Lovely Head.But sometimes you just want to dance. And last night allowed that too.In short, Goldfapp remain singular in their duality.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure.

An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649233437067.jpg--chinese_named_northern_ireland_s_most_popular_takeaway.jpg?1649233438000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220406newschinese named northern ireland s most popular takeaway","story":"The decision-making process of ordering a takeaway often ides opinion, with debates sparking almost every day as households fail to come to an agreement on which delicious treat they should indulge in.

We remain committed to working with the unions to avert this action. “We would welcome the opportunity to engage with unions to cover school duties, so that the wellbeing of schoolchildren can remain a priority. “All train services will continue to operate as normal. “We will communicate relevant passenger information through the media, on our website www.translink, through social media, in stations and on buses and trains. “Translink apologises for any inconvenience this may cause”."},{"url":null,"title":"ballycastle is northern irelands best place to live in 2022 proud locals are in full agreement as co antrim town edges out derry and","story":"Seafront: Ballycastle has been named Northern Ireland#s best place to live in the annual Sunday Times list.The mile-long beach at Ballycastle was described as beautulMarie Fox with baby EvaFinn DelaneyClaire Byrne FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSeafront: Ballycastle has been named Northern Ireland#s best place to live in the annual Sunday Times list.Allan PrestonTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFor the people of Ballycastle, it seems an obvious choice their home town has been picked as the best place to live in Northern Ireland.As they pass by its picturesque harbour, families and business owners in the Co Antrim town talk fondly of the epic coastal views on their doorstep.Rathlin Island is a short ferry trip away and Scotland is also visible on a clear day.Although a small seaside town, Ballycastle boasts a thriving Main Street with multiple cafes, greengrocers and fish and chip shops.Picked as part of the annual Sunday Times Best Places to Live, Ballycastle was chosen ahead of Londonderry and Helen’s Bay.Read MoreGarrett Hargan:OpinionDerry one of best places to live in Northern Ireland: A rich history, friendly people, and proud music and sporting traditions make city a fantastic place to liveDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read More‘There’s no place like home’: Derry Girls writer Lisa McGee reacts to city being named among top places to live in NIRead MoreBest places to live in the UK revealed They said of Ballycastle: “This unspoilt fishing village is a real coastal town rather than a tourist honeypot, with a strong independent streak and a welcoming atmosphere.“There’s a vibrant food scene, with everything from old-fashioned fish and chips at Morton’s by the harbour to tasty sourdough at Ursa Minor bakery.“The mile-long beach and beautul surroundings make it a blissful base for families.”With an average house price of £,, Ballycastle has experienced growth of % since .Enjoying time at the play park with two of her children, lelong resident Marie Foxagreed it was an ideal spot for families.“It’s definitely good for young ones.

People are very friendly and it is a lovely place to live, with the beautul environment we have with the Glens of Antrim.“Of course, you have the sea and Rathlin Island so close by.“It’s a fabulous place to live, but it’s very important that we keep it that way.“It’s not just going to always happen. You have to strive to make sure that ethos of community spirit and togetherness survives into the future.”Sinn Fein councillor Cara McShane said it was “fantastic news” for Ballycastle.“It’s a privilege to live and work here,” she said.“We are never complacent about this part of the world — there’s stunning views of Rathlin Island, Mull of Kintyre, Fair Head clf, which is nestled in the shadow of Knockglade Mountain.”She added a major selling point was a strong, independent retail offering, as well as a high number of producers in the local artisan food market.While frustrated at times that local government spending can be “Coleraine and Portrush-centric”, she is hopeful of plans currently out for consultation for a new greenway linking Ballymoney and Ballycastle.“That will offer people coming from places like Belfast the chance to get the train as far as Ballymoney, and of course you could then cycle, walk or run to Ballycastle,” she said.“That is exciting.

That means there is much for visitors to explore, from ancient to modern history.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s Bay‘There’s no place like home’: Derry Girls writer Lisa McGee reacts to city being named among top places to live in NIYou have the completely intact -year-old Derry Walls which is a real selling point for tourists.Other historic landmarks include the Guildhall — where it now stands was once the middle of the River Foyle where ships moored. It was mostly destroyed by fire in  and after extensive rebuilding was opened in .Because it is relatively small in size, Derry is an easy place to navigate for visitors.A key piece of infrastructure built in recent times was the Peace Bridge.Nowadays it is hard to imagine the city without it, and it’s an area of recreation popular with walkers and joggers.That area is arguably the best feature of the city, expanding the city centre, linking to Ebrington, St Columb’s Park and the renovated railway station.The Peace Bridge connects the Cityside and Waterside it was a masterstroke both in practical terms and as an act of symbolism by reconnecting the largely Catholic Cityside to the traditionally unionist Waterside. Derry is also a city of culture — made official in  — with musicians, poets, painters and actors famous the world over.Danny Boy is one of the most famous songs in the world, and has been covered by Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Eva Cassidy. Phil Coulter, The Undertones, Dana, Cara Dillon, Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol fame, Red Organ Serpent Sound, Fighting with Wire, SOAK and Wood Burning Savages show the range of musicians Derry has produced.It is also a city with proud sporting traditions in GAA and football and has produced Olympic medallists and world champions who first learned their trade on Derry’s pitches, roads and rivers.Nowhere does a festival like Derry, but there should be more added to the calendar.You have Glasgowbury in Draperstown, the City of Derry Jazz and Big Band Festival, the legendary Halloween festival and, in recent times, the Foyle Maritime Festival, which have all proven popular.When considering Derry, you also have to factor in the location. A short drive across the border and you’re in some of the world’s nicest beaches including Dunree and Tullagh Bay.To Derry’s advantage in the Sunday Times survey was an average house price of £,.“Reaping the rewards of years of investment and with a fine cultural reputation, this much-improved city stands out as somewhere cool, credible and cheap, with a bright future,” The Sunday Times states.But most people in the city would disagree with that statement, as multiple-deprivation measures, unemployment rates and analysis of investment show the second city has not received a great deal of inward investment.For example, since Invest NI was formed in  until   it has assisted , new jobs in Belfast whereas Foyle got , and East Londonderry ,.In that time it invested £.bn in Belfast and £.bn between Foyle and East Londonderry.Most ReadBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s BayMan trafficked to Northern Ireland as slave, injected with heroin and forced to sell it on streetsStormont department apologises and drops its legal challenge over whistleblowerDerry Girls premiere: Watch as cast and crew in city for special screening of third seriesLurgan mum diagnosed with cancer in AE told she only had ‘hours to live’Top VideosPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner Dornan\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRhys McClenaghan becomes new Guinness World Record holderPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderLatest Northern IrelandJeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister criticise Doug Beattie for not supporting anti-Protocol ralliesI will never forgive murderer for what he did to Jenner, says grieving mumSDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaPO ferry released from detention after being reinspected by maritime officialsNorthern Ireland weather: Frosty Friday night ahead and scattered Saturday showers expectedLatestJeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister criticise Doug Beattie for not supporting anti-Protocol ralliesI will never forgive murderer for what he did to Jenner, says grieving mumSDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaSophie Ingle effort not enough as Wales beaten by France in World Cup qualierRecall of Kinder products widened amid concerns about salmonella,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture: Google Maps FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelfast#s Shaftesbury Square. Picture: Google MapsMichael Kenwood, Local Democracy reporterApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailBelfast council has vowed to work on a “tactical regeneration” plan for the rundown Shaftesbury Square area in the city centre.The area used to be the crowning glory of Belfast’s so-called “golden mile” – which stretched from Lisburn Road along the fullof Great Victoria Street – but in recent decades has seen steady decline and is noted for its empty premises and dilapidated facades.This week during a meeting of the City Growth and Regeneration Committee at Belfast City Council, elected representatives agreed a proposal from council officers to create a plan for the area to be shared with the relevant Stormont departments, businesses and other stakeholders. The “tactical regeneration” scheme will also look at enhancement of the Castle Street area.It involves quick short term and low cost actions such as transforming dingy former shopfronts, opening up public realm space by taking away street clutter such as bollards, opening up fenced off areas, introducing artworks, parklets and greening.A committee report states: “Whilst certain businesses have sustained a presence in the area and continue to make a positive contribution in terms of well-maintained active frontages, there are a number of vacancies and the wider area is in need of signicant intervention.“It should be noted that there are several development proposals progressing through the planning process in the wider area, and major public sector placemaking and infrastructure projects like Belfast Streets Ahead  and BRT  also have the potential to have a transformative impact.“However, the timescales associated with emerging or committed public and private projects in this area are y, and in some cases uncertain, and there is a growing consensus among local stakeholders that there is a need for shorter term action.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It adds: “Officers are proposing that a tactical regeneration scheme is worked up for part of this area initially. Whilst the detail needs to be developed, it could include a combination of minor works to building frontages, while also taking advantage of generous footway widths along Great Victoria Street through measures such as removal of street clutter and introduction of soft landscaping and greening opportunities, where possible.“It is proposed that a scheme be developed that focuses on Great Victoria Street, east and west sides, from Bruce St to Donegall Rd, as a priority given the condition of this area.”The council says that the Stormont Department for Communities has indicated that funding may be available in the   financial period,projects can be developed up to a “business case” status.Further funding may come from the South West Quarter Stakeholders Group, a group comprising a mix of private sector business council officers, Translink, NIHE and two Stormont departments.DUP Botanic Councillor Tracy Kelly said: “If you look at Great Victoria Street and the mouth of the city centre, it’s absolutely horrendous. It needs a massive piece of work and investment. So I am so glad to see some thought going into it.“There are a few shops going on to the Donegall Road, just off Shaftesbury Square that recently got funding from the council to give them a bit of a le with shop front work and a bit of paint, and that has made a massive dference already.”She added: “When you think of the golden mile, and what it used to be – it is quite frightening now at night time around there.”Green Councillor Mal O’Hara said: “Parts of the inner fringe around the city core have been ruined by the car dependency of this city and the need to ensure we have traffic flow. Sandy Row, a once vibrant and bustling shopping district, has been ruined to become a cut-through for traffic flow.” He asked for space to be taken away from private cars as part of the regeneration projects.In , a £ million Belfast Transport Hub was approved by the council, involving the creation of a new bus and train centre on the other side of Durham Street to the current Great Victoria Street bus and train stations Those stations will be replaced with a mall.The wider Weaver’s Cross plan involves the regeneration of land to the immediate south of the current train and bus centre, land currently used as parking space on either side of Hope Street and Bruce Street, cutting through Great Victoria Street.

I ended up going down the political route, so it’s kind of nice that when it comes to election times, I can exercise that other side of things.“I have an A-level in art and that’s it. It’s all self-taught. My husband is a computer games artist, so I take a lot of advice from him, but a lot of it is Googling how to do things and, I think, having a bit of an eye for design anyway. None of it is perfect, I’m sure someone who is qualied and experienced in this field would be able to pull up something quicker and a lot more eye-catching, but I’m pleased with the way it turns out.”The Coleraine woman said she spent a few days last week “going round the constituency getting some photographs just to get nice fresh images for the literature”, but overall she’s kept to the same colour scheme and theme for her election content since she first stood in .“It can take a while, but sitting down I can get into a bit of a zone with it. You can find me maybe starting it at pm and still sitting until am in the morning because I’m on a bit of a roll with it. There’s other days when I get a bit of a block and that’s usually the days where you’re under pressure and trying to make deadlines for printers.”She joked: “If the election doesn’t go my way, maybe I have another career!”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Related topicsClaire SugdenMore On Claire Sugden PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseUkraine crisis: Stormont urged to ‘step up’ and pressure Home Office into waiving visa requirement for refugeesSugden’s anger as Stormont crisis endangers mental health court planStaffing crisis in agri-food industry is down to immigration rules, Poots toldIndependent unionist Claire Sugden ‘less likely’ to join UUP following Doug Beattie tweet stormMost ReadBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s BayMan trafficked to Northern Ireland as slave, injected with heroin and forced to sell it on streetsStormont department apologises and drops its legal challenge over whistleblowerDerry Girls premiere: Watch as cast and crew in city for special screening of third seriesLurgan mum diagnosed with cancer in AE told she only had ‘hours to live’Top VideosPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner Dornan\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRhys McClenaghan becomes new Guinness World Record holderPlayBallymoney road closed due to large ongoing fireLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaNorthern Ireland Assembly elections candidates in full: Who is standing in your area UUP Peer Empey claims ‘credible rumours’ emerging in Westminster Article  will be triggered after Stormont electionNorthern Ireland Assembly election : People ‘have a choice’ to attend polling stationCovid positive, Electoral Office confirmsDUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyLatestSDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaPO ferry released from detention after being reinspected by maritime officialsNorthern Ireland weather: Frosty Friday night ahead and scattered Saturday showers expectedLarge crowds gather in Lurgan for anti-Northern Ireland Protocol rally, with organisers expecting , attendeesCharl Schwartzel inspired by past Masters win as Tiger Woods fights to make cut,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Graham Baalham-CurryApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailYou can’t drink your morning coffee without an audience and as you walk down the road you are watched from all angles, both geometrically and politically.That’s right — election season is upon us and as a result, the faces of your local politicians on poster after poster are becoming more familiar than the heartthrobs we had on our walls as teenagers.It is one staple of election campaigns that has been around for decades,not centuries, and while there’s some sport initially in comparing the tenets of graphic design, colour schemes and haircutsof our political representatives, when you sit and think about it, is this something that’s really needed in this day and age As a journalist, I’m probablymore familiar with Northern Ireland’s politicians than the average person, given my job involves thinking, talking and writing about them on a daily basis. As such, I don’t often need a reminder of who there is to vote for in my constituency or what parties they stand for. I’ll admit that an election poster is certainly an easy way to raise awareness of, on a basic level, exactly who represents or wants to represent you.But after seeing the same person staring at me five times before I had crossed a single bridge in Coleraine where I live the other day, I started to wonder do posters influence how people vote — or are posters just a habit, one which may not serve the most purpose but indicates you have a dog in the fight Read MoreIndependent candidate Claire Sugden using her artistic flair for election materialThe ironic thing is that maybe posters mean much more to the smaller parties and independents with comparably smaller budgets to the more prominent frontrunners. For them, it’s more of a stretch to measure up the level of postering and the legwork it takes displayed by other parties but who worry they won’t get as much attentionthey don’t appear to have parity in terms of faces on streets.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Often described as CorriBoard posters, many of those massive signs you see on our streets and roads are made from one of the dirtiest words of our time — plastic. While the materials can sometimes be upcycled, it is suggested they will take hundreds of years to degrade, long after the politicians whose faces on which they featured and possibly even the parties they represented have departed this fine earth.It’s true that they do have benefits. They are immune to hackers which have plagued recent international elections . Not everyone has top class internet access so it does keep demographics informed. There’s no question that they send a message to voters and a reminder that an election is taking place — andyour local MLA hasn’t fixed that pothole on your road, you will know just the face to ask when they come a-canvassing.Green Party NI politician Mal O’Hara has joined some of his international colleagues in favouring a system seen in Europe where paper posters are erected in certain spaces only, instead of being festooned on every available surface. But this approach isn’t favoured by some larger parties who are able to spread their resources more widely and want to be able to show that. And so, without any wider consensus, the great poster parade marches on even in  when the word on all of our lips is the environment and many of us are kept awake at night wondering what sort of a world it is we’re leaving behind for the next generation and the one after that.What is the alternative  Some may argue it’s already here, and it’s called social media, where most views are shared and heard and your popularity isn’t always just down to what party backs you, but how well you use your voice. There’s also mainstream media via the television, news sites and newspapers as well as the radio. And for those who have access to neither, there’s canvassing — and feel free to reject those shiny leaflets which usually take a short trip to the bin in favour of a chat instead.Or why not make use of the screens in Belfast city centre or in shopping centres to instead display candidates posters on a revolving basis, on the proviso that these screens and devices would have to be made more widely available in our towns and villages Some may disregard these suggestions but surely there must be another way, instead of risking damage to the environment and obscuring our beautul landscape on this island with these massive posters cropping up at regular intervals.Whatever your thoughts on posters, the discourse around them doesn’t end after the election unfortunately. And while you might find the face of a local politician peaking out from behind a hedge or unlucky enough to be placed atop a bonfire, you will also be treated to the crowdsourcing operation that is your local politician asking you to make them aware of any forlorn final poster still lingering on our streets. Or at the very least, a photo of them with clippers in hand, telling all they are out and about removing their posters, sent to the rubbish heap, after election season comes to an end.Related topicsGreen PartyMore On Green PartyClimate Change Bill was ‘not everything’ Green Party leader Clare Bailey hoped for PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behind PremiumFionola MeredithOpinionWhy there’s no such thing as giving kids a ‘loving smack’Most ReadBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s BayMan trafficked to Northern Ireland as slave, injected with heroin and forced to sell it on streetsStormont department apologises and drops its legal challenge over whistleblowerDerry Girls premiere: Watch as cast and crew in city for special screening of third seriesLurgan mum diagnosed with cancer in AE told she only had ‘hours to live’Top VideosPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner Dornan\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRhys McClenaghan becomes new Guinness World Record holderPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaNorthern Ireland Assembly elections candidates in full: Who is standing in your area UUP Peer Empey claims ‘credible rumours’ emerging in Westminster Article  will be triggered after Stormont electionNorthern Ireland Assembly election : People ‘have a choice’ to attend polling stationCovid positive, Electoral Office confirmsDUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyLatestJeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister criticise Doug Beattie for not supporting anti-Protocol ralliesI will never forgive murderer for what he did to Jenner, says grieving mumSDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaSophie Ingle effort not enough as Wales beaten by France in World Cup qualierRecall of Kinder products widened amid concerns about salmonella,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If someone has been shielding or there are mental health issue or other vulnerabilities, it would be reasonable at this point to say ‘I couldn’t expose myself to risk’,” she added.Government has directed that in Northern Ireland the normal absent vote legislation should apply, so there has been no change in Northern Ireland to make allowance for Covid and that means April  is such an important deadline for anyone who has been shielding or who is frail or vulnerable.”The Department of Health has been approached for comment.Most ReadBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s BayMan trafficked to Northern Ireland as slave, injected with heroin and forced to sell it on streetsStormont department apologises and drops its legal challenge over whistleblowerDerry Girls premiere: Watch as cast and crew in city for special screening of third seriesLurgan mum diagnosed with cancer in AE told she only had ‘hours to live’Top VideosPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner Dornan\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRhys McClenaghan becomes new Guinness World Record holderPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaNorthern Ireland Assembly elections candidates in full: Who is standing in your area UUP Peer Empey claims ‘credible rumours’ emerging in Westminster Article  will be triggered after Stormont electionDUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyArlene Foster says ‘all to play for’ in Assembly election even with Sinn Fein ahead in ‘most of the polls’LatestJeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister criticise Doug Beattie for not supporting anti-Protocol ralliesI will never forgive murderer for what he did to Jenner, says grieving mumSDLP’s Cara Hunter latest politician to have election posters stolen from constituency areaSophie Ingle effort not enough as Wales beaten by France in World Cup qualierRecall of Kinder products widened amid concerns about salmonella,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine. I wish them every success with their proposal to develop a walking route, which will bring much pleasure to local and international visitors. .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down High star in event  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Day is always a special occasion in the sporting calendar and this year thankfully events at The Meadows Equestrian Centre were back to normal.The annual inter-school showjumping competition attracted teams from across the province, and the open class, which was a qualier for Balmoral Show was particularly competitive.In the novice class, Sarah Carse, Emily Carse, Ellen MacNabb and Sophie Herron were narrowly beaten into second place.In the open class, Down High had been drawn th in the competition, and just before they entered the arena, only one other school had finished the course on a zero score.The spectator grandstand was full, the weather was close to perfect and the fences were set to be executed with precision.It had proved reasonably tricky so far and understandably the four riders from Down High were more nervous than usual.However, after a breath-taking effort the Down High Flyers managed to finish on a zero score and the clock showed that they had also beaten the time of all the other teams.The presentation of awards quickly followed.Abby Cummiskey, Annie Gibson, Megan Nelson and Zara Sharvin entered the arena once again to receive their rosettes and coveted ticket to Balmoral Show.It was a proud day for their chef drsquoequipe Ruth Adams, their parents and indeed for Down High School.They are now looking forward to a great day out at the Bluegrass Open Championship at Balmoral Showgrounds on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down U","story":"DOWN came into this game on the back of a strong finish to their league campaign to secure second spot in Ulster and earn a Platinum final against a highly fancied Armagh team.During the league when these two teams matched up, just three weeks ago, it took until after half-time before Down registered their first score. However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway which will be cut down through the steep shore bank and will involve reinforced piling.Once completed the station will be ready to take delivery of the new leboat, which will be named the Bryant and Eleanor Girling after a generous RNLI benefactor.SAINTFIELD mdash Three workmen and two police officers required hospital treatment after a chemical spill in Saintfield last week.Four  gallon drums containing a mixture of acid and caustic soda, fell from a lorry on the Old Grand Jury Road at around am on Friday morning, initiating a full-scale emergency response from the Fire Brigade.Appliances from Ballynahinch and Downpatrick were sent to the scene and a specialist equipment carrying emergency tender unit was also despatched from Belfast.The incident occurred as the articulated lorry was leaving a yard on the Old Grand Jury Road carrying a large number of the chemical-containing drums.The four drums fell from the lorry, with two spilling several hundred gallons of the corrosive mixture onto the road.The lorry driver and his two assistants quickly righted the drums but suffered from fume inhalation, as did two police officers who arrived on the scene minutes after the spill.All five were treated at the Downe Hospital but were later released.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Environmentrsquos proposals for the management of Strangford Lough have been welcomed as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside community have been looking for.ldquoThe new body represents a wide spectrum of community support, including the pockets of power which were driven largely by their own self-interests, he said.MOURNES mdash Health officials have been accused of ldquoplucking figures from nowhere to justy closure plans for Newcastlersquos Mourne House.The Eastern Health Council heard this week that a renovation figure of pound, for the residential home has been produced without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report.The claims were made by a deputation from the Friends of Mourne House which addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide a first response to cardiac emergencies pending the arrival of an ambulance.The presentation was made on Monday to Portaferry GPs Dr Desmond Compton and Dr David Peacock by Mr Peter Welsh, the Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health Boardrsquos chief ambulance officer, Mr Alan Murray.The Ambulance Service has funded the inclusion of sophisticated diagnostic facilities on the defibrillator, as well as communication systems for the doctors to ensure their immediate availability.BALLYNAHINCH mdash One of Down Districtrsquos biggest charity events of the year will take place in Ballynahinch next month.The Ballynahinch Lions k and fun runs will be staged on Saturday, May , and once again look likely to raise several thousand pounds for charity.In its third year the event has already raised pound, and the organisers are hoping that next monthrsquos event will top the pound total which was raised last year.This yearrsquos beneficiaries will be the Leukaemia Research Fund, the Marie Curie Trust, Beaconsfield, and Lions charities.The event, which is over a proven course and backed by the Northern Ireland Amateur Athletics Federation, has already become established as one of the major events on the athletics calendar and will attract runners from many parts of the province.Once again the run will begin at .pm at the Community Centre in Windmill Street, and part of the route will be through the grounds of the Montalto Estate.Lots of dferent categories have been designated by the Lions and there are prizes on offer for practically everything, from the first k runner home to the best fancy dress team.A new aspect of the event this year will be the Tracy Barr Memorial Trophy which school teams will be competing for over the K fun run

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility. In that context, I do not consider there to be any need for this proposal.A spokesperson for Arc said there was still a ldquoclear need to develop a ldquonew, modern waste infrastructure for the region.It said the proposed facility would boost recycling, reduce emissions and provide green electricity.ldquoIt is essential that Arc has an opportunity to review the planning reasons behind the ministerrsquos statement and we will carefully consider todayrsquos announcement in that light over the next few days, added the spokesperson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Museum to shut doors over Easter  ","story":"THE Down County Museum in Downpatrick will be closed over Easter.The announcement came just hours after Newry, Mourne and Down Council refused to confirmthe museum would be open to the public over the busy Easter holiday period.Initially, the local authority would only confirm that a decision on the Easter opening would be made in ldquodue course, but within hours of informing the Recorder of this and the paper being printed, it was finally revealed that the museum would remain closed.The council has subsequently confirmed that a reduced staff team is delivering services at the museum mdash which only opens between am and pm from Wednesday and Friday mdash and it is ldquowith regret that it will not be open at Easter.The Recorder understands that are six vacant staff positions at the museum and that up to five staff members are currently off sick.Adverts to recruit new museum staff have been published this week with the local authority looking to appoint and assistant curator, education and outreach officer, museum assistant and a cultural assistant.While council officials are hoping to have new employees in place next month, the local authority has not made clear how many new staff are being recruited and what the Downpatrick museumrsquos future opening hours will be.The museum has been at the centre of a controversial staff restructuring process.Downpatrick SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said thee council should have made it clear last week that the museum would be closed at Easter.Welcoming plans to recruit new employees, he suggested that councillors should be briefed at a one-off council meeting by senior local authority officials on exactly what is happening at the museum.ldquoI remain disappointed that the museum will not be open at Easter. While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,. A good job well done.With the racing season in full flow, EDAC club members were quick to get signed up on the recent membership night so that they can keep training and also avail of the club discount when entering races.They might also have been encouraged by the raffle which was held at the sign-up.

These cars were very reliable, always came with a full service history and low mileage. Many an auction night was filled with many young buyers rubbing shoulders with car traders trying to grab themselves a good deal.The DLVA has now prevented these private buyers taking part in these auctions and have stipulated that these DLA car auctions are now trade only. This in turn is pushing these private buyers instead onto the garage or traders forecourt where the same car they could have bought at auction is now two or three thousand pounds higher because of the traders premium. The traders are also seeing more demand and thus can push the prices up.The taxpayer is losing out, those DLA cars would be getting better auction pricesthe number of buyers was not restricted and thus less funds are going back into the government.The cost of motoring is a big part of the overall cost of living crisis.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe interim boss would not be drawn on reports that Ajax boss Erik Ten Hag had been lined up as the next permanent appointment at Old Trafford, saying his focus was purely on Saturday’s trip to relegation-battling Everton.Rangnick was also asked about his own future at the end of a week in which the Austrian Football Association denied having spoken to the -year-old about their vacant manager’s position, and said he would discuss his two-year consultancy contract at the end of the season.But askedhe would be offering thorough insight to the next manager, Rangnick said: “I have already done this, not to any managers, but inside the club.“I have told them how I see the current squad and what needs to happen in my opinion. The rest I cannot answer now because it depends on the new manager. If he is interested and willing to speak about that and interested in my opinion, I will need to wait and see what happens.”And asked what would be the most important advice he could offer a new manager, Rangnick added: “If the new manager has been announced, thenhe wants to get my advice then I am more than happy to speak to the new manager about that.Three goals and three points in our last #PL visit to Goodison Park 💪🔴#MUFC | #EVEMUN pic cfABjCrdm— Manchester UnitedApril , “But right now it will be something in private and internally, that we need to discuss.”United face a busy summer, not only with the arrival of a new boss, but also in rebuilding a squad which is set to lose six out-of-contract players – Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Edinson Cavani, Juan Mata, Tahith Chong and Lee Grant – while many others on the fringes face uncertain futures.When Rangnick was hired, much was made of his role in creating the influential gergenpress amid hopes he could install a coherent philosophy at a club which has a bloated squad made up of players signed by five dferent managers..removeBut though he said he had spoken to the board “and they know what I think needs to happen in the summer”, Rangnick was clear the final decisions on several iniduals would rest with his successor. vw,vw,px, px\"Donny Van De Beek is on loan at Everton Answering a question on whether Donny Van De Beek, on loan at Everton but unable to face his parent club this weekend, had a future at Old Trafford, Rangnick said: “I will not be the manager next season.“It also depends on how you want to play. Do you want to play more possession based or counter pressing, pressing kind of football  It depends on that and what other kind of players are coming.“The squad needs to be rebuilt in the summer, that is clear.“But again, those are questions that it doesn’t make sense to speak about right now.”Luke Shaw is one of four players ruled out of Saturday’s lunchtime fixture – Raphael Varane, Scott McTominay and Edinson Cavani are also missing – with Rangnick revealing the England left-back needs an operation to remove metal screws from his leg dating to his double leg-break in .🚨 Four first-team Reds have been ruled out of Saturdays #PL encounter.#MUFC | #EVEMUN— Manchester UnitedApril , “To me it came quite unexpectedly to be honest and the same is true of our medical department,” Rangnick said.“He told me in the international break when he was with the England squad that he had some problems there and he played against Leicester and five minutes before half-time he had an issue and had to be treated on the pitch.“At half-time the doctor came to see me and said he could not continue and since then we have been discussing what is best and they decided to have the two bolts removed.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Ralf Rangnick: Future consultancy role at Manchester United depends on new boss article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFrom ice cream cone creations to vegan and gluten-free chocolate, I wanted to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.Salted caramel Easter eggsThere is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. .removeSome of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.The verdict: Which Aldi chocolate Easter eggs are worth buying From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website hereThe Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/20048484.aldi-lidl-middle-aisles-thursday/res","title":"aldi lidl middle aisles thursday","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Each autumn, Jays, a colourful member of the crow family, can often be seen flying back and forth finding and hiding acorns to help see them through the winter. These are then hidden in the cracks and crevices of trees, but also in leaf litter on the ground. An inidual jay can store around , acorns each year and many remain buried to grow into oak trees.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Mother and her daughter counting birds in their garden, Bedford, UK, January The RSPB’s Chief Executive, Beccy Speight said “We don’t know the reasons for the sudden increase in Jay sightings this year. It may be down to food availability as we have reports that last year was poor for acorns, but whatever the reason a sighting of this stunning bird is enough to raise one’s spirits any day of the year let alone on a gloomy January weekend.“It’s been brilliant to see so many people taking part again this year, taking time out to watch and reconnect with birds and then generously submit their sightings to help RSPB scientists gain some insights into how our garden birds are faring.”Big Garden Birdwatch results also found a small increase in Greenfinch compared to . This gives scientists a glimmer of hope that this might be the first signs of a popuation recovery, but only time will tell. In recent years the Greenfinch has suffered a population crashcaused by a severe outbreak of the disease trichomonosis and as a consequence the species was added to the UK Red list last year. This infection is spread through contaminated food and drinking water, or by birds feeding one another with regurgitated food during the breeding season. Garden owners can help slow transmission rates by temporarily stopping the provision of foodill birds are seen and making sure that garden bird feeders are cleaned regularly.The House Sparrow remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings as the most commonly seen garden bird with more than . million recorded sightings throughout the weekend. Blue Tit and Starling remained in the number two and three positions respectively.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Family filling up a bird feeder in their garden, Potton, Bedfordshire, UK, January Over its four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world.

Woodpigeon was the most numerous species seen with an average of eight per school and was seen in % of all schools that took part. Blackbird was a close second with an average of seven per school.Beccy added: “Connecting with nature doesn’t have to stop with Big Garden Birdwatch.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures larne music festival returns after two year absence ","story":"Newtownabbey PSNI arrest man on suspicion of assault and theft   Two people rushed to hospital after crash at Rushmere roundabout in CraigavonNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleThe committee of Larne Music Festival has thanked all who supported and attended this year.

These will be taken in conjunction with GMB who also represents bus workers at Translink. The strike action planned will be a week, starting April  and concluding on May , as well as a single day on Friday, May . The strike comes after members of the union overwhelmingly voted for industrial action after rejecting the latest Translink management pay offer. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham expressed her support for the striking bus workers. She said, “These bus workers are frontline workers – they deserve respect and a pay increase. Translink needs to grasp that there’s a cost of living crisis destroying the value of wages andwith a more acceptable offer. “Unite’s members have my full support and that of their union in taking this strike action for fairer pay.” Unite deputy Regional Secretary Davy Thompson is lead officer for Translink, Northern Ireland’s bus and rail public transport provider. He added:“Unite represents the overwhelming majority of bus workers, and this strike action taken in conjunction with GMB which also represents bus workers will shut down all bus services. “Bus workers deserve a pay increase. The ball is in the court of Translink management. They can to avoid this unnecessary and highly disruptive strike – they need to address our members’ legitimate pay expectations.” Meanwhile, Peter Macklin, GMB Organiser, said:Every worker deserves fair pay. With rampant inflation, this real terms cut is a slap in the face and will leave many struggling to cover their bills. “Translinkfails to recognise what workers went through during the pandemic. “They kept transport running so other essential workers could get to and from workplaces to perform vital roles. “Our members were proud to carry out their duty in delivering the service, potentially putting themselves and their families at risk. When we clapped every Thursday night, we said the essential workers would not be forgotten or left behind. But during this cost of living crisis, Translink is forgetting their own workers. “The dispute, which affects bus drivers, cleaners and shunters will close the entire bus network within Northern Ireland. It will be a complete shutdown.” A Translink spokesperson said they were disappointed that the unions hadvoted to take industrial action. “Following extensive negotiations, including with the Labour Relations Agency, we made a pay offer of % plus an enhanced package of conditions that included a % increase in weekend and overtime rates along with  extra days holiday, they said. “We believe this was a fair and reasonable offer and have at all times been open to discussions. We remain committed to working with the unions to avert this action. “We would welcome the opportunity to engage with unions to cover school duties, so that the wellbeing of schoolchildren can remain a priority. “All train services will continue to operate as normal. “We will communicate relevant passenger information through the media, on our website www.translink, through social media, in stations and on buses and trains. “Translink apologises for any inconvenience this may cause”.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffcacbbcbdfd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adfaca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
