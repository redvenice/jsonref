What should you be getting for your money? Is everyone else putting up with a shower in the kitchen?Second in our series is Jess, 24, who lives in Deptford.(Picture: Alexander CrawleyusSo, how much are you paying?I pay £580 a month which includes all bills including council tax.And what are you getting for that princely sum?The flat is in Deptford in South East. It’s zone 2 but a wee bit out of the way so no tube line unfortunately.There’s four bedrooms in total, and since I moved in a few months ago one of the rooms has been empty. A new girl just moved in recently, so perhaps it’s going to be a fight to get to the shower in the mornings, but I reckon a house of four is not too bad.There are two bathrooms, but one of those is just a toilet and a sink.The groundfloor bathroom is just a toilet and a sink. (Picture: Alexander CrawleyusHow long have you lived there?I’ve lived here since the end of February after a fire at my old flat meant I had to move pretty sharpish. I’m still kinda in that in-between place where I’ve got to buy stuff for my room and the kitchen, so not fully at home yet but getting there.How did you find this place? Every flat I’ve lived in since I moved to London two years ago was from SpareRoom.It’s pretty hit and miss, and plenty of dodgy agents, but not all bad. I’m really careful now after some bad experiences – including a creepy landlord who used to call me at night ‘just to chat’.I am happy here, but because of the circumstances of moving it’s not quite ‘home’ to me. I love the area so much (great markets, lovely people, a really good local) that I’d struggle to live anywhere else in London.My housemates are nice too, striking the balance between cool and chatty but not all up in my personal space. I also think I’ve managed to put a bit of a stamp on my room so it feels like my own – so many people I know just have a white box with their clothes in. That sounds like hell to me.Do you feel like you have enough space?Space isn’t really an issue, but there definitely isn’t enough storage for me.There are no drawers in her room, so Jess makes do with some small shelves. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)At the moment my underwear is all in some Ikea shelf because there are no drawers, and I’ve got loads of storage containers full of shoes. Get me a wardrobe like Kylie Jenner’s and I’ll never complain again.I’d also want space to put a TV in my room. Netflix on my laptop makes me feel like a teenage boy.And the people you live with. Did you know them before you moved in together?Nope, all new people.I’ve considered living with my best friend, but being a bit of an introvert I’m not sure they’d cope with my need to be by myself a lot of the time.Also I’d rather not fight with an IRL friend over blocked sinks and who took the bins out last.Are there any major issues with your renting situation that you have to put up with?The glaring issue with this flat is that there’s no bath. I’m not quite sure how I’m surviving without one as it used to be my way to relax after a hard day, and I’ve nearly died a few times trying to stretch in the shower cubicle when it’s time to shave my legs.There are also some issues with mould and ants (I promise I’m a clean person, but they both just KEEP COMING BACK) and although the landlord is supposed to come over to clean once a week I don’t ever notice anything being clean – sorry, landlord.The bathroom sink. (Picture: Alexander CrawleyusIt’s just an old flat so no matter how much you clean there’s still rusty bits and broken things. In an ideal world it’d get renovated and be boujee as hell, but for under £600 all in I can’t see it happening any time soon.As you can see in the photos, the thermostat is in a weird locked box. There’s a locked cupboard with stuff in it that we could really use sometimes (like a mop and basic tools).I’m not sure if the landlord doesn’t trust us or he’s had issues with people in the past, but it takes away from any comfortable vibe the flat might have had – like a constant reminder it’s not ‘our place’.Oh, also, not to be a grass, but none of the windows work properly which freaks the sh*t out of me since my housemates nearly died in the fire at my last flat. It does keep me awake some nights worrying I wouldn’t be able to get out if anything happened, but there’s not much I can do about it.The thermostat is in a locked box. (Picture: Alexander CrawleyusAny plans to move?I’m planning on moving in the next few months but trying not to rush it and find something I love rather than moving for moving’s sake like last time.I want a bath in the next place and perhaps more of a homely vibe with somewhere I can stay for a few years. Also, a cat. If there’s a cat involved I’m signing that lease ASAP.And, um, any plans to buy?Hahaha what a cute question. No, on a journalist’s salary I’m not looking into buying anywhere, but if anyone wants to PayPal me £100k for a deposit after seeing how I live I’ll send you my deets.Feel free to give us £100k while you’re at it. In the meantime, let’s have a look around Jess’s place:But other than that, she’s pretty happy. Even when she is lurking in the corner.

Konstantin, from Moscow, said: \u0027So our team has been in many different places - I\u0027d say we have come through both ice and fire, but this trip to Baikonur was the toughest in all the senses of this word.\u0027 Pictured: His team standing at the base of the rocket in Baikonur, with metal platforms rising to the top on either side           The ageing spacecraft are kept in the enormous Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is based in a Russian enclave deep within Kazakhstan\u0027s desert steppe. Baikonur was the world\u0027s first and largest space launch facility, with both Sputnik 1 (the first artificial Earth satellite) and Yuri Gagarin\u0027s Vostok 1 (responsible for the first manned spaceflight) launched from it. Now the facility is home to two shuttles that sit gathering dust after the termination of the Buran Space Program in 1993. Pictured: Two members of the team stand on one of the abandoned craft, which is literally gathering dust           Konstantin said: \u0027I hope our story will be interesting for everyone and I will be invited to work in Roskosmos - I like to photograph spaceships. Also I need to say that as a result of this trip we decided to build our own rocket - which is what we are actively dealing with now. It was a long way ahead - only a little bit shorter than to Paris. There were a lot of interesting things to see (with no tickets, special tours, approvals and so on) and of course adventures.\u0027 Pictured: A small doorway at the spaceport           His five-man team journeyed 15,500 miles in total from their Moscow starting point and had to turn off their headlights to avoid being seen by guards. Konstantin said: \u0027Baikonur is 2500km from Moscow. Going there by car is the cheapest and easiest way. The plan was as easy as the following: using offline maps - we wanted to get by car as close as possible in the desert then leave a car and walk through the sand towards the buildings of cosmodrome\u0027. Pictured: The spaceport, photographed from the long grass on its periphery           Describing his journey, the photographer said: \u0027We didn\u0027t want to be seen from the cosmodrome - that\u0027s why we drove with the lights off, sometimes using portable torches to light the way. But soon the car got stuck and we had to continue walking - we still had about two days before the launch. We were heading towards the biggest workshop on the territory of the cosmodrome.\u0027 Pictured: A rocket they found at the base           Konstantin said he used many of the old buildings to hide from detection. He explained: \u0027All those abandoned buildings were just a perfect place to hide. There were many places not to be noticed or found by the cosmodrome workers\u0027          Two large buildings at the base were photographed at night, with the starry Kazakh desert sky bright overhead. Konstantin described the secret mission as an adventure           During the final leg of the journey - a walk - it was hard to remain hidden, he said, explaining: \u0027It took us about 6 hours to walk 22km - and it was a point when we saw the buildings of the cosmodrome, then we had to move like partisans in order not to be seen and we still had to walk 4-6 km to get to the point.\u0027 Pictured: Their prize, an abandoned shuttle           The team of adventurers also climbed into the space shuttle and took photographs of the cockpit, which contained many of the original dials and toggles           The audacious snaps were taken by Konstantin Kosmodemiansky, a blogger and photographer from Moscow who trekked 17 miles through the desert with his friends in order to capture the bizarre scene          The ageing shuttles reside in a massive spaceport that sits alone, miles from any other settlements.

But now he\u0027s been told to pipe down because he\u0027s too loudFollowing a single complaint, Wayne has been ordered to keep quiet. \u0027The council said they had a phone call from a woman saying we were making so much noise shouting. The official said it was under some sort of noise pollution regulation.\u0027Originally, they told him he couldn\u0027t shout until after lunch, but now the ban has been extended all day.Wayne, who pays £340 a month for his pitch, is understandably livid. \u0027The market has been there for hundreds of years and now someone moves into the High Street and decides they don\u0027t like the noise. It\u0027s part and parcel of street life. It\u0027s part of the atmosphere.\u0027If stall-holders cannot shout, then you lose part of that tradition. If I don\u0027t shout out I\u0027m going to be at least 30 to 40 per cent down on profit.\u0027Market traders are already struggling, like so many small shops today. Town centres are dying, not just because of online competition and out-of-town superstores, but as a result of extortionate rents, sky-high business rates and draconian parking regimes.Lymington is fortunate still to enjoy a vibrant market culture. So why the does the council seem hell-bent on destroying it?                             It\u0027s part and parcel of street life. It\u0027s part of the atmosphere. If stall-holders cannot shout, then you lose part of that tradition. If I don\u0027t shout out I\u0027m going to be at least 30 to 40 per cent down on profit.                         Greengrocer Wayne BellowsThe town\u0027s mayor, Barry Dunning, said he sympathises with Wayne and describes the market as Lymington\u0027s \u0027crown jewel\u0027. But, with the authentic voice of the Great British Jobsworth, he said the council had no option other than to intervene.\u0027Nuisance can be whatever you want to make it. We had a complaint and we had to follow it up.\u0027No, they didn\u0027t. They could have said to the woman who objected: \u0027Thank you, madam, but the market has been central to life in Lymington for the past 800 years and traders shouting is an integral part of that. We\u0027ve got better things to do than hang around the market with a decibel meter measuring the cries of fruit and veg sellers to see if they breach noise pollution regulations. Have a nice day.\u0027Not every complaint has to be taken seriously and acted upon accordingly. Just because someone objects to something, it doesn\u0027t mean it should be banned.This isn\u0027t the first time a market trader has fallen foul of an inidual with a grievance. Last October, I brought you the saga of Tina Gayle, a stall-holder on Loughborough market, in Leicestershire, who had her licence to trade withdrawn by the local council.Her \u0027crime\u0027 was to refuse to stop selling coffee mugs depicting the ancient order of the Knights Templar.

A council spokesman said: \u0027We want the public to have a safe and enjoyable experience when visiting our markets and we have a duty to ensure that items sold do not cause public offence. It\u0027s not for us to comment on why the mugs were offensive to the complainant.\u0027Yes, it is. Why should a single complaint — whether about \u0027offensive\u0027 coffee mugs or a stall-holder shouting too loudly — be sufficient to threaten someone else\u0027s right to earn a living, or end a centuries-old tradition?And while councils are only too willing to dance to the tune of aggrieved iniduals, they have no compunction in ignoring wider public opinion, especially when it comes to market traders. The reason that vendors such as Wayne Bellows now sell their fruit and veg in £1 \u0027bowls\u0027 — and not the pounds and ounces most of their customers would prefer — is because of the war on imperial measures pursued with Stalinist zeal by Town Halls all over Britain.Councils started persecuting market traders 20-odd years ago, forcing them to adopt metric weights and measures to \u0027bring us into line with Europe\u0027.Fishmongers, greengrocers and butchers were all charged with criminal offences because they wouldn\u0027t use kilograms.One fruit and veg merchant, Steve Thoburn, from Sunderland, was dragged through the courts for the heinous offence of using imperial scales.Public opinion was firmly on his side, but that didn\u0027t stop the authorities fighting him all the way to the European Court of Human Rights.Mr Thoburn died of a heart attack soon after losing his final appeal, aged just 39. He was hounded to death by officialdom.The Brexit vote was motivated not just by a desire to regain control of our own laws and borders. It was a rejection of the political class at every level, from Brussels right down to parish pump.That includes the jumped-up jobsworths who think they have the right to micro-manage our lives and stop market traders doing something they\u0027ve been doing for 800 years simply because of a single complaint from someone who finds it \u0027offensive\u0027.Wayne Bellows should tell them all to go to hell. At the top of his voice. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/17/07/4B39269A00000578-0-image-m-22_1523948022785.jpg","title":"Collars pets ELECTRIC SHOCKS help SAFE humane vets say","story":"    Pictured: One of the shock collars modelled on a dog Collars which give pets mild electric shocks to help keep them safe in gardens are humane and in the animals’ best interests, vets say.The collars are used by 40,000 pet owners in the UK and buzz before sending a mild electrical pulse to the animal if it crosses a boundary.Others, known as remote training devices, allow an owner or trainer to deliver a shock to the animal at the push of a button if it misbehaves.Last month the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced a ban on both types of collar after pressure from the RSCPA and other animal rights campaigners. It could come into force as early as the end of this month.

However, they acknowledged that the market had reacted to uncertainty over succession planning at WPP, compounding a performance that has resulted in shares in the group declining by a third over the past year. One of WPP’s largest shareholders, Harris Associates, said it was “regrettable” to have a leadership transition without Sorrell’s involvement. “It highlights the apparent lack of detailed succession planning that has troubled us and many other observers for some time,” Roddy Davidson, an analyst at investment group Shore Capital, said. “We are not overly concerned about the immediate impact of Sorrell’s departure on the group’s flagship agencies as these are major international enterprises in their own right, with strong performance track records and independent management structures. That said, the resultant vacuum at the top of the company is not ideal.”It may not seem like it but Sir Martin Sorrell had a career before WPP. His affair with advertising began as Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi’s first finance directorSorrell made his first step toward global domination at the age of 40, investing in a small Kent-based maker of wire baskets called Wire \u0026amp Plastic ProductsSorrell announces himself on the global stage by buying J Walter Thompson, the world’s oldest ad agency and an iconic US brand for $566m.

He stepped down on 14 AprilSorrell, 73, has “unreservedly denied” the misconduct allegations and WPP’s board has said it will not be publishing the outcome of the investigations into them by an independent law firm. The decision not to publish was criticised by the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, who said there was a “real lack of transparency” and “any investigations done by the company should be made public”. The company said it had concluded the investigation and had no further comment to make. After years of above-par performances WPP put out two growth warnings last year – before reporting its worst financial year since the 2009 ad recession – as clients pulled budgets and investors started to question the future of the global holding company model in the increasingly digital age.“Whether WPP should survive in its current form is a more challenging question,” Davidson said. “Particularly as an increasingly complex and dynamic media landscape, and growing competition from more focused players will, in our view, require a degree of flexibility and agility that large holding companies could struggle to deliver.”A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders to succeed Sorrell, including the chief executive of publishing and exhibitions group Informa, Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, the cable firm NTL and at WPP’s ad agency JWT Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and Andrew Robertson, chief executive of WPP rival Omnicom’s global BBDO ad network.The frontrunning internal candidates are Mark Read, the chief executive of Wunderman and WPP Digital, and Andrew Scott, a top executive at WPP’s European operation, who were appointed WPP’s joint chief operating officers following Sorrell’s departure on Saturday.“We believe Sir Martin will be hard to replace with one person,” Paul Richards, analyst at Numis, said. “The succession has led to questions over the size and scope of WPP. Our base case is for a new management team to continue and refine the existing strategy, though we acknowledge that any group without a chief executive is vulnerable to a bid approach in the interregnum.”Alex DeGroote, analyst at Cenkos Securities, puts the break-up value of WPP’s parts at about £17 a share, valuing the group at £22bn. WPP’s current share price is £11.50, a market capitalisation of £15bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ca1b3b73e16f2e6156c67352b1a99eea016cc9/0_219_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=940b13908e464f2d2a520337f6d8da91 1240w","title":"pound brexit high uk pay wages inflation unemployment rate business live","story":"After a year of pain, UK wages are rising (a little) faster than inflation againVia Resolution Foundation, here’s confirmation that real pay (wages minus inflation) is rising fastest in the financial world but still shrinking in the public sector, and beyond....The small boost from the pick-up in wages could be wiped out for many borrowers if the Bank of England raises interest rates.Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, says people should tackle their spending before the next rate hike lands:“Now isn’t the time to start splashing the cash, you should make hay while the sun shines and keep control of your spending. Create a budget and make sure you aren’t spending any more than you need too. Spend 30 minutes looking at where you could make savings, from switching where you do your weekly shop to changing your energy supplier. Half an hour of research and admin could save you hundreds, if not thousands a year.”This chart shows how wages have caught up with inflation, after around a year of falling real pay:And this one shows how the jobless rate is the lowest since Harold Wilson’s premiership:Britain’s unions have welcomed the news that workers’ pay has finally caught up with rising prices - but warned that earnings are still too weak:TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady says the government must do more: Unions have negotiated pay rises for workers across the UK, from the counters at McDonald’s to the factory floor at Ford.“But wage growth is still weak. Workers are £14 a week worse off than they were in 2007 – with pay packets not expected to return to their pre-crisis level until 2025.“This is why tens of thousands of people will march through London on Saturday 12 May as part of the TUC’s ‘A New Deal for Working People’ demonstration.“The government must get the economy working again for working people. Ministers need to increase the minimum wage to £10 an hour, fund a proper pay rise for all public servants, and give workers stronger rights to negotiate fair pay deals.”Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Esther McVey, has hailed the news that Britain’s employment rate has hit a new all-time high.“Another milestone for employment has been reached under this Government as employment reaches a record high, up 3.2 million since 2010 - the 16th time the employment record has been broken in the same period.“That means on average, over 1,000 people have moved into work every day since 2010, and credit has to be given to the businesses who have created those jobs and the iniduals who are taking those opportunities.Tara Sinclair of George Washington University tweets:All this talk of pay rises may have a hollow ring in Britain’s public sector, where the government’s austerity programme has kept wage growth pinned on the mat for several years.The Resolution Foundation points out that pay is not rising uniformly across the UK - instead, those in the City have been enjoying inflation-busting pay rises for a while: Real pay (adjusted for inflation) has been rising by almost 2.8 per cent for those in finance for the past year, and 1.5 per cent for those in construction, yet the squeeze continues in the public sector. Stephen Clarke, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, adds:“Today’s figures confirm that Britain passed an important living standards milestone in early 2018 as its 12-month pay squeeze finally ended. Wages should continue to strengthen over the course of the year as inflation falls back.“It’s good to see pay finally back in positive territory, but Britain has a lot of ground to make up after an awful decade of pay squeezes, stagnation and all too fleeting recoveries. On average, people are still taking home less than they did before the crisis.My colleague Richard Partington points out that falling inflation, rather than bumper pay rises, is behind the pick-up in real wages:That’s because the slump in the pound since the EU referendum has now largely passed through the economic system, especially given sterling’s recent rally.Geraint Johnes, research director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, says the UK jobs market is “gradually returning to a healthy state”. These trends seem to confirm that the labour market is gradually returning to a more stable state following a period in which many workers took on gig employment as a stop-gap in the aftermath of the recession.” Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, explains: “For the first time in more than a year, British workers are not feeling progressively poorer month by month....Wage growth has been the missing piece of the puzzle in Britain’s long, slow recovery from the financial crisis. With the final piece now in place the Bank of England now has the catalyst to be able to follow through on its plans to raise interest rates at the next MPC meeting in May and start the move back towards monetary normality.Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, says the real wage squeeze on the average UK worker is coming to an end (and not before time!). While most of this improvement has been due to a collapse in inflation – something that should be shown to have continued tomorrow – businesses are paying higher wages as the labour market in the UK tightens.Unemployment is currently at its lowest level since the mid-1970s and hopefully, that will propel higher wages for months to come. As we have noted before, real wage gains are the silver bullet for the UK economy.Real wage growth is significant because it relies on optimistic employers being happy with business conditions, it allows consumers to re-balance spending figures from credit uptake and it promotes growth in generalised output with a central bank more comfortable to normalise monetary policy.”Today’s labour market report shows that there are now 32.26 million people in work, 427,000 more than a year ago.The number of people classed as unemployed has dropped by 136,000 over the last year, and now stands at 1.42 million.Basic pay in the UK is now rising at its fastest rate since August 2015, as this chart from the ONS shows:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d98d14d75f2f9e1c376153af65a5407844564327/1184_1499_6479_3886/master/6479.jpg?w=6250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6e99d4abd1035401f8f6e9db394397c 12500w","title":"the ghost streets of 1960s birmingham in pictures janet mendelsohn richard p rogers","story":"In 1968, American photographers Janet Mendelsohn and Richard P.

Yet with less than a year to go, and vital questions still unanswered, Westminster’s interest has palpably waned. That partly reflects public disengagement. Europe is not raised much on the doorstep, say MPs, who are mostly grateful to talk about other things.There are pockets of Brexit passion. On Sunday hundreds of people went to the north London launch of the People’s Vote, a cross-party campaign demanding a referendum on the final deal. A smaller counter-demonstration asserted the view (prevalent outside the capital) that one referendum was enough. In news terms, that event was no competitor to airstrikes in Syria or wrangles with Russia over the Salisbury poisonings.Inevitably EU affairs drop out of the headlines from time to time. But there has been a general downgrade in Brexit urgency since provisional agreement was reached last month on a transition period. That means the article 50 deadline of next March applies only to the terms of withdrawal. The future trading relationship can be outlined in a “political declaration”, with 21 extra months to fill in the details.Hardline leavers don’t like this smudging of Brexit boundaries, but they haven’t kicked up a fuss because they recognise that transition is a lethal trap for the remain cause. It kills EU membership right on time next March, while deferring any painful impact until 2021, well beyond current political attention s.Pro-Europeans already find it hard to foment mass opposition to Brexit, not least because the leader of the\u0026nbspLabour party is happy leaving the EU. But the challenge of lobbying to preserve membership now is child’s play compared to how hard it would be petitioning for re-admission once the doors to the club have banged shut.Transition doesn’t diminish the need for a deal, but elongating the timetable has taken some of the clock-ticking drama out of the story, easing pressure on Theresa May. Yet none of the problems that seemed desperate in January have gone away. There is still no magical method for keeping an invisible border in Northern Ireland while leaving the customs union. There is still no rival to the Treasury’s cost-benefit analysis showing only a downside to exit from the single market. A substantial majority of MPs still believe that Brexit is an exercise in damage limitation. Yet few dare to follow that logic to the end: when an action can only be measured in damage, the best limitation strategy is not to do it at all.Deference to the referendum result is a powerful factor here, but not the only one. There is also our political and media culture that much prefers characters to processes. Brexit blips on to British radars not when important things happen in Brussels, but when Westminster politics turn colourful. A boisterous banality by Boris Johnson makes a splash. A technocratic torpedo in the form of a commission negotiating mandate, blasting holes in May’s Brexit ambitions, causes barely a ripple.It has never been easy to excite a British audience with the technicalities of the EU. It is hardest of all with those who voted leave hoping it meant they would never have to be bothered by such things again. And there is great, understated power in the politics of not being bothered. There were many remainers in 2016 who had no affection for the EU but didn’t think it was worth the hassle of leaving. As Brexit day gets nearer, the balance of being bothered shifts. It starts to look like a palaver to go back.Economists call this the sunk-cost fallacy – the tendency to factor in the psychological cost of time and money already spent when making a choice about the future. This is why people tend to buy random useless things, having driven a long way to get to the shops. To leave empty-handed feels like a waste of all that time on the road. But the lost time is irrecoverable – a sunk cost. It should have no rational bearing on current purchases.The months of fractious politics, social ision and economic uncertainty are the sunk costs of Brexit. They shouldn’t weigh against the potential benefits of retaining membership if, after gruelling negotiations, that looks like the best item on the menu. But a false intuition puts the weight there. British politics is deep in that fallacy. There is no enthusiasm in parliament for May’s Brexit, but nor is there a coherent lobby for a U-turn. Jeremy Corbyn is wedded to the idea of a better, socialist kind of Brexit. Most Tory MPs will vote for May’s bad deal if the alternative is a crisis that somehow propels Corbyn into No 10.The prime minister herself increasingly calls to mind\u0026nbspMacbeth, wearily committed to seeing a nasty business through to the end, “in blood stepp’d in so far, that should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o’er”.Tedious, maybe. Not impossible. But it needs political courage and imagination. Those qualities are in short supply. There is instead growing complacency and fatalism around Brexit. The question of whether it should be done is treated as taboo by May and Corbyn. But the question of how it should be done hasn’t produced a credible answer to beat the option of not doing it at all. So we creep in this petty pace towards the final act, as if it were all predestined. It isn’t. If the UK does end up leaving the EU, the referendum result will be only half the reason. The other half will be a parliament that knew Britain was going the wrong way, yet couldn’t be bothered to lead the way back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be2a2c7ad1b276242f7d5a6721b7a2bb116c8af6/0_323_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2128626c0be0fc4e94d2b833ef23c241 1240w","title":"oxford cambridge universities private raise fees","story":"Income loss from tuition fees cap could prompt a break from state control, which other institutions might followAs universities wait to see if the government will cut tuition fees – and therefore their income – one of the most controversial questions of all is being discussed. Could Oxford and Cambridge universities opt to break free from state control and go private?The government launched its review of post-18 education in February. With the Tories keen to woo young voters, following Jeremy Corbyn’s commitment to end tuition fees, a reduction of the £9,250 fees cap is widely expected. But vice-chancellors say quality could be threatened if the government does not plug any gap with new funding.Unlike other universities, Oxford and Cambridge say fees, even at £9,250, do not cover the costs of the tutorial-led teaching for which they are famous. A spokesperson for Cambridge would not comment about going private, but said each student costs an average of £18,500 a year to teach.It has been on the cards since the\u0026nbspConservatives\u0026nbsppromised a major review of funding across tertiary education in their election manifesto. With graduate debt running at £50,000 upwards, there has been growing concern about the cost of going to university and whether it represents value for money. Fees in the UK are among the highest in the world, and some doubt there will be a return on such a huge investment in terms of graduate earnings.The government is\u0026nbsppromising a wide-ranging review\u0026nbspof the whole of post-18 education and funding, including the ide between vocational and academic qualifications and the decline in lifelong and part-time study. Most of the interest will be in undergraduate tuition fees, which stand at a hefty £9,250 a year at all but a handful of universities.The government will not seek to match\u0026nbspLabour’s promise to axe tuition fees\u0026nbspaltogether, which the Conservatives regard as unaffordable and regressive. The review could recommend cutting or freezing fees. One of the most controversial options is the introduction of variable fees for different courses, depending on the cost of putting a course on, potential graduate earnings and the economic value to the country. So some universities might for example cut their fees for social science and humanities courses, which generally attract lower graduate earnings than engineering or maths.Not very. With the review set to run for a year, reporting in early 2019, the government has been accused of kicking the issue into the long grass. If you are applying to start university this September, nothing will have substantially changed.If they declared themselves independent, they could set their own fees and not have to endure state regulation, which requires them to prove the quality of their research – and what they do with it – plus that of their teaching and the amount their graduates earn.Matt Robb, of EY-Parthenon, a consultancy that advises universities, says: “Oxford and Cambridge are currently in the top five institutions in the world. If that status were threatened by loss of funding or other factors, and this was the only solution, I think they wouldn’t blink in pushing to go private.”Some experts argue that this could solve a conundrum for ministers, who want to cut fees but don’t want to damage two such stellar British brands.Butler adds that other elite universities might follow. A senior Oxbridge college figure agrees: “It would really only work if Oxford and Cambridge, Imperial College London, UCL, Kings College London and the LSE all went together.”Speculation about what the top two could charge students varies, but several insiders suggest around £15,000. They insist this would allow Oxbridge to follow Harvard University and offer “needs blind” admissions. One academic manager says: “Perhaps just one third of students might pay the actual sticker price.” But such high fees would still stir up huge controversy.Lord Butler says: “I think the government might be anxious that independent universities would become like private schools and would be largely confined to the well off. However, that needn’t be the case as universities with strong brands could ensure that access could be completely means tested, with bursaries for families who could not afford the fees.”However Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says: “If they walk away from the regulatory system they are basically the same as private schools. No one chases Eton hard about needs-blind admissions.” If admissions were scrupulously fair, the private universities would be less likely to spend as much time and money on going into state schools and searching for talented students, he says.“People often talk about admissions in America in a very positive light, but although there are needs-blind admissions, Ivy League universities also give places to the children of donors and alumni. Part of moulding a class is handpicking the wealthy.”Money is not the only driver behind the latest rumblings. There is also resentment about the government’s drive to treat students as consumers and to assess the value universities offer them.Stephen Toope, Cambridge’s vice-chancellor, blogged last month: “For a generation now, politicians of all stripes have talked as if UK universities are broken, and hence in need of ‘market discipline’. They talk as if our students, smart and energetic people, are in need of protection. This is an own goal.”Another vice-chancellor, who has asked not to be named, says: “We are seeing a real threat to institutional autonomy from ministers. I think right now we must be the closest we’ve ever been to a point where Oxford and Cambridge will turn round and say, ‘Sod this, we are fed up with being criticised, we’ll go private’.”But many in the sector think this is a leap too far. Prof Simon Marginson, director of the centre for global higher education at UCL’s Institute of Education, agrees that deregulation is one “obvious answer” for Oxford and Cambridge, but says that changing the relationship between universities and the state would be hugely problematic.“In political terms, giving these universities what they want is the opposite of what the government needs to do at the moment,” he says. “It needs to show it is supporting poor people, not elite universities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932e37f93c32f74c0fcb8d1134a99074a9642256/0_137_2616_1569/master/2616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=237a77a905f50210ec66eea648e7ec35 1240w","title":"year 6 sats tests stressful ministers reform","story":"Ministers should find an alternative to the year 6 exams, which put enormous pressure on teachers and pupilsThe past few years have seen a glut of parents proclaiming they are going to boycott year 6 Sats, the government’s national primary tests. Instead of sending their child in to school for exam week, they will “educate them elsewhere”, in a park or a museum, to get around the school absence rules. This year is no exception. If enough parents followed the trend, would it ever finish off Sats, which have become increasingly unpopular?In the US, parental protest contributed to several states abandoning the Obama administration’s plan for a national curriculum, known as the “common core”, against which all children would be tested. And states that continued still face protests. Just last year, in Long Island, New York, almost 80,000 children boycotted their maths exams.Here in England, our boycotting bark is worse than its bite. In 2016, more than 45,000 people signed a petition supporting parents keeping their children at home on Sats day. But when test day came, only a few schools reported big absences.Yet there are some compelling reasons to remove children from the exams. Teachers are under serious pressure to get great results. Performance-related pay means their salary can be pegged to children’s scores and, if overall results are low, the school can be labelled as failing or “coasting”, enabling the government to remove the school’s management (which it is not afraid to do).Add this pressure on to a fragile teacher – maybe he or she is new, maybe this year the class has a few more struggling kids – and suddenly the pressure becomes too much. Now, their stress transfers to the pupils, and it’s only a matter of time until your 11-year-old comes home crying because she overheard her teacher saying it’ll ruin his life if the class don’t get great scores.It was this sort of pressure that led Jill Wood, the headteacher of Little London primary school in Leeds, to go and physically get a child out of bed on test day and put him in an exam hall with a sick bucket on standby.Last year she was the first headteacher to have her entire school boycott Sats, after she swore never again to put her children through the pressure for something she felt was so meaningless.But rebellion never comes free. Parents about to mark their calendars to keep their children home need to know that the tests can be taken at any time up to a week after the original date. To keep your child from being scored in maths or English, this year you would need to keep them home for at least six days.Secondly, most secondary schools use Sats scores to set children by ability, particularly in maths. Having no score on their report card can mean they are simply lumped into a middle-ability set. Even if the school does its own tests, it can often take at least a term for inaccuracies to be corrected.Without Sats, it would be difficult for the government to track, for example, if poorer children were falling behind in some schools more than in others. The tests may not be super reliable, but no data will make inequalities even harder to tackle.One alternative would be a “sample” test, given to a group of selected children across the country, without relaying the inidual data back to schools, thus diminishing the stress on teachers and reducing the relentless drilling most 11-year-olds endure in the months leading up to the tests .The government should consider this option, but so far it seems dead set against doing so.If you are planning to keep your child at home for six days next month, perhaps one of their educational activities could be writing to the minister to advocate for some better ideas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb3c993f3adbaedd4ff0891688b5b22843e5f1e5/56_160_2326_1395/master/2326.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=14e8aa27a6fe4a2a705f688a44700d2e 1240w","title":"chelsea manchester city women champions league semi finals","story":"The clubs head into their Champions League semis hampered by the demands moving from a summer to winter seasonChelsea’s manager, Emma Hayes, is no stranger to pressure. She led the club to the WSL1 and FA Cup double in 2015 and won the 2017 Spring Series. Yet this season the pressure has mounted in a very different way – and that is not a reference to her pregnancy with twins. Making the switch from a summer to a winter season has taken its toll.With Chelsea fighting for trophies on three fronts, the business end of the season has become brutally congested. The switch was designed to fit better with the international calendar and help teams to maintain momentum in the Champions League. Yet slotting matches around the clustered calendars of the women’s and men’s games, coupled with a host of postponements because of the cold winter, has wreaked havoc on the two teams still battling in Europe: Chelsea and Manchester City.Hayes, not known for being shy in voicing her opinion, has been brutal in her criticism of her team’s scheduling nightmare in recent weeks, this Sunday labelling Champions League success a “tall order for an English side” as a result.She is not repeating herself for the sake of it, because the extent of the problem was clear in Sunday’s FA Cup semi between Chelsea and City, who are separated by three points in WSL 1 (second-placed City having a game in hand).Such was Chelsea’s difficulty that the late sickness of forward Ramona Bachmann forced Hayes, who arguably has the strongest squad in the league, to name only four substitutes. Hayes described it as a challenging week with players suffering personal difficulties, injuries and sickness.The crisis was compounded in the buildup to this Sunday’s Champions League semi-final against Wolfsburg (and Wednesday’s trip to Everton first) by Maria Thorisdottir being taken off on a stretcher with an ankle problem. Meanwhile, Chelsea’s two‑goal match winner against City, Fran Kirby, having been sent home before England’s match against Bosnia-Herzegovina to look after a niggle, had a thigh wrapped up with ice as soon as the whistle blew. She insists she feels good but it is clear they are sailing close to the wind.City have similar problems. Having lost a host of players to injury after Christmas, derailing their league domination, they had eight call-ups to Phil Neville’s squad for the Lionesses’ recent World Cup qualifiers. To put that in context, Reading, not competing on three fronts as City were at the time, provided the next highest number: three.In some ways City are a victim of their own success but most teams have had players rested and training together at a crucial and busy juncture of the season while Nick Cushing has been without the core of his squad and had them at full pelt against Wales and then Bosnia‑Herzegovina in key internationals.At the season’s close, Chelsea will have played 12 midweek fixtures (with two games to be scheduled) and City 13 (with one still to be slotted in). That is approximately one-third of their matches. The latest for City comes on Wednesday at home to Sunderland. Their Champions League opponents, Lyon, who beat City at the same stage last season, will have played seven midweek fixtures come the end of the season, with two pairs of those coming consecutively with week-long breaks in between.When the four-times Champions League winners arrive at the Academy Stadium they will not have played for a week. While City were digging deep at Chelsea, Lyon put 11 past second ision side Arras FC away in the French Cup, with six different goalscorers (including an Ada Hegerberg hat-trick).Although Chelsea’s opponents, Wolfsburg, who knocked them out in their two previous Champions League outings (in the round of 32 last season and last 16 in 2015-16), may have a closer tally of midweek fixtures (12), they are also benefiting from kind scheduling around their European campaign. Sunday’s 4-1 win at home to Essen, who sit sixth in the Frauen Bundesliga – a Pernille Harder double sandwiched between goals from Caroline Graham Hansen and Sara Gunnarsdottir – was their last match before they head to Kingsmeadow.Fixture pile-ups are not uncommon. There is often criticism in the men’s game in England, particularly by sides in Europe. That men’s football has not been able to navigate a solution does not bode well. That said, the women’s game is not beholden to TV rights deals and broadcast schedules in the same way, and a league season with fewer teams in the ision provides more time to play with.For now, Hayes and Cushing are having to deal with undoubtedly one of the most difficult squad management scenarios of their careers. Whom to field, and risk, from their depleted squads on Wednesday is just the latest in the hard decisions they face this month.• South Korea beat the Philippines 5-0 in their Asia Cup fifth-place play-off to secure the final spot from Asia in the 2019 Women’s World Cup. Yoon Duk-yeo’s team join Australia – who reached the last four of the Asia Cup courtesy of a late Sam Kerr leveller against Japan – China, Japan and Thailand.• Chile, Colombia, Brazil and Argentina are through to the final stage of the Copa América. Brazil topped Group B with four wins from four and Argentina finished second after two penalties saw off Venezuela. There are two places at the World Cup in France up for grabs.• Manchester City’s senior side may have limped out of the FA Cup at the semi-final stage but on Saturday City came from behind to win the FA Youth Cup against Reading. Olivia Gardner headed the Royals ahead but a Maria Edwards hat-trick turned things around.• Swansea City won their third FAW Women’s Cup with a 2-1 victory over Cardiff. Alana Murphy put 11-times winners Cardiff ahead in the 54th minute but Jodie Passmore scored from the spot before Katy Hosford’s shot slipped through the hands of goalkeeper Ceryn Chamberlain to give the Swans victory.• England and Birmingham City striker Ellen White has been named WSL1 player of the month for March. Doncaster Rovers Belles’ Jess Sigsworth was named WSL2 player of the month.

Based on interviews with 92 women, the Amnesty report highlights the plight of thousands of female-headed families left to fend for themselves after their male relatives men were killed, arrested or forcibly disappeared while fleeing areas around Mosul. In many cases, the men’s only “crime” detailed in the report was escaping an Isis stronghold, or having a similar name to those on questionable “wanted lists”, or working in non-combat roles, such as cooks or drivers. The most serious allegations contained in the report relate to rape. Four women told researchers they had either witnessed rape or heard the screams of a woman in a nearby tent who was being raped by armed men, members of the camp administration, or other camp residents – with claims that women were being coerced into sexual relationships in exchange for desperately needed cash, humanitarian aid and protection from other men. One 20-year-old woman, Dana, said she had survived several rape attempts and was facing relentless pressure to have sex with a member of the security forces in her camp. “Because they consider me the same as an Isis fighter, they will rape me and return me,” she said.“They want to show everyone what they can do to me – to take away my honour. I can’t feel comfortable in my tent. I just want a door to lock and walls around me. Each night, I say to myself, ‘Tonight is the night I’m going to die.’” Many of the women interviewed by Amnesty in IDP camps expressed fears for their safety.Lynn Maalouf, the organisation’s Middle East research director, said: “Women are being subjected to dehumanising and discriminatory treatment by armed men operating in the camps for their alleged affiliation with Isis. “The very people who are supposed to be protecting them are turning into predators.“The Iraqi government must show it is serious about ending the violations against these women by holding all perpetrators to account and stopping all armed men from entering the camps.” The threat of sexual violence comes on top of evidence of other forms of abuse and discrimination aimed at the women, including the refusal of tribal elders to allow them to return to their home towns and villages. Those who do manage to return have experienced eviction, forced displacement, looting, threats and abuse, including sexual abuse and harassment, in some instances, seeing their houses defaced with the word “Daeshi” (or Isis) and having their electricity, water and other services cut off. “Sometimes I ask myself: why didn’t I just die in an airstrike?” said Maha, another woman interviewed for the report. “I attempted to commit suicide but I didn’t follow through. I put kerosene on myself, but before I set it on fire, I thought of my son. “I feel I am at my end. I am in a prison here. I am completely alone – without my husband, my father – no one is with me any more.”The situation for women is likely to get even worse as international funding for the humanitarian crisis in Iraq is projected to decrease sharply. Before Iraq’s parliamentary elections in May, displaced people are being urged to leave IDP camps as the government’s focus turns to closing and consolidating them.Maalouf added: “The authorities must also immediately end the systematic and widespread practice of forcibly disappearing men and boys with perceived ties to Isis, which has has left thousands of wives, mothers, daughters and sons in desperate situations.“To put an end to the poisonous cycle of marginalisation and communal violence that has plagued Iraq for decades, the Iraqi government and international community must commit to upholding the rights of all Iraqis without discrimination. Without this, there can be no national reconciliation or lasting peace.”Names have been changed to protect identities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87fcd104dfc37d674d2b96921cb05762a2c1181e/0_786_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7a948d46b75a4598a203b8b3fea01302 1240w","title":"why janelle monaes vagina pants make me cheer","story":"The pop star’s video for Pynk gives us Vagina Monologues for a new generation. It’s joyous, uplifting – and about as subtle as a sledgehammerVaginas don’t get the best press. They are either being grabbed by future US presidents, trolled on social media, en route to a labiaplasty, mistrusted for their monthly capacity to shed blood or weaponised in the endless debates over gender-neutral toilets. So when Janelle Monáe, a black, queer, working-class star, shows up in her latest music video sporting a giant pair of juicy vagina pants, it’s joyous and uplifting.The video of Pynk, Monáe’s new single, directed by Emma Westernberg and featuring the equally bonkers Grimes, is a queer, arch and deliciously sexy ode to the vagina. Those pants are essentially chaps reconfigured as hot-pink labia – and it doesn’t get gayer than that. In the video, Monáe and her gang of women romp around the desert, drive pink convertibles and wear knickers bearing slogans such as “I grab back” on them. We really need to come up with a female equivalent of “phallic” to do all this justice. Vulvic?So this is what pussy power reclaimed by black women in the 21st century looks like: fun and inclusive. The whole thing is, happily, about as subtle as a sledgehammer at one point Monáe’s rumoured girlfriend, the actor Tessa Thompson, pops her head out from between her billowing vagina legs with a saucy grin. And there are lots of, erm, vulvic shots of dripping ice lollies and manicured fingers pushing through doughnut holes. But the point is serious. Not all the women are wearing vagina pants because, well, not all women have vaginas. Or as Monáe put it on Twitter, “No matter if you have a vagina or not.” Thompson’s response to being thanked for “giving black girls their own Vagina Monologues” was: “to all the black girls that need a monologue that don’t have Vaginas, I’m listening”. Here’s the thing: vaginas can be enjoyed and celebrated by anyone, but everyone should respect them.It wasn’t that long ago – when I was growing up, in fact – that Whitney Houston’s skin was allegedly being lightened by her label in publicity shots and black artists were routinely expected to “cross over”. To be more white, in other words, if they wanted success. Monáe’s video, which has caused quite a ruckus online, is an unashamed celebration of black female sexuality.

Jalebi were my favourite as a child – golden, almost iridescent swirls of crisp batter soaked in a spiced sugar syrup. Traditionally, the batter is left overnight to ferment, giving it a sour tang. I’ve taken a shortcut and used yoghurt, but if you have any spare sourdough starter, it would make a perfect base for jalebi batter. Just add extra flour or water until you have the correct consistency.Apple juice is not part of the traditional recipe, but its sharpness works well with all the sugar. Any leftover syrup is fantastic drizzled over ice-cream or added to a glass of prosecco.For the syrup1 litre apple juice500g granulated or caster sugar4 green cardamom pods1 pinch saffron1 tbsp rosewaterFor the batter85g plain flour2 tbsp gram flour¼ tsp ground turmeric⅛ tsp bicarbonate of soda120ml Greek yoghurtA few tbsp water500ml-1 litre vegetable oil (depending on the size of your pan)Start by making the syrup: pour the juice and sugar into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Continue to boil until the volume has reduced by half, then turn off the heat and add the cardamom, saffron and rosewater. Set aside to cool.Make the batter by stirring together all the dry ingredients and then the yoghurt to make a thick paste. Gradually add water a little at a time, until you have a thick but pipeable consistency.Heat the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat (about 160C325F if you use a kitchen thermometer). When the oil is the correct temperature, a drop of batter should float to the surface and start bubbling almost immediately.Transfer the batter into a piping bag, snip off the end and quickly pipe swirls of it into the oil. Depending on the size of your pan, you will be able to fit two or three swirls per batch. Don’t worry if your piping skills are poor the batter has a habit of coalescing into an appropriate-looking shape on its own.Fry for 45 seconds on each side until the jalebi have taken on a slightly golden colour, then set aside on greaseproof paper to cool.Once the syrup and jalebi have cooled to just-warm, dip the swirls of batter into the syrup and leave to stand for a couple of hours before eating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7d6d664f58ca970bd64ee846c0f0336bed040e9/0_86_2009_1205/master/2009.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5c09be527ce6ff21d7ee9e7fb39e3323 1240w","title":"sheridan smith review bridgewater hall manchester","story":"Bridgewater Hall, ManchesterPresenting numbers from her recent covers album, the actor and singer can’t hold back the tears after a difficult two years – but her voracious talent turns the show into an exhilarating emotional rollercoasterWartime show tunes set the mood, before Sheridan Smith bounds on with a spotlight lighting her from behind and making her blonde locks glow like a halo. Her big hair, wiggly walk, red dress and lipstick ooze an old-fashioned, Marilyn Monroe sort of glamour. Only the tattoos creeping down each arm suggest that we are in 2018, but then that’s Smith all over. As one of the UK’s most accomplished actors, she is equally at home playing comic period characters such as Fanny Brice in Funny Girl or a council estate rough diamond in hard-hitting Shannon Matthews kidnap drama The Moorside.This two-hour show of orchestrated covers, laughs and introductory stories, though, is something else – and she admits to being nervous. “Usually, I play a role,” she explains, “but this is as if I’m naked. I promise not to take my clothes off … well, maybe in the second half.”She doesn’t, but there is plenty else on offer as she rattles from big, brassy, Shirley Bassey-type numbers (Big Spender, I Smell a Rat) to bump’n’grind send ups (Addicted to Love Superstar) and F-bomb-strewn banter. She says her water “is vodka really”, emits a loud burp (“sorry Mum!”), and turns the simple act of getting up on a high stool while wearing a tight dress into riotous, racy slapstick.She has had a tough time lately, and public struggles following her father’s death from cancer. “I’ve been crazy for a couple of years. You might have read about it,” she admits after a boisterous version of Gnarls Barkley’s Crazy makes being of unsound mind sound a hoot. But her spectral take on Rufus Wainwright’s Dinner at Eight is exactly as she introduces it: “A beautiful song about family.”In the second half, she strides on in a feather boa that makes her look like a giant bird, talks cheekily about “my Fanny” (referring to Brice) and introduces “Anyone ’oo Ever ’ad a ’Art by Burt Backer-crack”. Cilla Black – who sang the Bacharach song in the 1960s – was another of Smith’s great acting roles, and she reprises the voice uncannily, before donning rubber boobs for Dolly Parton’s 9 to 5 and ends Piece of My Heart by passing the mic to a bloke in the audience called Tommy, from Macclesfield.There is always a suspicion that all of this Carry On Sheridan is her way of healing, and gradually the wounds reopen. She dedicates a lovely version of Crystal Gayle’s Talking in Your Sleep to her mum in row L, and as she profusely thanks everyone for supporting her after her “shit time”, Tommy from Macclesfield is on hand again with a tissue, to wipe away her tears.It’s a testament to Smith’s artistic skills that she manages to sing the Dreamgirls torch song And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going despite quietly sobbing her way through it, but she recovers to turn This Is Me (“this is brave, this is bruised …”) from The Greatest Showman into a showstopping, audience arms-waving epic of determination.A segue from I Will Survive into Happy may have over-egged the emotional pudding, but the show careers between sublime and ridiculous with giddy gusto. Somewhere amid the chaos, brass, cheeky winks, knickers jokes and spine-tingling real hurt, is a glimpse into the demanding nature of Smith’s voracious talent: she gives everything of herself to everything she does."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea1f93858b2a86bfbe847e1c24c60a3bdb6743a/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5697bdbf0a52964c389819d3b58d7ac0 1240w","title":"brexit legislation caught in parliamentary logjam","story":"Almost half the bills needed to pave way for leaving EU have yet to be introduced to parliamentA parliamentary logjam will mean the government is likely to struggle to pass vital legislation paving the way for leaving the EU before the parliamentary vote on the final Brexit deal.Almost half of all the legislation that is needed has yet to be even introduced by ministers.MPs returned to parliament on Monday after the Easter recess – the 123rd day that parliament has sat since the general election – but the government is still to pass a single piece of Brexit legislation. Parliament will only sit for another 80 days before MPs are expected to vote on the final Brexit deal struck between Theresa May and the European Union, scheduled for October.The shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said there was now “a real danger” that MPs would be ask to vote on the final Brexit deal without having approved crucial legislation, such as the immigration bill, and would be voting blind.The prime minister has promised the UK parliament will be the first to ratify the deal, before it goes to the EU parliament and the other 27 states, though the timeline may slip.Last June, May said this parliament would be a “busy legislative session.” In total, the government has only passed four bills from last year’s Queen’s speech. By comparison, the 2010 coalition government had passed twice as many laws at this stage of the parliament. The general election delivered a hung parliament, leaving May able to pass bills only with the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party and dependent on the discipline of Conservative MPs. In December, pro-EU Tory MPs defeated the government to guarantee parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal. The Lords is currently debating the bill and may yet inflict another defeat on the government by passing an amendment to keep the UK in a customs arrangement with the EU. The amendment, sponsored by former Conservative party chair Lord Patten, calls for the government to negotiate an arrangement “which enables the United Kingdom to continue participating in a customs union with the EU”.Several other key pieces of legislation have been delayed, in part because of concerns about the possibility of Conservative rebellions.Chapman said MPs may be expected to vote on the final Brexit deal before they have even had the chance to scrutinise important details such as the government’s immigration plan. “Take back control didn’t mean running away from parliament,” she said. “It’s frankly embarrassing that, more than 10 months since the general election, the government hasn’t passed a single piece of Brexit legislation. Ministers have delayed crucial votes and failed to introduce vital bills.”MPs have not voted on Brexit in more than two months, while crucial votes on the customs bill and trade bill have been delayed for more than two months – and are now not expected until after the local elections next month.Conservative MPs in favour of a soft Brexit, including two of the party’s select committee chairmen and three former ministers, have put their name to amendments that would force the prime minister to put Britain’s membership of a customs union back on the negotiating table. Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour’s policy is to support such an arrangement, raising concerns in No 10 that May could be defeated on a key plank of her Brexit strategy. However, it remains unclear whether the Tory MPs behind the amendment would go as far as pushing for a vote if there was a real possibility of fatally undermining the prime minister. A government spokesperson said: “Brexit is an issue of national importance and clearly it is important that parliament is given the proper opportunity to scrutinise the legislation that will underpin it. “We are making good progress and we are confident that we can pass the necessary legislation in good time. For example, the EU (withdrawal) bill has already moved through the Commons and is now at report stage in the Lords while the nuclear safeguards bill and sanctions and anti-money laundering bill have made good progress through both Houses.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ae682279b59792add2e5ea91fad9300712af79e/94_52_3362_2018/master/3362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6d3b87ee9722ebfe2d2f295dc2fff657 1240w","title":"brexit weekly briefing launch of the campaign for a peoples vote","story":"Cross-party grouping is seeking what it carefully avoids calling a second referendumWelcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing.

We do it because we believe our perspective matters and it may be your perspective, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian Supporter. Thank you.With Westminster and Brussels on holiday, there weren’t many. But as the UK and EU gear up for their first discussion this week on the future relationship, MPs from the four main parties in Britain launched a push for a “people’s vote” on the final deal. Carefully avoiding the term “second referendum”, the cross-party lineup included the Conservatives’ Anna Soubry, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran and Chuka Umunna, who urged his Labour party to be “true to its values and support this”. Whether the proposition can win a majority in the House of Commons is unclear. But pressure on the government to secure a sensible final deal mounted, with the Institute of Directors bluntly urging it to maintain close ties with the EU after Brexit.The IoD said trade with the EU and the rest of the world would have to be boosted to fulfil ministers’ “global Britain” ambitions, with the EU currently providing stronger growth for UK firms selling overseas than Asia or North America.  A warning of what might be in store if the government gets it wrong came from Jaguar Land Rover, which announced it was cutting 1,000 jobs owing to Brexit “headwinds” – while Ireland reiterated its regular reminder of trouble ahead. The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, warned that the withdrawal treaty and the transition agreement would both be at risk as early as June unless Britain came up with an acceptable wording as a “backstop” solution to the Irish border question in the event of no deal.In the Guardian, Hugo Dixon argues that Brexit is looking bad on all fronts, which is why there should be a people’s vote on the final deal:Quitting the EU will affect us for generations to come. It will impact jobs, the NHS, the environment, our ability to stand up to bullies across the world, our pride and even the unity of the United Kingdom. A good deal would be good for our public services, prosperity, power and peace. But as new facts emerge, it is clear Brexit will fail on all counts. The leave campaign’s slogan was “take back control”. This is a bad joke. As Theresa May makes one climbdown after another in the Brexit talks, it’s clear we are losing control. This is because we need the EU more than it needs us – exactly the opposite of what Johnson, Gove and co promised two years ago. This tail-between-our-legs Brexit will be bad for our pride and bad for our power. We’ll have less clout on the global stage too. At a time when Russia is flexing its muscles, is it really sensible to burn our bridges with Europe? Brexiters will, no doubt, seek to trash the idea of a people’s vote by calling it a second referendum. It’s not. In 2016, voters had a choice between the reality of staying in the EU and the fantasy promised by the leave campaign. Once we know what the deal is, we will be able to compare two realities. That’s not undemocratic. It’s common sense.In the New Statesman, George Eaton argues that public opinion remains too ambiguous for most MPs to back a new vote: The Home Office “hostile environment” inflicted on Windrush-era citizens from the Caribbean could bode ill for EU nationals in the UK:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bc02900b1907fcbf61529ccd20eb0562d42af86/1050_116_1288_773/master/1288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c6bd69b46164f4ed104bd27e5d5228e5 1240w","title":"ben stokes ipl t20 england cricket joe root captain","story":"It’s 6pm at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore. A drowsy sun has already slunk below the stands, kites glide overhead and after three hours of intense training in the heat, where he has batted twice, thundered in with the ball for the first time in weeks and stayed late to work on his flying boundary catches, Ben Stokes strolls over for a chat.There is of course one almighty elephant in the ground. We both briefly acknowledge this but it remains just that. This is his first in-depth interview since the incident in Bristol on 25\u0026nbspSeptember last year but regarding events that night Stokes must wait to have his say in court this summer after he and two other men pleaded not guilty to affray. For now it is only cricket, both England and Indian Premier League, that can be on the agenda in the Garden City.The Indian Premier League first, where the 26-year-old is in his second season and at his second side, Rajasthan Royals. Eoin Morgan, one of his two international captains, has recently credited the all-rounder’s MVP-winning stint with the runners-up Rising Pune Supergiant last year for “breaking down barriers” and causing the English invasion that has a record 12\u0026nbspplayers spread across six of the eight franchises.Stokes appreciates their presence in Twenty20’s great tamasha, rather than with their counties, is not to everyone’s taste back home. The subject of his £1.7m deal with Pune last year – a record for an overseas player – and new price tag at just a shade under, is one at which he squirms. “Last year there was so much said about me and the money. I just shy away from it. I don’t want to come across as arrogant. I don’t know how to answer it. It’s just weird,” he says.Stokes is clearly enjoying his time with the Royals. The inaugural IPL winners in 2008, they are now trying to rebuild public trust in their first season back as the result of a two-year ban for the spot-fixing scandal that cost three players their careers. He has struck up a particular rapport with Shane Warne, the team’s mentor, while Jos Buttler is a familiar face in the ranks. But as is the case with England, all team‑mates tend to gravitate towards him.His only off-field struggle in India has come from some of the commercial demands that pack out the schedule on non-match days. “They ask you to do things that are so far out of your comfort zone – it’s just not me,” he says, perhaps in reference to some lively Bollywood-style dancing of his that can be witnessed during the IPL’s numerous TV ad breaks.The feet are moving better on the field even if the returns do not yet jump off the page. His third match against Royal Challengers Bangalore – a high-scoring 19-run win on the day after the interview – is the most impactful yet, with a 21-ball 27 from No\u0026nbsp4, his first wicket of the campaign and a leaping boundary catch to remove Brendon McCullum that kickstarted the RCB struggle in their pursuit of 218.While the latter was a classic case of Stokes making the ridiculous look sublimely simple – his extra training 24 hours earlier leapt to mind as he sprung high – it is likely the bowling will have given Stokes most satisfaction, purely for the fact he was charging in at full tilt for the first time in a long time.A pre-Christmas spell in New Zealand with Canterbury notwithstanding, the general lack of action leading into his return for England in February had affected his body. Bowling in the one-day series saw wickets follow but he found his legs seized up after spells. Then, just before the Tests that followed, some historical stress fractures in his lower back suddenly began to cause him grief and injections were required.Just 10 laboured overs were sent down in the two Tests that followed the jabs but Stokes says he is feeling himself again to prevent a recurrence he is remodelling his bowling action. The late step into the crease that pointed him to fine leg and left him needing to twist in order to straighten up is being eased out. He is happy with the results but the true test is in the middle.The return to the England camp – he has been restored to the side until the end of proceedings – was probably as smooth as he and his employers could have hoped. Stokes says the squad’s response felt no different to before from his perspective – “it’s not like we hadn’t stayed in touch” – but admits watching his Test colleagues among them go down 4-0 in Australia was tough. “I lived every moment of the Ashes. I’m sure it was nowhere near the emotions of the guys out there but I was just as gutted.”Readjustment batting-wise took little time either, with one low-key score of 12 in the first one-dayer at Hamilton – “I was anxious. I was guilty of thinking too far ahead and trying to make an impression. It was like I was at the start of my career,” – before a less flustered unbeaten 63 steered Morgan’s side to a series‑levelling win at Mount\u0026nbspMaunganui.“I was really emotional after getting man of the match in that second game back. It was such a relief to perform and be there at the end. I had five minutes to myself after getting back to the dressing room, sat in my bubble and taking it all in. The lads appreciated that and gave me space. It was a great feeling.”“It’s all about what I’m going to do in the future. I just want to get us back to playing the way we want to play. We were so close to being one of the best teams in the world. We’ve slacked off in the past two years but knowing how close we were gives you that desire to get back there.”That slacking off, as he puts it, bottomed out with the 58 all out in Auckland – “It was like the pins in a bowling alley falling down in slow motion” – from which a 1-0 series defeat followed. From being one Test win away from holding all nine bilateral Test trophies in 2016, only for Pakistan to win at the Oval and square the series, England have five in the cabinet to match their world ranking of fifth.Root, Bayliss and the as-yet reformed selection panel have a job on their hands. The former is battling to turn half-centuries into three figures, too – his last nine have gone unconverted – and it is a topic Stokes has been discussing with one of his new friends in India.“But the thing about Joe is he doesn’t bat for himself. If he thinks it is time to take a team down, he will go for it. That’s how he wants us to play as a team and as captain, he feels he has to set the standard. People can have a go at him but the bigger picture, that’s what he is trying to build. When it clicks – and that is coming – those scores will become 150s and 200s. Hopefully when people read what I have said here they will understand a\u0026nbspbit\u0026nbspmore.”Doubtless much of the heat from the end of England’s sorry Test travails this winter was drawn by Australia’s ball-tampering scandal and before Stokes heads up to the dressing room at the Chinnaswamy, before his new team’s departure from the ground, his views on the topic are sought.“I’m keeping my mouth shut. Certain people said some things and it then comes back to get you\u0026nbsp…” he says, before stopping himself from elaborating on who and what he means. Given the aforementioned elephant, it is probably for the best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5974e54e22510bc0c5db1aaed8016c0dbbcc0205/218_225_4659_2796/master/4659.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7ce3618633b1cdc369384e7207c4141d 1240w","title":"gold coast commonwealth games finale birmingham 2022","story":"The organisers of Birmingham 2022, possibly daunted by following an event so well received on the ground, may have felt some relief as the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games ended on a bum note.Furious spectators and even the host broadcaster condemned a closing ceremony that barely paid a passing mention to the athletes. Usain Bolt, paid to be here by a telecommunications company and still the biggest draw even eight months into retirement, was on the DJ decks and a Kylie Minogue impersonator featured.But the athletes had already been seated before the show began, an outrage which reached the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. “I’m just as disappointed as anyone else,” she said. “We wanted to stand there and celebrate our athletes and it didn’t happen. Whoever was responsible for making that decision should hang their head in shame.”A mea culpa followed from the Commonwealth Games chairman, Peter Beattie. “We wanted to get the athletes in early but we made a serious error of judgment by not having them in the broadcast,” he said. “It was driven by concerns about the welfare of athletes but they should have been involved. There were too many speeches, I shouldn’t have spoken because it bored the athletes silly.”A potentially more serious oversight unfolded on the marathon course when the Scottish runner Callum Hawkins collapsed with heat exhaustion and was left on the road for several minutes without medical attention as spectators snapped selfies. He was released from hospital on Monday.These were rare errors from an organising committee which delivered 11 days of slick operations, mostly full stadiums and a notable absence of traffic jams, helped by the exodus of locals scared off before the Games began by regular warnings of impending chaos.Where Birmingham could struggle to compete is with the stunning vistas, particularly the sandy beaches and turquoise waters that provided the backdrop to the open-air aquatics centre and the volleyball stadium. The venues for the gymnastics, cycling and netball were sold out for almost every session, pumping with music and entertaining sport.The only disappointment was that many of England’s leading names failed to perform. The Brownlee brothers arrived slightly injured and left without medals. Max Whitlock was outshone on the pommel horse by the 17-year-old Rhys McClenaghan from Northern Ireland. The world indoor champion hurdler Andrew Pozzi and the Olympic medallist hammer thrower Sophie Hitchon faltered, and Adam Peaty was beaten in the pool for the first time in four years.But at least they showed up. Bolt was bemused that some of England’s best sprinters, including CJ Ujah, who had every chance of winning a 100m medal, did not travel. Sebastian Coe, the president of athletics’ governing body the IAAF, was also surprised. “My gut instinct is try to not sit out championships because they are important at the end of your career,” he said. “When you turn your cards over it’s medals that people judge you on, not fast times in the Diamond League.”These Games will be recalled in England not for the medal table but for the netball team, who provided the most thrilling and unexpected result by beating Australia. The tales of perseverance and triumph against the odds also cut through. The weightlifter Zoe Smith, who has battled injury, funding cuts and worked as a waitress between training, won silver, just days after having an epidural to ease agonising pain.No stranger to heartache was the 400m hurdler Kyron McMaster of the British Virgin Islands, who won gold only months after his coach was killed by Hurricane Irma.Tom Daley produced a performance which will live longer in the memory than any perfectly executed back 3½ pike. “There are 37 countries in the Commonwealth where it’s illegal to be who I am hopefully we can reduce that number,” he said, calling on the 37 of the 53 countries where homosexuality is illegal to change their laws.Given that number was 43 four years ago in Glasgow, it is not a hopeless plea. Where other sporting bodies scarper at the mere mention of politics, the Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive, David Grevemberg, actively promotes discussion of human-rights issues.The Rwanda women’s beach volleyball team were encouraged to wear black armbands to mark the 24th anniversary of the genocide, while Australia’s indigenous culture, which it still wrestles with, was a major part of the opening ceremony.The question which pervades every Commonwealth Games is “do they really matter?” From a sporting perspective it is impossible to argue they compare with the Olympics or a world championships. But the Games has shown once again that they offer something wholly, often wonderfully, different."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/531460b1fa9d58dd6bedfc3e28a45a3bfd673ae7/6_281_5052_3031/master/5052.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bd30a972b65e455ff0f6bd798e6fe9f5 1240w","title":"wayne pivac scarlets welsh rugby champions cup semi final leinster","story":"The storming run to a European Champions Cup semi-final against Leinster has reunited a proud rugby town and brought the fans flooding backAfter the Scarlets had beaten La Rochelle last month to reach their first European Cup semi-final for 11 years, Phil Bennett closed his eyes and was transported back to Stradey Park, the ramshackle, resonant ground where he had made his name as a fly-half from the end of the 1960s when Carwyn James coached Llanelli, where style mattered as much as winning.The Scarlets moved out of Stradey in 2008 and the ground was turned into a housing estate. Their new stadium held 4,000 more spectators but it was rarely more than half full. “Some people never made the move here,” says Bennett, sitting in a café-bar at Parc y Scarlets that is open every weekday. “It took time to work but the region has never been in a healthier position: the kids, the lifeblood of any club, are coming back.“A team ingrains itself in your soul when you are young. My father took me to Stradey Park when I was a small boy. I watched giants of the game and became a Scarlet forever. I still savour those days and matches I played there, not least the victory over the 1972 All Blacks, but we can move on now. The crowd stayed in their seats for some 15 minutes after the La Rochelle game, singing songs and applauding the players. Big men broke down. Parc y Scarlets was born.”The Scarlets face Leinster in Dublin on Saturday in their fourth European Cup semi-final. Like Bennett, the region’s Wales wing Steff Evans was taken to Stradey Park as a young boy and fell in love with his hometown club. “When I was growing up, all youngsters wanted to do was play for the Scarlets,” he says.“That is coming back, as you will hear if you go to any school in the area. I have never known a buzz about the town as there has been in the last few months. People are talking not just about the old days but a new era. It was not long ago that we were playing before small crowds because the rugby was not there, but thousands of supporters will be in Dublin and every week is a final for us.”Bennett credits a New Zealander with the revival: Wayne Pivac, a former policeman and Auckland head coach who arrived in Llanelli in 2014 as forwards coach, put in charge six months later. “The history of this place is not lost on me and it was a reason I came here,” says Pivac. “So was the expansive game they play but it took a time to turn things around. Finance had a bit to do with it but, to be brutal, the environment was not that honest. Now no short cuts are being taken by anyone: we spend so much time together it has to be a home away from home. Everyone is treated the same: we mix old-fashioned values with good practices of the modern game. We are in it together.”Pivac consulted a number of people who had coached in Wales before joining the Scarlets and received conflicting advice about whether to live locally or commute from Cardiff and avoid the goldfish bowl. “I live in Llanelli, by the beach,” he says. “People here are not shy and I chat to them in the supermarket, the petrol station, wherever. They have a passion for rugby and know a lot about it. No one has been rude. I do not hide away and prefer to update supporters rather than have rumours flying about. I have the same approach with the media. I am really enjoying living in Wales and feel part of the rugby fabric.”To JJ Williams, who was part of the Llanelli side that defeated the All Blacks, Pivac is a contender to take over from Warren Gatland as Wales’s head coach after next year’s World Cup. “I used to think there was no heart and soul in regional rugby,” the former Wales and Lions wing says. “It is coming: the Scarlets are playing a good brand of rugby and so are Cardiff Blues, who have made the Challenge Cup semi-finals.“The Scarlets are showing what can be achieved on a relatively small budget: I admire what the English clubs have achieved in growing the game there, but the rugby is not great in the Premiership. Supporters in Wales are more discerning: they want to be entertained and the Scarlets are doing that. Wales could do a lot worse than Wayne Pivac.”The Welsh Rugby Union, which has drawn up a shortlist of three to succeed Gatland, has spoken to Pivac. “They sounded me out over a coffee and I assume they have done that with all the regional coaches,” he says. “There has been nothing formal and it is about how they see the future. I have signed on for another two years at the Scarlets, as have the other coaches here, and we enjoy what we are doing.“Having 10 Scarlets in the Wales side that beat Scotland showed we are contributing to the game. We played some sublime rugby in the play-offs last season, but you cannot just throw the ball around. You have to have a platform and the way we fronted up at forward against La Rochelle and before them Toulon showed the character and determination of this group.”The Scarlets are underdogs in Dublin, but they have been since losing their opening two pool matches and being within two minutes of going down to Treviso in the third. They finished by running Bath off the Recreation Ground and not flinching against Toulon’s muscle. “Bath supporters came up to me at the end and said they had not seen rugby like that for a long time,” says Bennett.“I used to help with the marketing here but now the game the team is playing is selling itself. This is our breakthrough season. The emotion is back, we’re still here and Parc y Scarlets is our home now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81d855f5ac38ba3d942b151029453c9067a44e3d/0_651_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=07f801cf5f156543799230008803a687 1240w","title":"talking horses best bets for day one of newmarkets craven meeting","story":"Josephine Gordon is on an interesting 10-1 shot at British Flat racing’s HQ as fast horses return to our screensThree days after the world’s most famous steeplechase, racing performs a screeching handbrake turn and shoots off down the Rowley Mile for some Flat racing, the first of any significance on British turf for about half a year. Even as a diehard jumps fan, I feel no resentment about this it’s time to see something that can move at speed, to freshen up the palate ahead of the Charlie Hall.Whether today’s runners at Newmarket can actually move at speed is something we’ll only learn for sure when the racing starts. After plenty of recent rain, the going is good to soft but drying conditions are due all week and I think we’ll see some visible acceleration by Thursday at the latest. I’m afraid Robero, my NB, has become a non-runner so the interesting one for me on this card is Arzaak (5.55) in the last. Chris Dwyer’s sprint handicapper has shortened to 10-1 from an opening 20s. His recent all-weather record has been just OK but at least it will have sharpened him up and he was running to a much higher level on the turf last summer. He’s slipped to a mark just below the one from which he scored at Catterick in May and seems to cope well with both fast turf and soft. There’s still some juice in his price.I’m not breaking any secrets when I suggest that John Gosden is a good man to follow this week, while we wait for more clues about which stables are flying and which need more time. He’s had five winners from 11 runners in the past fortnight and has, in my memory, been a predictable source of winners at recent Craven meetings. He’s had the winner of the Alex Scott Maiden three times in the past four years. This time, the race has been ided and his Jawwaal (2.25) is the one that grabs me in the second ision at odds of 7-2. He ran third in a couple of decent maidens last summer, at Newmarket and Newbury, being green on the first occasion but travelling sweetly for a long way next time. We can hope for a significant step forward this time and I’d rather have him than the favourite, History Writer, whose one run was respectable but who comes from a smaller Sussex yard that has yet to get a win on the board this year.The nap is Choix Des Armes (3.45) at Exeter, where Paul Nicholls’s charge carries a penalty in a handicap hurdle. He appears to have had one or two issues but bolted up on his handicap debut at Wincanton and really ought to do so again at 11-10 or thereabouts. Popular veteran Cue Card has been retired, assistant trainer Joe Tizzard has announced.

Fourteen years later I see how wrong we were Fourteen years, two months, and eight days ago, I made a mistake. Like a lot of mistakes made at the age of 20 inside a college dorm room, it involved trusting a man I shouldn’t have, and it still affects me to this day.No, Mark Zuckerberg didn’t give me herpes. But in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, I have been thinking back to my decision to sign up for thefacebook.com on the site’s fifth day in existence, and I am struck by the parallels between Zuckerberg’s creation and a pesky (if generally benign) virus. Facebook isn’t going to kill me, but it has wormed its way into all of my relationships, caused me to infect other people, and I will never, ever be fully rid of it. Last week, Zuckerberg was called to answer for himself. Over the course of two days of questioning before Congress, Zuckerberg sought to assure the public that we, not he, are in “complete control” of our relationships with Facebook. He repeated this guarantee dozens of times, returning again and again to the idea that users can control their Facebook data.But the Zuckerberg of 2018 sounds suspiciously like the “Mark E Zuckerberg ’06” who was interviewed by the Harvard Crimson on 9 February 2004 about his brand new website. It was this article that prompted my roommates and I to start entrusting a stranger behind a computer screen with the keys to our identities: names, birthdates, photographs, email addresses, and more. “There are pretty intensive privacy options,” he told the paper. “People have very good control over who can see their information.” “On Facebook, everything that you share there you have control over,” he told Senator Dean Heller just moments after failing to give a straight answer on whether Facebook has ever collected the contents of its users phone calls. “You can say I don’t want this information to be there. You have full access to understand all, every piece of information that Facebook might know about you, and you can get rid of all of it.”Zuckerberg was lying then and he’s lying now. We do not have “complete control” and we never have, as evidenced by the fact that even people who never signed up for Facebook have “shadow profiles” created without their consent. He has been getting away with this same spin for 14 years, two months, and eight days. Watching him dissemble in front of Congress, I couldn’t help but see him as one of those fresh-faced boys at Harvard who transitioned seamlessly from their New England prep schools to the Ivy League, and excelled at maintaining steady eye contact with the professor while they opined about books they hadn’t read.I can still remember our excitement and curiosity for the new website that promised to enhance and replace the physical facebooks that Harvard passed out to first-year students. Those thin, hardcover volumes were a frequent source of useful information and prurient entertainment. We used to pore over the book, trying to figure out the name of this guy from class, or that girl from Saturday night, judging the looks of other students and generally indulging in a kind of pre-cyber cyber-stalking: it was a way to learn things about other people without having to ask them directly. Zuckerberg’s website broke the facebook out of its bindings. During those first weeks and months, we bore witness to Facebook’s power to reorient social interactions. With Facebook, you were friends, or not friends in a relationship, single, or “it’s complicated” popularity was easily quantifiable those who chose not to sign up for Facebook were defining themselves as abstainers, whether they wanted to or not. All of the beautiful and painful mess of human interactions was reducible to a data point in the social graph.We embraced this recalibration of social relations without thinking about who or what was behind them. Judging strangers based on their facebook photo transitioned seamlessly into judging people based on their Facebook profile and Facebook habits. It’s embarrassing to remember now my own decision, born of a hefty sense of my own too-coolness, that I would only ever respond to other people’s friend requests, and not send any myself, as if this were a meaningful form of self-definition. I’d like to think that I spared a thought for the motivations of the man behind the computer screen, but I’m sure I didn’t. Even if I had thought to assign a word, let alone a value, to the idea that I should maintain control over the pieces of information by which others would come to know and judge me – “privacy”, I think we call this – I probably would have been taken in by Zuckerberg’s assurances in that first Crimson article that his website was perfectly safe.The truth is that Facebook’s great value has come from making the rest of us lose control. Yes, we can decide what photos and status updates and biographical details we plug into Facebook’s gaping maw. But the most valuable insights have been gleaned from the things we didn’t even realize we were giving away. Facebook knows what I read on the internet, where I want to go on vacation, how late I stay up at night, whose posts I scroll quickly by, and whose posts I pause to linger over. It knows that I took reporting trips to Montana and Seattle and San Diego, despite the fact that I have never allowed it to track me by GPS. It knows my father’s cell phone number, despite the fact that he has never signed up for its service, because I was stupid enough to share my contacts with it once, several years ago. It knows all of these things that are, in my opinion, none of its goddamn business. If I’ve learned one thing from Mark Zuckerberg it’s that the most valuable knowledge about another person comes from learning things about them that they wouldn’t tell you themselves.So here’s what I know about Mark Zuckerberg. During those first few weeks of Facebook’s existence, while he was assuring his fellow college students that we could trust him with their identities, he had a private conversation on instant messenger with a friend. That conversation was subsequently leaked, and published by Silicon Valley Insider. It is as follows: ZUCK: yea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvardZUCK: just askZUCK: i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, snsFRIEND: what!? how’d you manage that one?ZUCK: people just submitted itZUCK: i don’t know whyZUCK: they “trust me”In the intervening years, I’ve learned that Zuckerberg values his own privacy so much that he has security guards watching his trash, that he bought four houses surrounding his own house to avoid having neighbors, that he sued hundreds of Hawaiians to sever their claim to tiny plots of land within his massive Kauai estate, and that he secretly built tools to prevent further private messages from coming back to haunt him. What I haven’t learned, or seen any sign of, is that he has changed his opinion of the intelligence of his users. It’s Zuckerberg’s world, and we’re all just a bunch of dumb fucks living in it.

Last month a teenage boy was given a £5,000 cruise in exchange for his Snapchat username while accounts on Instagram are sold openly on online marketplaces. Shady brokers stalk the web searching for the most potentially lucrative handles, convincing their owners to part with them before reselling at a significantly higher price.“It’s funny some people don’t know the true value of a handle,” says another trader on condition of anonymity. “For example, I used to look for three-letter acronyms. The handle would generally go for around $30 but little do they know people look for specific @’s correlating with their business. I’ve flipped $20-$40 to $700 on multiple occasions.”Elsewhere, people allege their accounts have been phished, and their handles stolen and sold, yet Twitter has apparently not implemented robust systems to prevent the practice.“Twitter has yet to go after the hackers or phishers, let alone the legitimate account sellers, like myself,” says Philly. “Phishing an account is as easy as downloading an infected program, ticking a couple options and hitting run.”“They used social engineering strategies with multiple other services and sites (like Amazon),” says Josh Bryant, a designer at a digital product firm, who documented how he almost lost his handle in a blog post.“The why is just money. I own both @jb on Twitter and Instagram and there’s a huge economy for desirable usernames right now. If a hacker can get them, list and sell them before the site responds they stand to make a pretty healthy profit.”Another user claims their username was taken by Twitter itself. “A broker kept approaching me, and when I declined his final offer, a formal complaint was made to Twitter, by whom I don’t know, and the handle was handed over to JPMorgan,” says Chase Giunta, a software developer who previously owned the handle @Chase.“I always assumed JP Morgan would want it since they’re the largest bank in the US, but I also assumed they, or maybe even Twitter, would contact me directly to set up some kind of exchange – not some shady broker.”Twitter, however, does not permit the trading of usernames. It explicitly states: “Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for usernames are also violations and may result in permanent account suspension.” This does not seem to have stopped them changing hands, though.“After his last offer, I received action from Twitter,” says Giunta. “The steps they took to take my account down were incredibly unsettling. They sent me automated emails claiming I was impersonating Chase Bank, which I wasn’t, before they took the username from me.”“Of course, in hindsight, I would’ve accepted his last $20,000 offer. But I thought I was doing the ‘right thing’ by turning it down at that time.”This sentiment was echoed by Patrick de Laive, the founder of The Next Web, who was offered $20,000 for @patrick by an athlete.Accounts may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity to prevent handle squatting. In the early days of the social media giant, this meant people could contact the administrator and request inactive handles.A former Twitter employee told the Guardian how they could request unused usernames for themselves and family. Others have since demonstrated the relative ease in which enterprising people can secure their desired handle.“I got my first name as my Twitter handle after a six-month campaign that included some light Internet stalking, badgering staff at Twitter, $250 and a visit to the patent office,” says Haje Jan, a director at Bold, a venture capitalist company, whose first name was taken by an inactive user.“I registered a web domain for my first name to strengthen my case (in case the trademark people decided to look any deeper), then forked over my £170 to the Intellectual Property Office, registering Haje™ as a trademark.”“Armed with the trademark I contacted Twitter’s support team and about a week later, I received an email saying that I could either create a new account or move the username to an existing account. Mission accomplished – and it turned out to be easier than I anticipated.”It’s not just iniduals who have bought up desirable usernames. The state of Israel bought the @israel handle for reported six-figure sum in 2010, while CNN employed the owner of @cnnbrk as a consultant in exchange for transferring them the account.“Twitter has always been very clear that it’s against their terms and conditions to sell usernames but that hasn’t stopped people trying,” says Sue Llewellyn, who trains journalists to use social media. “They also frown upon people squatting on usernames – ie creating an account and not using it.”“Frankly I think if a big name celebrity wanted a specific name that wasn’t being used then they could probably get it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c25b4e7acf0f280489b9b6984bb47ccc789ea84f/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ef90e397d5b599251cb0ed5381708aa1 1240w","title":"tesla halts model 3 electric car production improve automation","story":"Firm struggles to hit targets for mass-market electric car after reeling from excessive automation and mounting pressureTesla has temporarily suspended its Model 3 assembly line as Elon Musk’s electric car firm struggles to deliver on targets.The company said the move was a planned production pause of up to five days. It is the second time since February that Tesla has halted its production line for the Model 3 at its Fremont, California plant.“These periods are used to improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks in order to increase production rates,” said a Tesla spokesperson.The shutdown took Tesla staff at the plant by surprise, forcing them to use vacation days or stay at home without pay, according to reports from BuzzFeed.Tesla suspended production of its Model 3 for four days in February in what the company said was planned work to improve automation and address bottlenecks. It warned of possibly more periods of downtime in coming months.Car manufacturers typically stop or slow production of new models when ironing out problems with production. Tesla took shortcuts with testing of its production line in order to get to market more quickly, which some experts say have resulted in early manufacturing problems.Musk recently admitted that “excessive automation” at the Tesla plant had contributed to what he calls “manufacturing hell” and had actually slowed down manufacturing of the crucial mass-market model.“We had this crazy, complex network of conveyor belts … And it was not working, so we got rid of that whole thing,” Musk told CBS.The electric car firm has repeatedly missed targets and is now trying to reach a production volume of 2,500 vehicles per week. Musk recently said Tesla was managing to make 2,000 Model 3s a week, but failed to assuage doubts about the company reaching its 5,000-a-week target in three months time.Musk tweeted on Friday that Tesla would be profitable and cash flow positive in the third and fourth quarters, with no need to raise money.Many analysts dispute this analysis, which hinges on a rapid rise in production of the Model 3 sedan. Delays and lower-than-expected volume have postponed revenue from cars being delivered to customers from reaching Tesla’s bottom line."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

So, take a seat in the mighty arena alongside 12,000 spectators (togas optional)The first gladiator is down, flailing his gladius towards the emperor before being pummelled by a giant hammer (thankfully, into a furrow of sand left by one of the racing chariots). Two “slaves” rush on and drag his body off towards the spoliarium. Suddenly, everyone is up out of their seats: the retiarius (net man) has dropped his trident and the mirmillones (fish men) are closing in.Nîmes’ Les Grands Jeux Romains (Great Roman Games) is one of the biggest re-enactment spectaculars in Europe. Sitting among 12,000 handkerchief-waving spectators in the city’s first-century Roman amphitheatre last year, I realised it makes for a mesmerising and charmingly-brutal event. Having already featured Hannibal (2015), Cleopatra (2016) and, last year, Boudicca, this year’s games, which take place from 28-30 April, is devoted to Spartacus.“The first Great Roman Games was held in Nîmes in 2010 with little publicity,” says Valérie Espin, in charge of the games’ organisation company, Culturespaces. “The idea was just to have some chariots parading around the arena and people dressed up as Romans. But it has captured the public’s imagination and now there is a cast of 500 performing in front of 32,000 spectators over three days.”In the corner of Espin’s office is a giant scutum (curved Roman shield) and on top of her filing cabinet, a pair of gladiator helmets. “Participants take it very seriously,” she says. “Most of the re-enactors meet weekly, dress up as Romans and spend the weekend on camps, training for battles, preparing Roman food, testing equipment and living as Romans.”This year there are 28 different Roman associations taking part: 11 from France, 16 from Italy, one from Croatia and, for the first time, a group from Britain, Legio Secunda Augusta.“Seven of us are going to Nîmes from our gladiator group based in Portsmouth,” says dental nurse and weekend gladiatrix, Alisa Vanlint. “All the names we use are authentic the Second Augustus Legion was based in Britain for a while.”It’s also the first time female gladiators will fight at the games. “I am Achillia and will be fighting Amazonia – the names come from a marble relief in the British Museum.”Vanlint teaches stage combat and also re-enacts medieval and “1805” battles but her favourite is Roman. “I love sharing an amazing piece of history.” She will appear in the oval arena straight after the horse chases and then as a slave in Spartacus’s army in the second part of the show. Other members of Legio Secunda Augusta are soldiers and civilians.“The helmets are heavy but once you’re fighting, the adrenalin kicks in and the longer you wear it the easier it becomes. I don’t notice it after a while, it’s the same with cuts and bruises,” says Vanlint.Outside the arena, the city’s street’s will also be hectic with Roman revelry. There’s a Roman market selling asses’ milk cosmetics, oil, grapejuice and honey followed by a night-time parade with flaming torches. A Roman galley is on the esplanade and local restaurants will serve Roman-style food, while children solve clues in a treasure-hunt-enigma game.Restoration of the arena will continue for another 12 years. “Repairs of the terraces have given us another 130 seats this year,” says Espin. “Many of the local buildings contain stones looted from the amphitheatre and replacements come from the same Nîmes quarries as they did in Roman times.Besides the arcaded amphitheatre, Nîmes also has the Maison Carrée temple and the Tour Magne. All three can be visited on a combined ticket (€13 adult, €11 child, family ticket €40). Nîmes’ will also see its spectacular new Musée de la Romanité open on 2 June, with 3,500 square metres of multimedia exhibition space dedicated to Roman mosaics, sculptures and everyday objects. Its first exhibition, Gladiators: Heroes of the Colosseum, runs until 24 September 2018.There are also the ruins of the Temple of Diana, as well as two Roman city gates and the Castellum that collected water carried in from Uzès across the Pont du Gard viaduct.• Adult from €15, child from €5, Les Grands Jeux Romains, 28-30 April, arenes-nimes.com"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59221629a955ac31157ebfca07459a99a98b0dc/0_125_1532_1260/master/1532.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=414e0a55a9d5b21139f2360261fedcf9 1240w","title":"aubrey plaza legion interview weird exhausting not being human","story":"How do you play a gender-fluid psychotic figment of a mutant’s imagination? The star of the superhero psychodrama reveals all – and explains why her friends can’t watch itAubrey Plaza finds it hard to describe her character in the TV superhero drama Legion. Is she alive or dead? Good or evil? Human or mutant? Real or a figment of the lead character, mutant David Haller’s imagination? “That’s a really, really good question,” says Plaza, before saying that Lenny Busker began as a human woman, then became trapped in a dimension of Haller’s mind, and has now been stranded by the evil Shadow King on the “astral plane”. It’s “a total mindfuck”, says Plaza. “It’s mentally and physically exhausting to not exist as a human. At the end of the day I would just feel like nothing, just this rag doll that’s been thrown around.”Legion’s strangeness might be stifling, but the 33-year-old has long specialised in disconcerting kooks. She is best known for playing April Ludgate in Parks and Recreation, a sardonic and contrarian member of the low-level local government department who spends her days spouting morbid soundbites and making people feel uncomfortable. It was a part written especially for her after a casting director told the show’s co-creator Michael Schur that she had met “the weirdest girl” and he should work her into the sitcom.Soon, it would become obvious to everyone that Plaza’s strangeness wasn’t confined to the screen. In 2013, for reasons she would later refuse to explain, she stormed the stage at the MTV Movie awards and attempted to wrestle Will Ferrell’s award from his hands. On YouTube, people began making compilations of her eye-wateringly awkward chatshow appearances, characterised by eerily deadpan jokes and a thousand-yard stare. Plaza’s oddball shtick has been convincing enough to earn her some high-profile gigs: over the past decade she’s brought her singular sensibility to a swath of comedies, from Judd Apatow’s Funny People to the frankly alarming Robert De Niro vehicle Dirty Grandpa. Last year, however, Plaza took her eccentric persona to new dramatic heights in the comedy-drama Ingrid Goes West, which she also produced. As Ingrid, a lost and lonely young woman who obsesses over and eventually infiltrates the life of an Instagram influencer, Plaza was both peculiarly amusing and hauntingly sad.Ingrid Goes West is a brilliant distillation of the compulsion and deceit hardwired into platforms like Instagram for Plaza, it was a message that really hit home. “In Ingrid, you have someone who already has enough trouble having normal healthy relationships, then you give them a device that lets them play out their most toxic impulses,” she says over the phone from her home in Los Angeles. “And I think on a smaller scale that’s what’s happening with everyone on social media.”Plaza briefly deleted her Twitter account in 2016, signing off with the message: “Dear Twitter it’s been fun but I’ve realized you are wrong for me and maybe the world.” She explains that she has “such a hard time” with social media. “Most of the time it just makes me feel bad. I know the feeling of being scared not to engage with social media because you feel like ‘I’m going to lose these connections and lose this awareness of myself’, but it’s all bullshit. I haven’t been on Facebook in over 10 years. It’s changed nothing in my life, I don’t think about it at all.”Though it’s adapted from a Marvel comic, Legion, which returns for its second series this week, certainly isn’t your average superhero fare. With Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley at the helm, it’s set in a retro-futurist 1960s universe, and spends less time on deafening fight scenes and more on goofy dance routines. Another thing that differentiates Legion from the rest of the Marvel universe is its depiction of mental illness. Haller, played by Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens, and Plaza’s character Busker originally meet in Clockworks psychiatric hospital, where the former has received a schizophrenia diagnosis as a result of the “voices” he is able to hear. Once Haller is rescued, however, he is told that those voices are not symptoms but telepathic powers. In a world where television shows from Mr Robot to Crazy Ex-Girlfriend are tackling mental health with increasing sensitivity, Legion’s equation of mental illness and superheroism has ided critics, with some praising Legion’s detailed depiction of the condition, and others criticising the show for using schizophrenia as a flimsy way to court thrills. Busker begins (and, in some senses, ends) her life in a psychiatric ward, so I’m interested to hear Plaza’s take on the issue. Yet while she acknowledges her character had “addiction problems”, Plaza sounds unclear about Lenny’s precise ailment, claiming “it wasn’t something that was ever labelled”. For that reason, she says, she didn’t do much research into the subject of mental illness in preparation for the role. Instead, she stresses the way the show mines horror from the disorientating nature of mental distress. “What is real, what is not real – it’s the overall question,” says Plaza. “Going mad is one of the scariest ideas for me. To not trust your own mind is a really frightening idea.”Legion is indeed frightening. A sense of nameless horror pervades every scene, as the grotesque monsters that plague Haller’s memories shift in and out of focus (“I have some friends who can’t watch it because they’re so disturbed by it,” says Plaza). Lenny was initially written to be played by a middle-aged man, with Plaza insisting all the original dialogue remained intact, meaning Lenny ends up both crass and subtly androgynous.It’s something that becomes especially apparent when Lenny is viewed in the context of the show’s other major female character Syd, a wide-eyed, girlish mutant who begins a romantic relationship with Haller. I ask Plaza how it feels to play a character whose gender seems so ambiguous. “I love it,” she says. “There’s a fluidity to Lenny and I just think it’s more interesting playing a character that’s not so identifiable. It’s really fun to decide how someone like that moves and looks - it’s allowed me to do whatever I want.” Sporting a curly bob and a selection of suits and dungarees, Plaza spends most of Legion physically unrecognisable - swaggering and manspreading, as well as cajoling and threatening Haller with a blokey air. But as time goes on and the Shadow King becomes more desperate, Lenny uses intimidation tactics that feel sexually loaded and sinister. “I think it’s really interesting when you have a character like that pitted against someone like David Haller,” says Plaza. “That dynamic was always really interesting to me because I feel like Lenny has a sexual energy to her, but it’s not always a feminine energy, it’s more kind of masculine.”Despite being possessed by the embodiment of evil, throughout all of this Lenny also remains Haller’s close pal from the psychiatric hospital, and Plaza interprets the original characters’ relationship as sexual too. “At times it feels like they’re just friends and at times it feels like there’s some kind of attraction there,” she says. Plaza’s next project is unsettling in a different sense. She stars in An Evening With Beverly Luff Linn, a film by Jim Hoskings, whose gross-out debut The Greasy Strangler proved to be one of the more curious films of 2016. Plaza describes it as a “quadrangle love story between four freaks”, and the film, which also features her Legion co-star Jemaine Clement, has already disturbed critics on the festival circuit (the Hollywood Reporter called it “strenuously weird”). It’s another eccentric addition to her CV, but Plaza still feels as if she doesn’t get enough odd scripts. “I like them strange,” she says. “I want more of them. I’ve always been drawn to weird movies, I loved John Waters and Christopher Guest growing up, and I’m always looking for stories you just can’t believe someone would think up.” Considering a dimension-hopping, mutant-baiting creature wasn’t enough to sate Plaza’s appetite for strange stories, you suspect that where weirdness is concerned, the astral plane’s not quite the limit.

You put it on and they gawp at footage of rivers, trees and bubbles until they have been lulled into a state of catatonia. It is, transparently, much more for parents than kids the closest thing you can get to spiking their milk with brandy now that society has come to frown on that.I have a feeling that – once word gets out – Daydreams will cross over into the mainstream. It is so artfully put together that, if BBC Four put it out under the slow-TV banner, it would probably break viewing records. The closest equivalent, at least superficially, is 2015’s Dawn Chorus: The Sounds of Spring, one of the very first pieces of slow TV to be presented to the British public. Images drift in and out of focus, sounds boil up to the surface then fade away without ceremony.There is no narrative to speak of with Daydreams, but it is all held together by a cohesive sense of feeling. Remember when, during last year’s Twin Peaks revival, people would tell you that the best way to watch it was to switch off the analytical part of your mind and just let it wash over you? The same applies here, although obviously Daydreams is better because it contains fewer Nine Inch Nails songs.It’s technically a kids’ show, though, so there is some narration. But it’s one with pedigree guiding you through the various dreamscapes is none other than Olivia Colman, intermittently drifting in to remind the young audience to “pause” and reflect on something they’ve just seen. And while I’m biased – possibly because no episode of Broadchurch has ever calmed down a manic child – there may be an argument to call it her best work. The music is by Tom Jenkinson, AKA Squarepusher, who delivers some of his gentle ambient rather than his drill’n’bass.The whole show is full of lofty reference points. In its extreme closeups of trees and streams and blades of grass, it draws parallels with peak Terrence Malick. In its soundtrack, which narcoleptically bobs and weaves as it draws everything into a satisfying whole, it comes off like a Boards of Canada production. And, in its final passage, as day turns to night and focus is dropped – and Daydreams becomes little more than a series of abstract shapes and colours – it becomes a kindergarten Kubrick. It’s heady, impressive stuff.Best of all, it works. Everyone in our house was ill last weekend, with the exception of our three-year-old, who insisted on ricocheting off every available surface, ignoring our pleas for mercy. As an experiment, I put Daydreams on. Not only did he, more or less instantly, calm down, but by the time it finished he was so relaxed that he fell asleep in the middle of his bedtime story. That may not sound too impressive, but in this household it’s seismic. We’re taking him on a long-haul flight in a few months. Try and stop me from downloading Daydreams to an iPad.If I had to be picky, I couldn’t call Daydreams perfect – one time-lapse montage of blossoming flowers comes a little too early in the show, and at that point it feels like an unearned abstraction – but it’s close. God, is it close.The mood that Daydreams creates is integral to CBeebies – its woozy, gentle Bedtime Hour is such a mainstay of modern parenthood that the channel is obliged to warn viewers of impending schedule changes weeks in advance – but this feels like a whole new level. Daydreams is an experience first and a programme second. If it wasn’t successful, you’d have to applaud the BBC’s audacity for making it in the first place. But it is and, next time I find myself unable to sleep, I may just find reach for it myself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/625dc7ca1daaac340f579bd7ebbce866f44bbb69/0_86_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=54757ef0d7c44f92d313d10986fdbc6a 1240w","title":"james comey book former fbi agents reaction","story":"Former senior officials warn ex-director is putting Russia investigation in jeopardy with book and ‘tasteless’ commentsFormer senior FBI agents have accused James Comey of damaging the agency’s reputation and “playing a dangerous game” with the Russia investigations by going on the offensive with an explosive book and media interviews. Those speaking out also say they have been contacted by multiple agents currently working for the FBI who are displeased and uncomfortable with Comey, their ex-director, getting into a fierce war of words with the president, who fired him last year.Comey’s book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth Lies, and Leadership, is being published on Tuesday and has been previewed in the Guardian and some other outlets. And in a lengthy interview with ABC on Sunday night, the former director of the FBI said Donald Trump was morally unfit to be president. But his high-profile commentary has upset former colleagues who had held him in high regard both personally and professionally.“It’s tasteless at best. There is a total lack of dignity. He, and a number of other FBI employees who worked directly for him, have damaged the agency,” Nancy Savage, executive director of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, said of Comey’s book and interview.Savage, who was an agent for 30 years and was president of the FBI special agents association while serving, before she retired in 2011, told the Guardian it was highly inappropriate for Comey to talk about matters relating to the president that are currently under investigation.In his interview with ABC on Sunday, Comey discussed topics such as whether Trump may have obstructed justice by pressing him, while he was still FBI director, to drop his inquiry into the former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s links to Russia. Comey repeated his assertion that Trump asked him for his loyalty, and he aired unconfirmed allegations that Russia has compromising personal material on the president.These issues are among those under investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller and two Senate committees.She also criticized some Comey colleagues such as Andrew McCabe, who was fired  last month over accusations of leaking to the press.Serving agents generally shy away from speaking publicly about FBI matters or politics but there has been plenty of talk behind the scenes. Savage and other former agents said they had heard from FBI staff in the hours since Comey’s interview on ABC aired, and they were not happy.Former senior agent Bobby Chacon said: “The majority of people I have spoken to since Sunday night think it’s unfortunate timing. They are rolling their eyes it’s not good.”Chacon retired in 2014 as head of the FBI underwater forensic e team based in Los Angeles, after being an agent for 27 years. He said there were “still plenty of people” in the agency who supported Comey but many were upset at him “standing on a soapbox”.Chacon is also concerned that Comey, by talking about issues involving Russia and the Trump administration and election campaign, is opening himself up to a tough cross examination if he appears as a witness in any criminal proceedings arising from the investigations.“Comey knows these things, so he may have made the judgment that he’s being careful, but he is playing a dangerous game,” said Chacon, adding: “I worked for him. He did a lot of good things at the FBI. He was popular and I didn’t like the way the White House sacked him ... but he made mistakes and now has been overtaken by his emotions. I’m surprised he has been dragged down into street-fighting with Trump.”Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI’s criminal ision, said he thought Comey had been out of the FBI for long enough that his public comments were less likely to compromise the work of Mueller or Congress. But he said that he believed, and had heard from serving agents, that Comey’s speaking out was only fuel to Trump’s criticism of the agency.“I’m very confident that Robert Mueller knows how to conduct his investigation. But by talking like this Comey is not helping the FBI’s ability to fight back against the attacks on its reputation that have been coming from Trump,” he said. He said it would exacerbate the rift between Trump and the FBI.“I expect these wounds to remain open for a very long time,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64e028207757c79dbeacc74ccd461a32b42b6149/0_208_4866_2919/master/4866.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=718bb1bb1227a8ec0359ba17389864aa 1240w","title":"younger volunteers free bus travel","story":"Under-25 bus passes would be a great way to get more young people volunteering, according to one charityLabour’s policy, unveiled on 11 April, of offering free bus passes to young people aged under 25 has been described as modest. It’s part of the party’s wider policy of getting more local bus services back into direct council control. But one sector is jumping for joy at the possibility of even that modest contribution towards young people’s travel. Charities that work with young volunteers believe the move would help them find and retain more people.Caley Eldred, director of development for City Year UK, a charity that places young volunteer mentors in primary schools to support pupils from disadvantaged communities, says the young people they work with make a huge commitment. They volunteer full-time for a whole year and Eldred says that while the charity supports them financially as much as it can with travel and daily costs, free bus travel would enable it to invest even more in its volunteers’ professional and personal development. “Travel costs, particularly in the south-east, are huge, and our dedicated volunteer mentors often travel long distances by train, bus, tube and tram to get to the schools and pupils they serve,” says Eldred. “We want to see such proposals expanded to include more forms of transport, improving accessibility for all young people.One of the charity’s volunteers is 18-year-old Nicole Alderson, who has been volunteering at a primary school near Salford since finishing her A-levels last year, and who has to travel across Manchester every weekday to be at school for 8am. “If there’s not much traffic, the journey takes about an hour and a half,” says Alderson. “I have to get a bus into the town centre and then a bus up to the school, which is past Salford.”As Alderson is not a student, she can’t get a concession, and her bus fares cost £18 every week. City Year reimburse the cost, but, as she explains, that means having to keep every bus receipt and claiming them back. “If you lose a receipt, you don’t get paid.”What does she think of Labour’s proposal? “That would make my life so, so much easier,” she says. “It’s not just getting to school. I don’t drive, so this is my only means of transport when I’m just travelling around.” For Alderson, volunteering full-time in a school has been a real turning point. She wasn’t sure what she wanted to do after A-levels. “I knew I wanted to work in education, but I was dead scared to go straight to uni in case I didn’t like it,” she explains. Her college librarian showed her City Year’s website and she signed up for the year-long volunteering scheme. “City Year focused on education inequality and tackles that through education,” says Alderson. “There’s also a focus on social mobility, through us, the mentors. I help children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Of course there are teachers and teaching assistants, but we bridge the gap, help children open up.” Alderson says she loves the scheme. “I’ve never done anything in my life like it, and it’s not just about helping the children. For young people, it helps us with our confidence and leadership skills, and looks great on our CV.”In September, Alderson is heading to Salford University to study theatre and performance. “Then I want to do a teaching degree,” she says. “Volunteering has helped me be sure about what I want to do. But it’s not just the work in school. We also get training from City Year, with workshops, and stuff like CVs. It’s loads of different things that will help us. So we’re not just given experience in school, but life skills and how to apply for jobs. It has really helped - and it has helped me grow as a person. It fills my heart with joy.”Sign up now for our free, monthly Voluntary Sector newsletter, and share your view with us via @GdnvoluntaryLooking for a role in the not-for-profit sector, or need to recruit staff?

Last year the government sought to liberalise contracts with a new code of conduct: minimum one-year contracts were ditched and customers were given the power to cancel a contract without penalty on the advice of a doctor.In the latest development, the Order of Physicians has backed a doctor who admitted to writing a medical note for a woman because he did not believe she had the funds to see out a €70-a-month contract (£60) that had a further 18 months to run.The doctor told the watchdog – the equivalent of the General Medical Council in the UK – that he had a responsibility to help his patient and had “acted out of social concern”.“At these fitness clubs there are often really tight contracts that you almost can’t get rid of,” he said.Lieven Wostyn, regional chairman of the watchdog, said it had to deal with an increasing number of such cases.She said: “The social also plays a role in a doctor. And there was also a medical problem: the woman suffered from pain in the neck and a trailing middle ear infection.“We get complaints about this more often than before. We look very closely at each complaint. There have also been cases where the fitness centre has been right.”Eric Vandenabeele, the director of the professional association of gyms in Belgium, Fitness.be, described the ruling as “unacceptable”.He said: “A doctor has to judge your health, not whether it was a good idea to conclude such a contract. Will a doctor now judge your contract with your energy supplier, or with your internet provider?”In the UK, the Office for Fair Trading (OFT) acted in 2012 to reduce the number of gyms that tied their clients into long contracts.The OFT has claimed its intervention in the market benefited more than 750,000 gym members. There are believed to be about 8.75 million active gym members in the UK.The OFT claimed its move was also followed by innovations such as the rise of “pay-as-you-go” memberships.However, the Belgian authorities have been slower to respond to the problem.Simon November, of the Belgian consumers’ organisation Test-Aankoop, said: “It shows how these strangling contracts remain a problem and how few flexible fitness centres exist. We have been complaining for years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef2a0d8f516fdecdeac8a62bb1bae6abeb389818/754_618_1781_1068/master/1781.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9fb15e25f5e7ffa9fce7975e8b5390dd 1240w","title":"commonwealth leaders choose next head after queen this week","story":"Ahead of leaders’ retreat, Theresa May makes clear that UK backs Prince Charles as next symbolic leader of organisationCommonwealth leaders could decide this week on who takes over from the Queen as head of the organisation, Downing Street has said.The news came as Theresa May prepared to address her fellow national leaders on Tuesday. The prime minister is expected to urge the Commonwealth to engage and inspire the next generation, and to pledge £212m to help a million girls get a better education.She also made clear the UK backed Prince Charles to be the new head of the Commonwealth. The position was passed from his grandfather to his mother but is not hereditary.May’s spokesman said Charles had proven a “proud supporter of the Commonwealth for four decades and has spoken passionately about the organisation’s unique ersity”.No 10 said: “Succession is a matter for the Commonwealth as a whole to determine. If any discussion did take place it would happen at the leaders’ retreat at Windsor on Friday. Decisions in the Commonwealth are made by consensus.”Commonwealth leaders are gathering in London for an executive session on Thursday, before a retreat at the castle.The organisation’s secretary general, Patricia Scotland, said the retreat was a chance for the leaders to talk one to one without outside interference.“On the retreat, the 53 leaders get to go away together with no agenda and just talk about all the things that they desire to talk about. That enables them to deal with some quite tricky, sensitive issues, but collectively, collegiately and as part of the family,” she said.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, had suggested on BBC television on Sunday that the figurehead role could go to a rotating president. “The Queen clearly is personally very committed to the Commonwealth but after her I think maybe it’s a time to say, well, actually the Commonwealth should decide who its own president is on a rotational basis.”Queen Elizabeth, who is 91, has been the symbolic head of the Commonwealth since 1952. Charles is heir to the throne in 16 of the 53 Commonwealth member states, which are chiefly territories that used to be part of the former British empire.In her speech on Tuesday, May is expected to warn that a failure to engage and inspire the next generation will see the Commonwealth dismissed as “an irrelevance”. She will say she is “confident about our chances of success” in building a “bright future” for the organisation.In front of an audience expected to include the Microsoft founder, philanthropist and anti-malaria campaigner Bill Gates, May is expected to pledge the money towards making sure children living in developing Commonwealth countries receive 12 years of quality education. She will also call on leaders to commit to halving levels of malaria by 2023."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59bac9f1b06bab3c96133e1cf6d56e1991b905f8/0_108_5278_3168/master/5278.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9f895d28a7778734e21cd55399a714d0 1240w","title":"japan offers to lend hand in chinas toilet revolution","story":"Home of the hi-tech toilet offers technological support to help Xi Jinping in his mission to update lavatories across the countryJapan has reportedly offered its expertise in the subject of hi-tech toilets to China to help the nation on its mission to revolutionise lavatories across the country.In high-level meetings on Sunday and Monday, officials from China and Japan pledged to improve ties, from cooperating on North Korea to avoiding a global trade war, and potentially working together on infrastructure projects around the world.But infrastructure of a different kind was also on the agenda. Japan’s embassy in Beijing has reportedly been in talks with Chinese officials about Japanese support of China’s so-called toilet revolution.According to the Nikkei Asian Review, Japan’s ministry of foreign affairs, as well as two other ministries, have been seeking ideas from private companies including the inventor of the washlet, Toto, for how to help China.The idea was previously raised in December when Toshihiro Nikai, secretary general of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic party, visited the Chinese communist party’s central party school in Beijing and proposed new areas of cooperation, including hygiene and quality toilets. Sino-Japanese toilet cooperation takes place as the two countries promise to reset relations that have been disrupted by territorial disputes. Japan has deployed toilet diplomacy in India and south-east Asia but its toilets have failed to catch on in major markets like the US.  In 2015, Xi launched a nationwide campaign to replace many of China’s squat toilets for foreign tourists as well as for domestic use. Xi described the mission as part of his country’s “revitalisation” and an important measure to “improve quality of life of the masses”.China’s National Tourism administration said it would build or upgrade at least 64,000 toilets between 2018 and 2020. In February state news agency Xinhua reported that China’s toilet revolution was “right on track”, with new bathrooms installed on most of the country’s high speed trains.There have still been hiccups. In January the tourism administration asked local officials to stop spending so much on toilet projects. A public toilet in the western city of Chongqing reportedly cost 1 million yuan (about £100,000).  “We don’t need local governments trying to outdo each other with five-star toilets,” Li Jinzao, director of the administration said in a news conference."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2fef1a329d44d9a43fdf0dca64e8ad66653099e/0_119_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=92915ddf9e23c65928fd916a4503a0a1 1240w","title":"new zealanders deploy helicopters and thermal imaging to search for lost dogs","story":"Thousands of dollars, and hours, have been spent on searches for beloved canines at least three times in the past yearHelicopters, thermal-imaging equipment and thousands of volunteers are being deployed in the search for missing dogs in New Zealand, which has one of the highest rates of pet ownership in the OECD.In three separate cases this year, the search for missing dogs has attracted huge resources, thousands of dollars in donations and filled hundreds of hours as desperate owners have scoured the bush for their best friends.On Sunday, Benny the beagle was found safe and well in Belmont regional park north of Wellington after being missing for nine days.Benny’s owners hired a helicopter and used thermal imaging equipment and a megaphone from the SPCA to search for Benny, who was eventually found by friends hiking through the bush, a mere 100 metres from where he’d first disappeared.In March, in a case described as “remarkable” and “unbelievable” by local media, Dunedin dog Meg was found alive five weeks after disappearing into the bush following a car crash.Search and rescue volunteers gave up their free time to co-ordinate rescue efforts, hundreds of people scoured hundreds of hectares of dense bush, and a drone was deployed to search from the air.Meg was evenutally found injured, sick and severely underweight on a farm not far from the crash sight.She was treated for free by the Dunedin Wildlife hospital, which received more than NZ$4,000 (£2,051) in donations for her treatment from donors, as well as the NZ$2,000 reward from Cunningham, which the local farmer who found Meg refused to accept.Local school children have sent Meg get well letters during her recovery, and she has been become known as the “megadog”, with more than 1,500 followers of her Facebook blog, charting her recovery.In March, Canterbury man Russell Waters hired a helicopter to search for his missing chocolate labrador Roger, as well as galvanising hundreds of volunteers to search.He also considered offering his boat as a reward for the person who found Roger.“He’s my best friend, he’s my best mate, he’s my life,” Waters told Newshub at the time.“It’s not a matter of wanting him back, it’s a matter of needing him back, really.”Roger was found whimpering in a ditch not far from Waters’s house, and vets believe he was hit by a car and couldn’t get home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42762ad2489cb444707a08cda7b14acd9056ff76/104_200_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?w=5250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8647216cd5f090ee5e62c8ec77837f61 10500w","title":"tuesday briefing fair wind at last for caribbean born citizens","story":"Amber Rudd vows to fix ‘appalling’ situation of Windrush generation … Brexit legislation piles up in parliament … and how sleep became big businessAmber Rudd vows to fix ‘appalling’ situation of Windrush generation … Brexit legislation piles up in parliament … and how sleep became big businessGood morning – Warren Murray back with you today.The government has made an unprecedented apology over the “appalling” treatment of Windrush-era citizens, who have been threatened with deportation and denied access to public services after being classed as illegal immigrants. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, promised to resolve their status within two weeks. “Frankly, how they have been treated has been wrong – has been appalling – and I am sorry,” said Rudd. “This is about iniduals, and we have heard the inidual stories, some of which have been terrible to hear.”The Guardian has been documenting a growing scandal over the past five months affecting an unknown number of people who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean as children (often on parents’ or siblings’ passports) but were never formally naturalised or hadn’t applied for a British passport. Under the Conservative government’s “hostile” immigration environment policy they were unable to prove their right to remain in Britain.Rudd’s announcement came after the prime minister was forced into an embarrassing U-turn over Downing Street’s initial refusal to schedule a meeting requested by 12 Caribbean heads of government to discuss the problem at the Commonwealth summit in London. Anger remains, though, along with a degree of scepticism that fairness will now prevail. Satbir Singh from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said government policy had turned Britain into a “hostile society” and the Home Office into an “island of inhumanity and incompetence … This is the first time that the government has been forced to account for these deliberate decisions. We hope it marks the start of a conversation about how we treat all those who seek to make a life here.” Syria latest – Overnight, Russia has announced that chemical weapons inspectors will be allowed to visit Douma, site of the poison gas attack that triggered US, British and French air strikes against the Assad regime. The US claims Russia may already have tampered with the site. In Britain, Theresa May has told MPs there was no time to get UN approval before launching the air strikes in Syria. May dismissed Jeremy Corbyn’s criticisms and said waiting in such cases would effectively mean “a Russian veto on our foreign policy … It is in our national interest to prevent the further use of chemical weapons in Syria. We have not done this because President Trump asked us to do so. We have done it because we believed it was the right thing to do.”Brexit logjam – Almost half the bills needed for Brexit have yet to be introduced to parliament, it has emerged. Parliament will only sit for another 80 days before MPs are expected to vote on the final Brexit deal and it looks like the government will struggle to pass the necessary legislation before then. “It’s frankly embarrassing that, more than 10 months since the general election, the government hasn’t passed a single piece of Brexit legislation,” said Jenny Chapman, the shadow Brexit minister. Theresa May is meanwhile facing a possible defeat as the Lords debates an amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU. Rafael Behr says that at this point, leavers are able to exploit a “growing complacency and fatalism around Brexit”. There is no enthusiasm in parliament for May’s Brexit, he writes, but “parliament couldn’t be bothered to lead the way back”.Oliver and done with – Jamie Oliver has been forced to give up his Australian restaurants after the group was placed in the hands of administrators.

The researchers were experimenting with bacteria that could break down plastic when they isolated and inadvertently enhanced the potent catalyst. “What we are hoping to do is use this enzyme to turn this plastic back into its original components, so we can literally recycle it back to plastic,” said Prof John McGeehan from the University of Portsmouth. “It means we won’t need to dig up any more oil and, fundamentally, it should reduce the amount of plastic in the environment.”Tiredness seems to be the new norm – no wonder companies are selling sleep aids from spooning robots to cuddle blankets.So how did a restful night become a luxury item?

The Mail calls it an outrage and a “fiasco that shames Britain”, while the Guardian and Telegraph lead on Amber Rudd’s apology. The Mirror says it is one of a number of “shameful” episodes involving Theresa May, lumping it in with her response to the Syrian chemical attacks, the Grenfell tower disaster and the NHS.The Sun and Mirror are preoccupied with an apology of a different order.

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition. In a malnourished population the disease severity and duration of an infectious disease can be much greater.”Researchers are now conducting a follow-up study to assess whether the nutritional situation has changed.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Macron warns of European \u0026#39civil war\u0026#39 over growing East-West ideBillionaire banking heir Matthew Mellon dies in rehab aged 54Public support for Syria airstrikes has increased - but Labour supporters still overwhelmingly oppose itMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s parents and siblings who will become Prince Harry\u0026#39s familyGovernment challenges SNP Brexit Bill in Supreme CourtRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV  British man arrested for allegedly kicking his Thai wife to death after accusing her of having an affair The incredible life story of actress Choi Eun-hee, abducted by North Korea and forced to make films for Kim Jong-ilForest Gate teen stabbed to death in latest London killingPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsStephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainAlfie Evans\u0026#39 parents lose legal fight to have their son flown to Rome for treatmentAnt McPartlin given biggest ever drink-drive fine as he is told to pay £86k Russia to allow chemical weapons inspectors into Douma amid concerns attack site has been \u0026#39tampered with\u0026#39 Gardeners must prune roses, plant potatoes and mow the lawn in short spring window, experts warnWomen who want to conceive should adopt a healthy diet years earlierCanada withdraws diplomats\u0026#39 families from Cuba over mystery illnessComment: Windrush children like me are being put in an appalling situation.

Get off my head. Don\u0027t keep doing that to my head.\u0026quotWhen paramedics were called, they noted injuries to his hand, burns to arms and legs which were being self treated with cling film.He was taken to Bedford Hospital\u0027s acute clinical unit and then to Addenbrookes Hospital. Miss Syed said: \u0026quotFive per cent of his total body surface was scalded.\u0026quot Days later, Worth was arrested.Judge Madge told Worth that as well as the violence she had carried out on her partner she had refused him adequate bedding and food.He said she would \u0026quotbelittle\u0026quot her partner and discouraged him from contacting friends and his family.\u0026quotShe accepts that she has in the past, on a number of occasions, used blunt objects and implements to strike him and that he suffered injuries as a result of her doing so,” he said.“She accepts using boiling or hot water to cause injury to him. She accepts that she has in the past used a knife to cause injury to her partner.\u0026quotHe suffered from hydrocephalus and had a vulnerable head and he became increasingly isolated.”Worth, who is now in a new relationship, was made the subject of a restraining order which prevents her from contacting her ex for an indefinite period.Macron warns of European \u0026#39civil war\u0026#39 over growing East-West ideBillionaire banking heir Matthew Mellon dies in rehab aged 54Public support for Syria airstrikes has increased - but Labour supporters still overwhelmingly oppose itMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s parents and siblings who will become Prince Harry\u0026#39s familyGovernment challenges SNP Brexit Bill in Supreme CourtRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV  British man arrested for allegedly kicking his Thai wife to death after accusing her of having an affair The incredible life story of actress Choi Eun-hee, abducted by North Korea and forced to make films for Kim Jong-ilForest Gate teen stabbed to death in latest London killingPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsStephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainAlfie Evans\u0026#39 parents lose legal fight to have their son flown to Rome for treatmentAnt McPartlin given biggest ever drink-drive fine as he is told to pay £86k Russia to allow chemical weapons inspectors into Douma amid concerns attack site has been \u0026#39tampered with\u0026#39 Gardeners must prune roses, plant potatoes and mow the lawn in short spring window, experts warnWomen who want to conceive should adopt a healthy diet years earlierCanada withdraws diplomats\u0026#39 families from Cuba over mystery illnessComment: Windrush children like me are being put in an appalling situation.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy.

Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough.

It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAneira Thomas, the first baby to be born on the NHS, addresses the Unison Health Conference at the Brighton CentreSir Patrick Stewart addresses the crowd during the People\u0027s Vote campaign launch on Brexit at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town.

Victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles come together to take part in the Time for truth march through Belfast city centre against the stalled efforts in dealing with Northern Ireland\u0027s legacy issues.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sterling’s surge, which pulled the FTSE 100 down three points at the open has been attributed to optimism ahead of wages and unemployment data, released on Tuesday morning, weakness in the dollar, and reduced concerns around the possibility of a hard Brexit as the UK and EU get ready for the next round of negotiations.  Sterling rises as Mark Carney signals hawkish stance on ratesTraders pushed the pound up in anticipation of Tuesday’s data, with expectations that the numbers would lend support to a spring rate rise by the Bank of England.The figures from the Office for National Statistics showed wages were up 2.8 per cent in the three months to February, compared to the same time last year, which was higher than the rate of inflation in the same period. However, traders were expecting earnings growth to hit 3 per cent, and sterling pared its gains following the release of the data, falling back to $1.434, and dropping 0.09 per cent against the euro to €1.1572.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Last month, the International Energy Agency reported that Venezuela is and will probably remain “the biggest risk factor” in a global supply crisis that may soon tip the market into deficit.The desperate parents leaving their children at orphanagesThe speed of decline in production has been vertiginous, with output falling by 100,000 barrels a day in February, according to Bloomberg. The Central University of Venezuela says production is reaching its lowest point in 70 years.Most of the enormous oil reserves Venezuela has access to – almost 25 per cent of all the oil controlled by the world’s biggest producers – is heavy crude, and needs to be diluted with lighter oil to become a commercially viable product.In 2016, with its own industry failing to deliver, Venezuela imported diluents for the first time in its history. In the two years since, those imports have grown to as many as 200,000 barrels a day, mostly from the US, according to Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American energy policy at Rice University in Texas.The long queues for food and medicine in Venezuela are now well documented, but lines of cars waiting outside petrol stations – something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago, when petrol cost $0.01 (0.7p) per litre – are becoming more common.Filling your tank is still cheaper than drinking water in Venezuela, but the industry can no longer meet domestic demands – and is having to put exports first. Monaldi says that if production continues to fall to below a million barrels, the consequences could be catastrophic.“The domestic consumption of oil is around 450,000 barrels and Venezuela needs the exports to repay its debt with Russia and China,” he says.“They have to import for two reasons. One is the collapse of the refining infrastructure and the other is that its oil is naturally heavy so they need to import diluents to blend with their oil to re-export it.Grieving families teargassed by police after 68 killed in prison fireWhy Venezuela’s new bitcoin alternative is so controversialVenezuela’s most-wanted rebel shared his story, just before deathVenezuela plans to launch an oil-backed cryptocurrency “One of the craziest things is that a part of Venezuela’s imports is for the domestic market, but given its price, they practically give gasoline away for free. They are importing barrels that cost $80 to $90 and selling them at $0.”Monaldi says the only hope is for a major change in politics. He estimates it would take a decade for Venezuela to go back to what it was, and maybe much longer than that.Venezuelan polling group IVAD suggests that elections next month are not looking good for President Nicolas Maduro. Of those polled, 77 per cent believe that the country needs a change of government, the main reasons stated being lack of food and medicine, insecurity and the high cost of living.The IMF expects the Venezuelan economy to shrink by 15 per cent in 2018, and the country is facing the worst decline of GDP in recorded history in Latin America. It estimates that by the end of 2018, the accumulated decline will be almost 50 per cent from its peak in 2013.Oil makes up more than 90 per cent of the nation’s exports, but a combination of government corruption, lack of investment and the migration of qualified staff have left the industry in ruins. It’s a crisis that has directly hit the country’s ability to import resources like food or medicine for the Venezuelan population.It is a vicious spiral. It is estimated that 10 per cent of the population has emigrated. Almost two thirds of all households have at least one family member living abroad. And among those 3 million migrants are young and competent workers who have escaped from a country that sinks deeper into crisis.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
