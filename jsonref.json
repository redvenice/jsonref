Stormont does not plan to ease any restrictions until April 1.And Wales has the lowest infection rate (43.3).Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has allowed children aged three to seven to return to schools, with all primary school children expected to be back behind their desks from mid-March.The UK nation also permits up to four people from two different households to meet outdoors for socially-distanced exercise.Covid infection rates are still falling in all four UK nations.Mr Swayne told MailOnline: \u0027What I think is extraordinary is the way the Government has lost the sense of urgency about the cost, the daily cost, the cost of business and the cost to people\u0027s mental health of lockdown.\u0027\u0027Their caution comes at a phenomenal price.

This is not sustainable.\u0027Separate data from Test and Trace showed England recorded 45,229 Covid cases in the week to March 3, which was a drop of 30 per cent from the more than 70,000 cases identified the week before.Ms Sturgeon revealed this week she would relax lockdown rules in Scotland earlier, adding her Government \u0027will not hesitate\u0027 to loosen measures earlier if the data supports it.They moved forward allowing gatherings for up to four people for \u0027social and recreational reasons\u0027, including in private gardens, to March 12 — three days earlier than planned.For children aged 12 and 17, outdoor meetings will also be limited to four people but these can be from up to four households.

We spoke to five teachers who excel at this part of the job to find out how they make it happen.‘It grew bigger than we ever expected’When Kate Woodward, a teacher at Lyndhurst primary school, in Oldham, set up an after-school club on global issues, she had no idea how popular it would become. Her aim was to give pupils who might not have conversations about world issues at home a chance to discuss them with their friends.Woodward, who studied psychology at Lancaster University, then did her PGCE at the University of Manchester, says the club, which is on hold because of Covid-19, is led by the children. “Initially we mind mapped what they wanted to get out of the club,” she says. “And we decided to look at the effects of fast fashion on the environment.”Through the club, the children, aged from seven to 11, have learned about the global, environmental and social impact of buying disposable clothes. The main activity, which they enthusiastically supported, was making a map out of old clothes they brought in.Woodward says she’s passionate about creating “empathetic and well-rounded iniduals” and hopes the club is encouraging the children to see the world in a different way. “I wanted to do something around geography and history because I think they’re such important subjects, and becoming more important in day-to-day life. It’s been lovely to see,” she says.‘Schools are where we learn about the world’Creating caring, compassionate and confident adults is important to James Clarke, who teaches drama and health education at Whitefield school, in Barnet, north London. “Schools are where we learn about the world and are exposed to the world.”His school is working on an “intergenerational” programme, where year 9 students and people in hospital with dementia collaborate on creative projects. The aim is to get it back up and running after lockdown. Sessions are run online via video calls, which are streamed live in both the classroom and the hospital. “As one part of the project, we shared stories and words and came up with a poem,” Clarke says.Clarke, who studied drama, applied theatre and education at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, followed by a PGCE at the University of the Arts London, says he tries to get students involved with the local community as much as he can. “It’s hard to pass an exam, but you’ll learn it and you’ll get there,” he says. “But to learn about being human is so much more difficult – and that’s all part of the role of being a teacher.”Clarke says he struggled in school because of his sexuality and he doesn’t want other young people to feel that they’re not accepted or loved. “If just one student walks out and feels positive and valued then I feel I’ve done my job,” he says.‘There’s quite a lot of bonding when you’re washing cars’Anya Peyton, a history teacher who is now assistant principal at Hanham Woods academy in Bristol, is passionate about building confidence and empathy in her students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.Peyton was one of the first in her family to go to university she studied history and politics at the University of Southampton. “I come from a working class, single parent background, and I wasn’t sure what I was going to do at university,” she says. However, with encouragement from one of her teachers, she made her application.Having finished her degree, she spent a stint volunteering in a school. That experience helped her realise that teaching was where her future lay, and she went on to study for her PGCE at the University of Bristol. “I liked the idea of helping people,” she says. “Just like that teacher did for me.”Peyton makes a point of helping her students to become conscientious adults. One Christmas, they collected toiletries such as toothbrushes and toothpaste, wrapped them in festive paper and took them to the local library so they could be given to homeless people. Another time, students organised a charity car wash. “I ended up out there washing the cars with them,” Peyton says.Projects such as these help students to hone their empathy, Peyton says. “Washing cars, there was quite a lot of bonding and friendship,” she says. “It was good to see them work together. They already had that caring in them we just gave them an outlet for it.”In turn, this gives pupils the all-important confidence to succeed in life. “It matters because it turns them into people who are happy,” Peyton says. “Giving back to the local community does wonders for their wellbeing, because they know they’ve made a difference.”It also helps Peyton on a personal level. “I’m passionate about it because it’s good for pupils and it’s good for the community,” she says. “One of the things that’s kept me going throughout the pandemic has been my job and the fact that I really love it.”Betts, who studied business management at the University of Exeter and a PGCE at Bath Spa University, previously worked with students through the National Citizens Service. Now a maths teacher, he gets involved in school activities such as the chess club, the football club and helping out with charity events.“I’ve particularly enjoyed training the football teams,” he says. “I try to put my point across that it’s about more than just being a skilful player on the pitch, it’s about being a good sportsman, leading your team, lifting your team up when you’re having a bad game, looking out for each other and being a good teammate.”Betts believes empathetic teachers inspire their students. “Young people see you as a role model,” he says. “If you can show your whole self, in terms of your strengths, your weaknesses, your compassion and your empathy, as well as your flaws, you help give them confidence.”‘I wanted to make a difference in my community’Sian Green teaches religion and philosophy at Chiswick School, in west London, and says she became a teacher because she wanted to give back to society. Green, who studied philosophy at the University of Manchester and a PGCE through Teach First at the University of Manchester, says: “I wanted to make a difference in my community in some way, and I knew how important school was in shaping who we become as adults.”As part of her philosophy classes, Green and her students explore what’s good for us as iniduals versus what’s for the general moral good. For example, in a recent class her students discussed wearing masks during Covid-19.Green also talks about social justice and racial discrimination. “We’re all different. I try to encourage our students to think outside of their own experience and use their reasoning. We tackle issues in an intelligent and empathetic way,” she says.Outside the classroom, Green co-founded the social enterprise Sex Ed Matters, which helps equip teachers with the confidence and skills needed to deliver the new relationships and sex education (RSE) curriculum.Overall, she wants her students to be comfortable in their own skins and to develop emotional intelligence. “Emotional intelligence is often something that has been sidelined but is something that is crucially important for all of us,” she says.By having such conversations in the classroom, Green says that she and her students can gain new perspectives: “We can understand the world around us much better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c5cf0998f9ad6af8c1eef61d561167fa2e5d6a2/0_219_3255_1953/master/3255.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=09a2174e41f0f4ada94a7d0a48a585ed","title":"bright lights big city hong kongs neon at night in pictures","story":"When photographer Pascal Greco discovered neon, he became fascinated with how they brought poetry and magic to the city’s architecture.

Today, they’re both thrivingFrom debates over whether a scotch egg constitutes a substantial meal to questioning whether takeaway tea could be considered a picnic, over the past year the way we dine has had to be constantly redefined. And for the independent businesses keeping us fed during this tumultuous year, a flexible and adaptive mindset has been crucial.Though many small businesses have faced challenging times, others have embraced the unknown, and despite some ups and downs, are showing that out of chaos, can come reward. For Mandira Sarkar, owner of Mandira’s Kitchen, and deluxe doughnut makers Project D, pivoting quickly has become almost as much of an art form as their products.Sarkar’s business, launched in 2016, is based in a converted 16th-century barn outbuilding overlooking the picturesque Silent Pool lake near Guildford, Surrey. With an all-female (“except for one very brave man”) staff of 20, it produces home-style freezer meals – authentic, healthy dishes such as watercress dal and chicken xacuti, plus a range of samosas and biryanis. The business has a catering service, an onsite cafe and shop, and a cookery school. Pre-pandemic, it also offered spice tours for groups keen to learn about Indian flavours, followed by a meal in the cafe. But Mandira’s Kitchen has had to adapt almost every component of its operations.When they had to close their kiosks, the team had to completely rethink their business model. “We initially furloughed our 26 members of staff,” says Poynton. A few weeks later, though, as public demand for baking essentials skyrocketed, they brought them all back – Project D’s access to local farms had put them in a good position to sell eggs, flour and yeast. “We got our gazebo out and we were popping up in village car parks and town square car parks. We had hour-long queues for eggs. Looking back, it was really insane,” Poynton says. Once given council permission to sell doughnuts alongside the other staple essentials, they also started a doughnut delivery service, which has continued to attract high demand.Sarkar, too, remembers panicking “for about two days”, but then she and her team quickly got to work. Farm shops – the main customers of their freezer meals – were themselves struggling, so she began to market to inidual customers instead. Launching a brand new website, Sarkar pushed out the message that their tasty, healthy meals were perfect to have at home, and available at the click of a button. Local orders were soon followed by UK-wide demand.Sarkar kept innovating. First she enhanced her click-and-collect service, offering weekend thali feasts, a three-course meal complete with a Bollywood playlist, a quiz on India, and takeaway picnic baskets. They began to collaborate with a nearby vineyard and gin distillery, offering meals with accompanying wine, and jointly marketing to customers against the backdrop of the growing consumer movement to buy locally. Sarkar is also leading a weekly free cooking lesson that people can follow on Instagram Live. A special kit of six spice blends can be ordered beforehand to ensure the outcome is authentic. All these adaptations, says Sarkar, have resulted in their pandemic-era sales far outstripping the previous year’s.Both Sarkar and Project D mention the importance of persevering even when the going gets tough. “We’ve always had the attitude of never giving up,” says Bond. “We have this dream, this project, which we hold so dearly. And when that was nearly taken away from us, with everything that we put in, we weren’t ready to give up.”Strong branding was also key to Project D, who sold eggs using trays in their signature bubblegum pink. Their scooter, mini pickup truck, forklift and even the floors of their new bakery are all painted in the same shade.Although difficult in a pandemic, planning ahead as best as they can has also been an important element of their success. As the end of the Brexit transition period loomed, the team stockpiled some of their ingredients. “And we were right to do that, because some of our wholesalers actually ran out of some of our key ingredients,” says Poynton.For both of these independent food businesses, the past year has been hectic, often stressful, but in the end, hugely rewarding. For Sarkar, it has sometimes meant 18- or 19-hour days at work. “You can probably see the bags under our eyes,” she says. “But we’ve constantly, every day, innovated, adapted and been flexible at every single stage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef247e934d74ebb1f5a236dc31046554e5103f45/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f147a534f11dc3d190eea6df3f95f1c 880w","title":"homes renovated in lockdown in pictures","story":"From a former garage in east London to a castle-like rectory in Cheltenham"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa0ff30a98f8c82ca56e20d659aede13a4c357f2/607_1109_3066_1839/master/3066.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e2335032fd8e9c9bab059c6e2e8d3624","title":"the great global vaccine divide podcast","story":"The speed at which the world’s scientists have managed to create several effective Covid vaccines has been close to miraculous.

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, tells Anushka Asthana that it was then that the five-year nightmare began.

According to the study, the global twin birthrate has risen by one-third, on average, over the past 40 years.Rather than seeing the trend continue, the world may have reached “peak twin”, the authors say, as the most recent data suggest some countries have begun to see twinning rates plateau or even fall from historic highs.“The trends are really quite striking,” said Christiaan Monden, a professor of sociology and demography at Oxford University. “Over the past 40 to 50 years we’ve seen a strong increase in twinning rates in rich, developed countries, and that has led to more twins in both a relative and an absolute sense than we’ve seen ever before.”Twins are born naturally when a fertilised egg spontaneously splits in half, leading to identical twins, or when the mother releases two eggs at once that are both fertilised, producing non-identical twins. Most now are born as a result of fertility treatments, such as ovarian stimulation or having more than one in vitro fertilisation (IVF) embryo transferred into the womb at the same time, a practice now discouraged in many countries on health grounds.While the birthrate for identical twins has barely changed over time, Monden and his colleagues found that naturally conceived, non-identical twins and twins born as a result of medically assisted reproduction – an umbrella term for a range of fertility treatments – had risen globally.The main drivers are increased access to hormone treatment, IVF and other fertility services but also the postponement of parenthood – the chances of having natural, non-identical twins increases with age and peaks at 35 to 39 years old.Raj Mathur, the chair of the British Fertility Society and a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester, said: “It doesn’t surprise us that twinning rates have increased because the availability of assisted reproduction has increased and also because women are slightly older when they have their first children, and both those things will increase the twin rate.“I think we’ve reached a peak in terms of twinning rates from medical interventions, certainly in the developed world, but the spread of IVF in Africa and South America is still rather limited on a per capita basis, and there are vast numbers of sub-fertile people in Africa particularly who don’t have access to IVF. The challenge will be how to spread IVF to them without also giving them higher twin rates.“The majority of twin babies are absolutely fine, but there is no doubt that a twin pregnancy carries greater risks for the mother and the baby, so when we can avoid it we should avoid it. The principle we follow is neatly summed up by the phrase ‘one at a time’,” Mathur said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f6b8371d55c5e097dffaa5baeb6c9c8df04efed/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a8ba72e83aae0e8f83d006568e9e1ce9","title":"hemiandrus jacinda insect named after new zealand prime minister ardern","story":"New species of wētā, a giant flightless cricket, is seen as ‘reflecting traits’ of Jacinda ArdernNew Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has received what may be her greatest accolade yet: a large insect named in her honour.A new species of wētā – a giant flightless cricket that is endemic to New Zealand – has been named Hemiandrus jacinda for being Labour-party red in colour and “long-limbed”.Steven Trewick, a professor in evolutionary ecology at Massey University in New Zealand and the scientist who named and formally described the insect, said it had struck him for “reflecting traits of the prime minister”.It was a “striking species”, he said, and he considered it beautiful.The prime minister’s office said Ardern was “aware of this and very honoured”. A spokesperson added: “A beetle and a lichen, along with an ant in Saudi Arabia, have also been named after her.”More than 100 different species of wētā are found in trees, caves, bush and sometimes suburban gardens. As with all members of the Hemiandrus group, jacinda makes burrows in the ground, from which it emerges to hunt at night.The newly discovered species is bigger and more brightly coloured than the 17 ground wētā already recorded, and found in native forests in Northland, Bay of Plenty, Waikato and Coromandel in the upper North Island. It was described in the Zootaxa journal for the first time on Friday as “comparatively large, long-limbed, glossy and predominantly orange-red”.Trewick said it was remarkable that jacinda had evaded recognition until now, given that it had been found close to densely populated areas and that it was “not a small, cryptic beast but a hefty insect with flamboyant colouring”.It was proof that “in a time of accelerating environmental change, loss of natural habitat and global precipitous decline of the planet’s biological ersity, the work of species discovery continues,” he said.“The wētā of New Zealand are a rich and erse radiation of species living in all sorts of habitats – yet many remain to be recognised.”But just as jacinda had been discovered, Trewick warned it was likely to be already declining in abundance on the slide towards extinction. Wētā are threatened by introduced predators such as rats and cats, and habitat loss and modification such as farmland.A key feature of the Department of Conservation’s work to conserve wētā is to classify them, with significant variation between the species despite their genetic similarity and large gaps in the knowledge of their distribution, abundance and ecology.It highlighted yet another commonality between the big cricket and the prime minister, said Trewick: “Both matter to New Zealand a great deal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoWe are at the dawn of a new industrial revolution\u0026rsquo, says Eamon RyanChange in Bord Bia programme will compel members with \u0026euro50m turnover to set goalsHow car batteries are made and charged revealed as problematic in US studies"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4508505.1615541583!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 vaccines 99 per cent of target for over 85s met hse tackling gp delivery issues says donnelly","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAstrazeneca has admitted that the company was facing ‘complex’ problems with supply chainsFile photograph: Getty ImagesThe Health Service Executive (HSE) is making “significant changes” to address the issues with delivery of doses of the vaccine to general practices around the country, the Minister for Health said today. Stephen Donnelly also said 99 per cent of the target for the vaccination of the over-85 age group has been met.Speaking on RTÉ Radio’s Morning Ireland, the Minister said the HSE was making “significant changes” to address the issues with delivery of doses of the vaccine to general practices around the country.The Minister acknowledged distribution problems had caused anxiety for patients.Mr Donnelly also said he had been communicating with the AstraZeneca representative for Ireland to convey the Government’s frustration with the revised volumes and delivery dates.The representative had admitted that the company was facing “complex” problems with supply chains, the Minister said. AstraZeneca was doing everything they could and accepted that their actions were causing “real anxiety for people on the ground,” said Mr Donnelly. “They have committed to doing everything they can to fix that.”High-level communications were also ongoing between AstraZeneca and the EU’s steering committee about supply for the European Union, according to the Minister. Mr Donnelly said he did not think there was “any funny business going on” about supply of the vaccine to the United Kingdom and the United States. Ireland will keep up the pressure to get the supplies that were contacted and promised, he said, adding time mattters and that it was important to get people vaccinated quicker so the country could open up.When asked if the Taoiseach would raise the issue of the 30 million doses of AstraZeneca preordered by the United States where it has not yet been approved, Mr Donnelly said if Mr Martin believed raising this would be of use he would do so.The Minister called on the public to remain vigilant and not to let their guard down. He said although the number of cases was being suppressed there remained the issue of the mobility of the disease that was a cause for concern.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 154,089 had received their second dose.Some 167,303 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 268,462 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 100,613 had gone to people over the age of 70.Globally, over 300 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.Two doses of the vaccine, four weeks apart, are needed to offer the best protection against Covid. However, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket should begin to receive their first dose by March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4507755.1615476187!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peak twins more born than ever before but rate likely to drop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘The absolute number of twin deliveries has increased everywhere except in South America.’ Photograph: iStockMore human twins are being born than ever before, mainly due to medically assisted reproduction and women giving birth at an older age, according to the first global overview published on Friday.Since the 1980s the twinning rate has increased by one-third from 9 to 12 per 1,000 deliveries, meaning about 1.6 million twins are born each year worldwide and one in every 42 children born is a twin.“A major cause of this increase is the growth in medically assisted reproduction, which includes not only IVF techniques, but also simpler methods, such as ovarian stimulation and artificial insemination,” the study, published in the journal Human Reproduction, concludes.Another factor is delay in childbearing observed in many countries over recent decades, since the twinning rate increases with the mother’s age.However, the researchers think the peak in twinning rates may have been reached, particularly in high-income countries in Europe and North America, because of increasing emphasis on the importance of trying to achieve “singleton pregnancies”.Prof Christiaan Monden of the University of Oxford said: “The relative and absolute numbers of twins in the world are higher than they have ever been since the mid-20th century, and this is likely to be an all-time high. This is important as twin deliveries are associated with higher death rates among babies and children and more complications for mothers and children during pregnancy, and during and after delivery.”Substantial increasesWith Prof Gilles Pison of the French Museum of Natural History and Prof Jeroen Smits of Radboud University in the Netherlands, they collected information on twinning rates for the period 2010-2015 from 165 countries, covering 99 per cent of the world’s population. For 112 countries, they obtained information on twinning rates for 1980-1985.They found substantial increases in twinning rates in many European countries, North America and Asia. For 74 per cent out of 112 countries for which data was available for both periods, the increase was more than 10 per cent. There was a 32 per cent increase in Asia and a 71 per cent increase in North America.Prof Monden said: “In both periods Africa had the highest twinning rates and there was no significant increase over time. However, Europe, North America and the Oceanic countries are catching up rapidly. About 80 per cent of all twin deliveries in the world now take place in Asia and Africa.”The twinning rate in Africa is so high because of high numbers of “dizygotic twins” – born from two separate eggs. This is most likely to be due to genetic differences between the African population and others.“The absolute number of twin deliveries has increased everywhere except in South America. In North America and Africa, the numbers have increased by more than 80 per cent, and in Africa this increase is almost entirely caused by population growth,” Prof Monden said.Because infant mortality among twins has been going down, many more of the twins born in the second period of the study will grow up as twins compared with those born in the early 1980s.“However, more attention needs to be paid to the fate of twins in low- and middle-income countries,” Prof Smits noted. “In sub-Saharan Africa in particular, many twins will lose their co-twin in their first year of life, some 200,000-300,000 each year ... While twinning rates in many rich western countries are now getting close to those in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a huge difference in the survival chances.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4508516.1615541451!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pat kenny objection to dalkey nursing home planning application successful","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPat Kenny and his wife lodged an objection to the application for a nursing home by Bartra. File photograph: Frank MillerThe Broadcaster Pat Kenny has been successful in his opposition against plans for a five-storey 104-bedroom nursing home on a site beside his home in Dalkey, Co Dublin.Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council refused planning permission to Bartra Capital for the care home on Thursday.Kenny and his wife Kathy had lodged an objection against the plan.The Kenny submission was one of 37 lodged by locals with the Council concerning the planned scheme with Dalkey Community Council adding its weight behind the strong local opposition against the Bartra plan.However, the battle by the Kennys and their neighbours in trying to prevent the nursing home going ahead may not be over.The Kennys and their neighbours previously fought Bartra over a planned apartment complex on the same strip of land.Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council turned down that plan but Bartra secured planning permission for 18 apartments and six houses on the 1.4 acre site on appeal to an Bord Pleanála.Bartra is free to commence construction on the apartment scheme at any time.In their objection concerning the proposed nursing home, the Kennys told the Council: “As in the pantomime, we suggest that the developers are attempting to stuff an ‘Ugly Sister’s foot’ into Cinderella’s delicate slipper.”The Kennys argued that the proposal would change the character of the neighbourhood and hugely diminish the enjoyment that each householder currently has in their own property.They stated that if the nursing home is permitted, it “would detrimentally impact” on their home, which adjoins the nursing home site to the south east.The Kennys argued that the proposal “would also set a precedent that could ultimately seriously damage the character of the area”.In terms of the scale and massing of the proposal, the Kennys stated that “this proposal inserts a monolithic concrete structure effectively in the middle of back gardens of current residents adjoining the site”.The Kennys stated that it is their view that Bartra has “bought a challenging and problematic site, which requires sensitive and creative treatment”.The Kennys state that the area is made up of 11 detached houses along the lane, including Maple Tree House.On behalf of Dalkey Community Council, Dr Susan McDonnell requested that planning permission be refused “in view of our widespread concerns”.Dr McDonnell told the Council: “We have concerns about the scale, height and massing of this proposed 104-bed nursing home located in a residential area, where the surrounding buildings are mainly two storey.”The proposed nursing home rises from two to five storeys and planning documents lodged on behalf of Bartra with the application contended that the nursing home scheme will have a significantly reduced impact on the Kenny home and neighbouring properties than the permitted apartment scheme.In the documents lodged on behalf of Bartra by Thornton O’Connor Town Planning, Patricia Thornton stated that unlike the permitted scheme, there is no development in the southern portion of the site and this significantly reduces the impact of the property on the surrounding dwellings at the southern end of the site.Ms Thornton further stated that the nursing home scheme has been sensitively designed to minimise the potential impact on the residential amenity of surrounding properties.She further stated that the incorporation of design features such as a setback top floor, carefully positioned fenestration, obviated windows, no development at the southern end of the site and high-quality landscaping will ensure that the proposed development knits into the receiving environment.Ms Thornton stated that the scheme’s location close to Dalkey village and to the local Dart station will ensure that future residents have the opportunity to remain living within their community.The planning consultant added that the future residents will be provided with appropriate medical care and support while also enjoying the benefit of existing social and community infrastructure in the village.As part of her planning report lodged with the application, Ms Thornton contended that what is proposed represents a significant investment in an under-utilised infill site providing “a much-needed nursing home facility for the area”.Ms Thornton stated that the principal objective of the application is to contribute towards reducing the shortage of residential care home beds.Bartra now has four weeks in which to lodge an appeal to An Bord Pleanála.

The development comes ahead of next week’s meeting between Taoiseach Micheál Martin and US president Joe Biden, which is taking place online rather than in Washington due to the pandemic. The resolution, a draft of which has been seen by The , expresses support “for the full implementation” of the agreement and subsequent efforts “to support peace on the island of Ireland”. It also states that any new or amended trade agreements between the US and UK should take into account that the conditions of the Belfast Agreement are met. Protocol contentionThere is also mention of the Northern Ireland protocol – currently the subject of fierce contention between London and Brussels, following Britain’s move to unilaterally delay the introduction of customs checks between the North and Britain.It is expected that the resolution will be brought before the Senate early next week, in advance of St Patrick’s Day.Brexit tensionsThe resolution is being proposed by Democrat senator Bob Menendez, the chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, one of the most senior positions in Congress, and Susan Collins, a Republican senator from Maine who has been a long-standing supporter of Ireland in the Senate.There has been a renewed focus in Washington on tensions in Northern Ireland over Brexit with EU commissioner Marcos Sefcovic and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney this week briefing the Friends of Ireland caucus on Capitol Hill about Britain’s move to delay the custom checks. Separately, the British government is to send a senior official from the Northern Ireland office to Washington in an effort to set out the British perspective on the latest Brexit developments. The prominence of Irish issues on Capitol Hill comes as Washington prepares to mark St Patrick’s Day next week. Mr Martin will hold his first bilateral meeting with Mr Biden on Wednesday, while the annual Speaker’s Lunch on Capitol Hill is being replaced with a virtual event. Speaking last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Mr Biden is “unequivocal” in his support for the Belfast Agreement, following London’s surprise move to extend the grace period for post-Brexit checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain.“It has been the bedrock of peace, stability and prosperity for all the people of Northern Ireland,” Ms Psaki said of the agreement when asked about the dispute over the operation of the protocol.Under the protocol, checks should commence in April on some goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland.

Nobody seems to care. And I don’t want right-wing comedy, whatever that is. I’d just like comedy.”Mr Kumar makes no secret of his political leanings, telling a  interviewer: “I am absolutely guilty of the accusation levelled at me by furious people on the internet in that I have not got over Brexit.”The decision to axe the show after four series was first reported by The Sun. A BBC spokesperson said: “We are very proud of The Mash Report but in order to make room for new comedy shows we sometimes have to make difficult decisions, and it won’t be returning.“We would like to thank all those involved in four brilliant series and hope to work with Nish Kumar, Rachel Parris and the team in the future.”In 2019, Kumar was booed off stage for making Brexit jokes at a charity event held by the Lord’s Taverners.He was pelted with a bread roll, prompting the event host and Taverners’ ambassador, Greg James, to say the behaviour of some of the crowd was “appalling”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emperor caligulas long lost mosaic returned italy used coffee","story":"For centuries, it lay in the mud on the bed of a volcanic lake in Italy, before being dredged up in an operation ordered by Mussolini, and then illegally exported to the United States, where it ended up being used for decades as a coffee table in a Manhattan apartment.After a distinctly chequered history, a multi-coloured mosaic that adorned a vast pleasure barge built for the despotic and possibly psychotic emperor Caligula 2,000 years ago finally returned home on Thursday.The intricate mosaic, which would have been stepped on by the emperor himself during lavish parties – and possibly orgies – on board the huge vessel, was unveiled in a museum that sits on the shores of Lake Nemi, which lies in the Alban Hills south-east of Rome.The mosaic decorated the bridge of one of two barges that were recovered from the bottom of the lake between 1929 and 1932 on the express orders of Il Duce, who styled himself as a modern-day emperor and was keen to relive the glory that was Rome.The barges were huge – around 240ft long and 80ft wide – with one reputed to have included a temple to the goddess Diana.There have long been claims that a third barge may still lie on the lake bed, and the recovery of the mosaic has rekindled hopes of finding it.In order to recover the two existing barges in the 1930s, Mussolini ordered much of the lake to be dredged.The mysterious third barge could lie in a part of the lake that was not emptied. A sonar survey conducted a few years ago found no trace of it, but that does not mean it does not exist, said Emiliano Belmonte, from the town council in Nemi.“Centuries ago there was a rockslide on that side of the lake which means that the legendary third ship could be underneath it,” he told The .“The sonar wouldn’t have been able to penetrate beneath the rock. We’re considering different methods of exploring the lake. The mystery remains.”Alberto Bertucci, the mayor of Nemi, said there were reports dating back to the 15th century that a third barge could lurk under the water, with local fishermen pulling up artefacts from time to time in their nets. “There are clues that there is something there. It’s not over yet. These ships display the incredible engineering feats that the Romans were capable of.”After the barges were recovered from the lake bed during the Fascist era, they were kept in a specially-built museum on the shores of the lake.But in 1944, as the Allies pushed north in the liberation of Italy, the museum was set on fire, with suspicions that retreating German forces torched it out of spite. The wooden skeletons of the imperial barges were almost completely destroyed.The fragment of mosaic, however, survived because at the time it was kept in Rome. It was photographed in 1955 in a depository but then vanished without trace.It did not come to light again until a special unit of Italy’s Carabinieri police, which deals with cultural heritage thefts and trafficking, was tipped off that it had been illegally traded to the US and was being used as a coffee table in the New York home of an Italian couple. They said they had bought it in good faith in the 1960s from an aristocrat.The effort to recover the mosaic involved a “complex” operation in collaboration with US police and prosecutors, said Major Paolo Salvatori of the Carabinieri.The square mosaic was recovered in 2017, after which experts spent years cleaning the tea and coffee stains that had accumulated over the years.Its unveiling in the Museum of Ships on the shores of Lake Nemi was welcomed by Massimo Osanna, the director-general of Italian museums.“It’s fundamental to bring archeological artifacts like these back to their original contexts,” he said. “I’m very happy that it has finally been restored to where it came from.”Caligula’s barges were not ordinary ships, but “floating palaces”, he said. They had hot and cold running water, mosaic floors and rooms for dining and sleeping.During the recovery of the barges in the 1930s, archeologists discovered decorative bronzes in the shape of wolf’s heads, lion’s heads and the mythological figure Medusa.Caligula reigned as emperor from 37 to 41 AD, when he was assassinated by members of the Praetorian Guard.Famously eccentric, if not psychotic, he was reputed to have dressed as a woman, slept with his sisters and appointed his horse as a consul.His pleasure ships are said to have been decorated with gold, marble and purple silk.According to Suetonius, the Roman historian, Caligula’s barges featured “ten banks of oars, the poops of which blazed with jewels…(they were) filled with ample baths, galleries and saloons and supplied with a great variety of vines and fruit trees”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"living meghans truth now","story":"Just days after JFK’s assassination, Jackie Kennedy crafted a glittering fairytale about her husband’s presidency. “There will be great presidents again,” the grieving widow told Life Magazine in a now-iconic interview, “but there will never be another Camelot.”Her words soon passed into the cultural lexicon before long few remembered that the term had never been used during JFK’s tenure. The Camelot myth beguiled America for decades and resonates to this day. I was strangely reminded of it as I listened to Meghan Markle “speaking her truth” in another famous interview. Certainly, the myth-maker’s hand on the scales was more obvious this time. Instead of King Arthur and his knights, there was Disney, via the Duchess’s ham-fisted reference to The Little Mermaid. In place of Jackie’s delicate breathy tones, we had Harry’s stumbling Estuary English and Meghan’s doe-eyed Californian corporatese. Yet this was an equally calculated attempt to mythologise the couple and redefine their place in history. Alongside the fairytale references were overt parallels between the Duchess and Princess Diana – perhaps even with Princess Latifa, the captive daughter of Dubai’s royal family. Just as Jackie Kennedy dictated the terms of her interview, Oprah Winfrey proved a compliant interrogator, offering performative expressions of shock at things anyone familiar with Royal protocol would have understood. “Prince Harry’s son was not going to receive security”, laments the Duchess at one point. “Whaaat?”, replies Oprah, with slapstick incredulity. Frost-Nixon, this was not. Certain claims were instantly uncredible such as the suggestion Archie was denied the title “Prince” because he was mixed-race, or that the Archbishop of Canterbury performed an official wedding ceremony in their garden, days before the global spectacle of their Windsor nuptials. Many of the headlines used to illustrate the couple’s ‘mistreatment’ by the UK media were at best, taken out of context – at worst, outrageously misappropriated. All told, the Sussexes’ ‘truth’ bears more than a passing resemblance to Trump’s ‘alternative facts’.Very little of this seems to matter, however, in a world where ‘lived experience’ can, and often does, supersede objective reality. Questioning iniduals may expect to be accused of racism, downplaying mental health, or both. “Believe her, no matter what”, seems to be the demand – even when it doesn’t make sense. “I wasn’t interested in grandeur”, cries the woman in the $4500 dress. Like Alice through the looking glass, we are required to believe impossible things before breakfast. We must trust that an intelligent modern woman neglected to perform even a cursory google of her future husband – a prince no less – before their first date. We must lionise a couple who insist they are being kind and respectful, even as they carelessly cast suspicion around their relatives and compound the Queen’s anxieties at a traumatic time. We are expected to agree that people who are richer than Croesus, wielding vast cultural influence, are unambiguous victims. Like many born in the early nineties, I vividly recall the death of Princess Diana the relentless media coverage and months of public lamentation that followed, amid a febrile intellectual atmosphere. The car crash happened the day after my birthday. That morning, school parents flooded my mother with calls asking if the party would be cancelled out of respect many were outraged to learn it was going ahead. For all Diana’s admirable qualities, my mother simply didn’t feel a five-year-old’s birthday should be ruined to commemorate someone none of us had known personally. For this perfectly reasonable opinion, she became, for a time, the heartless bogeywoman of the school gates. In the aftermath, Princess Diana, a press-savvy woman, famously adept at manipulating the media, was soon recast as a helpless victim with little agency of her own. Now this equally savvy couple expects us to swallow a similar fiction. The simplistic herovillain narrative they propose is already winning over a global audience unfamiliar with royal convention and fresh from imbibing The Crown’s highly-coloured view of complex events.  Meanwhile, a strange inversion is underway in Britain. Paid-up progressives, often avowed republicans, are now demanding supplication towards this gilded couple. The Daily Star, reacting in the UK\u0027s finest anti-deferential traditions, ridiculed the pair in a series of hilarious newspaper covers, worthy of Hogarth or Gillray. Predictably, the paper stands accused of bullying, along with much of the UK media.Many viewers will, like me, have believed and been moved by some of the Sussexes’ claims, while doubting others, and becoming so enraged in places it was tempting to take a hammer to the TV set. Piers Morgan didn’t believe a word of it, and said so now he has been sacked from his job, apparently following a personal intervention from the Sussexes. What is that if not a form of extraordinary privilege?As the interview winds down, Oprah congratulates the couple on their lucky escape. “It has a happy ending because you made it so”, she trills.“Greater than any fairytale you’ve ever read”, gushes Meghan, while the doubters reach for their sick-bags. I’m not convinced either. The Sussex fairytale lacked the elegiac beauty of Camelot, and inflicted greater collateral damage. Their ‘happy ending’ – such that it is – has come at the expense of rational thought, while undermining an institution beloved by millions. But from now on, expect much more of this self-serving jargon as the Sussexes continue their audition for the role of global #BeKind ambassadors.

It’s an official video about the Chancellor’s first year in the Treasury, now viewed a million times on social media. An envious No10 has responded with its own film: a Mission Impossible about how Boris Johnson and his team procured a vaccine against unthinkable odds.Their film isn’t ready yet but No10 has released a trailer, with Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance given starring roles. There’s a dramatic backdrop, rousing music – and an obvious problem. It’s not clear to anyone how this ends.After locking us all down, these gentlemen certainly have a captive audience for their videos – who, under the roadmap, have plenty time to watch things at home. And this is the point. In spite of all of this success, not just procuring but inventing Covid vaccines, Brits are still stuck under one of the most stringent lockdowns in the developed world. And denied any of the vaccine idends being offered abroad.Vaccinated Americans have been told they can now meet each other indoors, given how unlikely they are to catch or pass on the virus. No such latitude for the fully-vaccinated Brits. Israel has reopened, with Tel Aviv cafes now buzzing.It’s not as if Britain still has dangerously high virus levels: ours are almost the lowest in Europe. Ministers have been astonished at how few pupils tested positive in the lateral flow tests deployed for school reopenings this week. But the Prime Minister set his earliest date for a full reopening – June 21 – before any of this was apparent.His No10 narrative is simple: stay at home. We’re almost there. Let’s keep going: just three more months and we can all get back to normal. But this isn’t quite right.When Britain reopens, we can expect a third wave of Covid. It won’t be nearly as big, thanks to the vaccines. But not everyone will be protected and no jab is 100 per cent effective. So we should expect more illness, hospitalisation and Covid deaths. Then, perhaps, panic – and pressure for a fourth lockdown.The scientists are trying to talk about this risk, even if politicians are in denial. Earlier this week, Whitty warned MPs not to think that Covid “just goes away” after lockdown with “no further deaths”. Whitty’s models may have a bad reputation by now but less pessimistic models from Bristol University show the same thing: deaths falling away to almost nothing, but rising markedly over the summer once commuting, parties and festivals start. Next winter, it’s quite possible that Covid is as bad as flu.It will then be the job of Whitty and Vallance to explain why all this is tolerable, as long as the new cases don’t overwhelm the health service (which, with all these vaccinations, they shouldn’t). It will be a very difficult message for them to deliver: that Britain has to learn (or relearn) how to live with the risk. Not out of callousness or obsession with money, but from an acknowledgment that it’s lives vs lives. Going back to lockdowns would inflict harm that, this time, would far outweigh the benefits.Much of Europe is already edging in this direction. Bookshops and barbers have reopened in France, clothes shops have reopened in Denmark. Neighbours can now meet for dinner in Germany. All of these countries have more Covid than Britain (Germany has just announced a third wave) but they take the view that stricter lockdown would inflict more pain than was acceptable.Everyone knows that lockdowns are a tradeoff. But to say so, now, has become borderline heresy in Westminster. As I understand it, the Cabinet has never been briefed about the cost of the current lockdown – on mental health, cancer diagnosis or financial tradeoffs. For example, we’re told that nurses can’t be given a decent pay rise because there’s no money: it would cost about £200 million a year. A single day of lockdown costs far more than this. To govern is to choose.If we had a functioning Labour Party there would be plenty of causes for it to champion. We know, from last time, what lockdown does: the NSPCC says calls to its child abuse hotline rose by 49 per cent. Alcohol deaths rose by 16 per cent.Then there is the horrendous backlog in criminal court cases: it has a huge impact, not least in leaving criminals at large. Police are in despair over all this: one senior officer recently told me that many rape cases are now unlikely to be heard for years. It’s a growing emergency, receiving hardly any attention. We can add to this thousands of undiagnosed cancer cases, the 800 million lost school days and the collapse of rehabilitation in prisons.The US decision to allow vaccinated people (mainly pensioners) to meet again is driven by scientific knowledge that loneliness kills as surely as Covid: the unvisited elderly are more likely to succumb to Alzheimer’s or other diseases. Ministers will need to talk about all this when they come to lift lockdown.But for now, Johnson’s problem isn’t too much bad news: it’s too much good news. The vaccine has been even more successful that was hoped for at the beginning of the year. The real-world evidence from Israel shows the figure for Pfizer in trials – 95 per cent – was too pessimistic: it’s come in closer to 97 per cent. Oxford is not far behind. The vaccine effect on transmission, too, seems extraordinary: which may help explain collapsing cases in Britain. So it’s easy to see why No10 is itching to tell its good news story, or make the film that it understandably feels should be shown to the world.The scientists did their job. But politicians need to do theirs: this won’t just mean making proper use of the vaccine opportunity but being honest about how tough things will still be in months ahead.Just as lockdown posed tradeoffs, so will reopening. So perhaps the Prime Minister might want to wait a while before releasing the final version of his movie: it may be quite some time before he can declare anything resembling triumph.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national trust vows continue investigating contentious slavery","story":"The National Trust has vowed to continue pursuing the “contentious” history of its properties as it is cleared of breaking charity law for including Winston Churchill in a report on colonialism and slavery.Despite facing backlash from members, director general Hilary McGrady has argued that the Trust is “at its best” when it captures the “complexity” of their historical places and vowed to continue a “retain and explain” approach.Her comments came as the Charity Commission ruled that the Trust could have done more to communicate with its members over the report but there “are no grounds for regulatory action”.The regulator said that it welcomed “the charity’s commitment to learning lessons”. However, in a blog released at the same time as the commission\u0027s report, Ms McGrady appeared defiant.The charity, which has faced increasing backlash in recent years over its perceived woke agenda, faced fury from members after publishing a report in September which listed Churchill\u0027s Chartwell residence, seen below, alongside those of slavers because he was a former Colonial Secretary.It was accused at its AGM of pursuing a “witch hunt into the lives of past property owners” and “defaming” the memory of the former prime minister.After being cleared by regulators on Thursday, Ms McGrady told “staff, volunteers and supporters” that “before we move forward” she wanted to set out where she stood on “researching and sharing the history of the places in our care”.In a blog post, which adds “For all history” to the beginning of the Trust’s motto “for everyone, for ever”, she writes: “It is our history in its entirety that makes us who we are as nations and as people…“There is so much to be proud of in our history. The wonderful collection of places the Trust cares for, that have been cherished for generations before us, is a testament to that.“However, history can also be challenging and contentious. It is surely a sign of confidence, integrity and pride that while we can celebrate and enjoy history we can also explore and acknowledge all aspects of it.“The National Trust is at its best when we capture this complexity – when we present facts and material evidence in ways that inspire curiosity, inquiry, learning and sharing.”Ms McGrady noted that they had had thousands of responses to the report, some expressing “genuine concern for some supporters” but said they published it “to be transparent and factual”.She said that in the future they “must continue to take a wide-ranging and evidence-based approach to history” and “work hard to place particular themes, such as historic slavery and colonialism in a broad context”.She said that they would continue to “support a ‘retain and explain’ approach to history”.The Charity Commission said that controversy over the original report “required examination because they had the potential to damage significantly the charity’s reputation and undermine trust and confidence in charities more widely”.But the regulator concluded that the Trust had carefully considered the charities aims and consulted members before publishing the report, and therefore had not acted outside its charitable purpose.The commission did conclude they could have “done more to clearly explain the link between the report and the Trust’s purpose.In  a blog post Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission, said that despite not breaking the law the Trust “found itself in the middle of a storm”.She added: “It has responded by making a concerted effort to listen to and engage with its critics. And it has reassured us that it will learn from its recent experience, and will remain mindful of the opposing views and erse opinions within its membership and wider society.”She said that she hoped to reassure those “concerned that the charity had lost its way, that the Commission has examined the Trust’s actions very closely”.But she warned that charities should be “thoughtful about the impact of their actions on their supporters and the public more widely and consider any likely concerns or controversy before they act”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"need look outside see no ones obeying ban kids playing friends","story":"If you go to any playground at the moment, you will find yourself surrounded by law-breakers. Their bulging pockets contain nothing more sinister than wet wipes and overpackaged fruit snacks, and their behaviour is not anti-social. On the contrary, their crime is to be – or rather, to allow their children to be – social.Even now, with spring sprung, schools open and infection rates plummeting, this remains illegal. Children over five in England have been banned from playing with friends, even outdoors, since January. For those of us who were living under Tier 3 rules last year, the ban has been in place for six months. That is an eternity in child years.It is also, as my own children were quick to note, “sooooo unfair”. Throughout lockdown, two adults from different households have been allowed to meet outside for exercise. But children – who need exercise just as much, if not more, and who get it best from running about with friends – can’t meet up on their own. Siblings may provide a grudging substitute for some, but what about the 46 per cent of British families who only have one child?It’s so unfair that it may amount to illegal discrimination, according to children’s rights advocates. In a letter to Boris Johnson this week, campaigners pointed out that the current law disproportionately impacts children and single parents. (It’s much harder for single parents to meet a friend for exercise if they can’t bring their kids along.) It could therefore be contested under the 2010 Equality Act.Another, perhaps even more pressing, reason to ditch this law is that parents are no longer willing to obey it. Mass outbreaks of criminality are occurring in broad daylight: playdates shiftily agreed on street corners “childcare bubbles” swollen to bursting point children of suspiciously similar height tearing around the park together in great murmurations of joy. Any law that is routinely and conspicuously broken sets a bad precedent. When it’s broken by parents – normally so rule-based and cautious – you can be sure its time is up.Amy Sayers, a pub landlady from West Yorkshire, has spent lockdown creating a miniature version of her pub, The Swan. Decorated with paints and offcuts from the real pub, it is a perfect replica – from its flagstone floor to its stacked glasses and teeny-tiny beer pumps.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"president xi sowing seeds destruction","story":"China’s “Parliament” yesterday approved Xi Jinping’s proposal that, in future, the Chinese government will decide who can stand for election to Hong Kong’s legislature. They thereby destroyed what is left of Hong Kong’s political freedom. In what must have been a nail-biting vote, the National People’s Congress approved the measure by 2,895 to 0. The brave people of Hong Kong will, in future, see their own local parliament reduced to such a hollow farce.The harsh reality is that the Chinese government has the power to do whatever it likes regarding Hong Kong. But it is destroying the goose that has been laying the golden eggs for the last 60 years. As Hong Kong becomes indistinguishable from mainland China, the great international companies that flocked there because it practised the rule of law will, in future, move their businesses to, or set up in, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan or elsewhere.Xi likes to suggest to the world that it is Chinese communism that has transformed China into an economic superpower over the past 20 years and that this justifies the party’s dictatorship over the people. Such a claim is demonstrable nonsense. China would have been where it is now 40 years ago but for communist economics, the Cultural Revolution and the so-called Great Leap Forward. We know that because China is only now catching up with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which became economic successes in the Sixties and Seventies and are still far more prosperous. Nor did they have to surrender their liberty in order to achieve economic growth. Indeed, the people of South Korea and Taiwan overthrew dictatorships on their march to both prosperity and freedom.However, the tragedy of Hong Kong does not exist in isolation. Xi is not as bad as Chairman Mao but he has imposed more surveillance and control over the Chinese people than at any time since the demise of the Great Helmsman.Hong Kong is, moreover, only one facet of his increasingly aggressive policy. The Uighurs, in the west of China, are facing a degree of persecution that amounts to cultural genocide. All of China’s Asian neighbours are being bullied by Beijing. Taiwan is threatened with invasion and India has had soldiers killed on the Chinese-Indian border. China has antagonised the countries of south-east Asia, including communist Vietnam, by occupying and militarising islets in the South China Sea. Japan and South Korea have rejected Chinese claims to islands which are part of their territory.Inidually, these provocations are difficult to resist. But the effect of this behaviour is that all of China’s neighbours, together with Australia and the United States, are coming together to contain Beijing. India, which remained non-aligned throughout the Cold War and never split with the Soviet Union, has now joined with the United States, Japan and Australia in an unprecedented “Quad” (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue), which is meeting today to discuss how to resist Chinese aggression.The Pacific and the Indian Oceans are no longer separate. We now have the Indo-Pacific geopolitical region, which combines all the countries resisting Xi’s foreign policy.Xi is strong enough to ensure that he can achieve short-term gains by throwing China’s weight around. But he is a poor strategist who is causing deep harm to China’s long-term interests.Many in China, including in the Communist Party, and perhaps some in the Politburo, must be asking what is so clever about uniting all of China’s Asian neighbours – from Tokyo, through south-east Asia to Delhi – with the United States and Australia, to work and plan together to contain the People’s Republic?Deng Xiaoping, when he ruled China 40 years ago, warned his successors not to throw their weight around and bully their neighbours when China became economically powerful.Xi is ignoring that advice. In doing so he threatens and undermines the future of his own country. He may also be undermining himself.

But every time he goes to put another log on the wood burner in a corner of his living room, it intensifies into a single, drawn-out cacophony.The locally felled timber was exposed to the radiation that escaped from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, less than 40 miles to the south-east, when three of the plant’s reactors suffered melt-downs after the March 2011 earthquake and the tsunami that it unleashed on coastal regions of north-east Japan.The plume of radiation passed directly over Mr Ito’s home, on the outskirts of the town of Iitate, leaving an invisible but very dangerous dusting on everything that it came in contact with.A decade on from the second-worst nuclear accident in history, he says the radioactivity collects in the ashes from his wood-fired stove, as well as in the metal of the burner and the silvered flue that rises through the roof. He shrugs.Of the 6,500 residents of this picturesque community, 76-year-old Mr Ito was one of just nine people who defied the government’s strongly worded request to evacuate. Since the evacuation order was lifted, around 1,500 have returned. To Mr Ito\u0027s dismay, the town of Iitate now wants to fill its remaining properties abandoned for years to slow decay. And with more than 70 per cent of the residents now of retirement age, the town is desperate for an injection of youth.Some have already arrived. Among the 150 newcomers to have trickled slowly in are Yuki Hanai and her husband, Junichiro, who came to set up a flower farm because of the cheap availability of land.“My husband was more worried than I was, but I told him that the mayor and the local government say it is safe and I trust them”, she said. “We decided that after living in the city, it would be a good place for children to grow up, in the countryside with lots of fresh air around.”The Hanais have three children, aged 8, 7 and 3, and the family has taken up walking in the local hills and along the picturesque rivers at weekends.“People have driven past us in cars and looked at us as if we were mad, but this is the life we want to lead”, she said.Last year, the children grew vegetables in the garden of their refurbished home and they ate them with their meals, Mrs Hanai said, although there have been times when the water from the taps has been murky and they went to the local supermarket to buy bottled water.“I must admit that I do always look at the electronic signs that are around the town showing the radiation levels and I get a little worried when the numbers are high, but most of the time they are pretty low so I have nothing to worry about”, she said. “And so far, none of us have felt any effects of being here. I’m not too worried”.There is much scientific debate over a level of radiation exposure that is safe for humans, with one study by the World Health Organisation suggesting that there is a 70 per cent higher risk of thyroid cancer in girls in areas affected by the fallout from the Fukushima plant, as well as a 7 per cent higher risk of leukemia in males and 6 per cent higher likelihood of breast cancer.Nevertheless, generous subsidies are on offer to anyone who wants to move to Iitate. Land or a property has to be bought, although prices are low, while the city will pay Y200,000 (GBP1,332) to cover moving costs, up to Y5 million (GBP33,322) to build a new house, as much as Y2 million (GBP13,329) to buy a vacant property or cover a maximum of Y20,000 (GBP133) a month in rent for up to two years.In addition, the prefectural government provides up to Y2 million (GBP13,329) to buy a house in the village or to remodel an unoccupied property. In addition, children have free health care up to the age of 18.Whatsmore, Iitate happens to sit in stunning mountains and forest, and was named as the 12th most beautiful village in Japan a couple of years before the disaster. Abandoned farmhouses dotted around the town are being renovated and turned into venues for artists and writers, while others are being used for people working remotely during the coronavirus pandemic. Other plans call for a creativity hub and a community made from shipping containers.Nana Matsumoto, 28, is one of the youngest to have already made the move to Iitate, where she is now employed by the council to attract more young people.  “Immediately after I joined the town hall in 2019, we were just trying to get the message out that people could come back to Iitate, that people were living here again and that we intended to rebuild the community”, she said.Money from the national government has gone into a new fire station, a new police headquarters, a school and a large commercial facility, while roads throughout the community are being repaved.The town\u0027s new mayor, Makoto Sugioka, a 44-year-old former Buddhist priest who, by chance, studied nuclear physics at the Tokyo Institute of Technology says the older population needed little persuading to help rebuild the community.“I have spoken to people who were children here during the war years and immediately after the war ended, when things were really hard, and they have told me that if they were able to get through that, then there is no way that they are going to be defeated by a natural disaster”, he said. “They simply have a very deep love for their hometown”.Asked whether families are not being put off because of the possible effects of radiation on their health, Mr Sugioka insists that is not their primary concern.“The people who want to come here to live and work are open-minded about the situation”, he said.Mr Ito disagrees. In his time holding the fort, he has carefully monitored contamination levels in the wild vegetables and fruit that grow in the mountains surrounding the town and charted figures that change with the seasons, the wind, the rainfall.He unclips his geiger counter and holds it over a plastic bag of wild mushrooms he picked nearby this morning. Once again, the crackling intensifies.The valleys, paddy fields and tumbling streams here are still not safe, Mr Ito insists.The view from Mr Ito’s front porch is of a series of fallow paddy fields that rise into a steep-sided valley. Snow caps the mountains in the far distance. Soon the white egrets will return to the stream that winds along the valley bottom.“This is not a place where humans should be living”, he says. “The government has cleaned less than 16 percent of the areas that were affected by the radiation. Caesium has a half-life of 30 years, so it will take 330 years before levels here return to normal.“If you look at the numbers, there is only one conclusion it’s not safe to be here”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"furloughed women work longer men says study","story":"Furlough has disproportionately affected women, academics at King\u0027s College London have concluded.Once furloughed, women were without work for longer periods than men, according to research by the Global Institute for Women\u0027s Leadership.The researchers at King\u0027s College said that women have been losing out under the furlough scheme, contributing to fears that they have worse job and financial security than men.As a result, they warned that the job retention scheme may not be doing enough to address the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis on women.The warning comes on the heels of data published by the Office for National Statistics that show that during the pandemic, women have been more likely to be furloughed, have spent significantly less time working from home and have spent more time on unpaid household work and childcare.Read more: Furlough extension: when the scheme will end and how to claim your payCaroline Nokes MP, who chairs the Commons women and equalities committee, has called on the Government to ensure women were included in its drive to build back better.Last July, around a third of women who had been furloughed had not worked since March, compared with 20 per cent of men, the KCL report found.Women who had been on furlough were also more likely to fear losing their jobs and had worse projected financial security, the study indicated.Dr Rose Cook, senior research fellow at the institute, said: The furlough scheme has undoubtedly prevented mass job losses. However, our results suggest that in 2020, once furloughed, women were disproportionately furloughed for longer periods and had worse perceived job and financial security than their male peers.Gender-sensitive policymaking is needed to prevent women losing out even further than they already have from the impacts of the pandemic.A Treasury spokesman said: We\u0027ve made sure the furlough scheme supports women\u0027s specific needs - working parents are able to be furloughed for childcare reasons and we\u0027ve ensured women will not lose their statutory maternity pay if furloughed.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers make startling u turn","story":"NewsMinisters make startling U-turn over Cumbria coal mine ahead of climate talksCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick called in West Cumbria Minings plans to open a deep mine near Whitehaven because the application has raised issues of \"more than local importance\"mirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAR NewsWhitehaven, near where WCM plan to open a deep mine \"Get weekly email updates on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In a letter to Cumbria County Council, the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Governmentsaid Mr Jenrick believed the application had raised issues of more than local importance. It said he had decided that a public inquiry should be held to explore the arguments put forward by both supporters and opponents of the proposal by West Cumbria Miningto open the deep mine near Whitehaven. It follows intense pressure by scientists and campaigners who warned it would undermine the Governmentaposs hopes of progress when it hosts the international Cop climate change talks in Glasgow later this year. Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Tony Bosworth said it was a startling, but very welcome U-turn after ministers had previously resisted calls to intervene in the application. It was not possible for the Government to maintain, as it claimed only two months ago, that this was just a matter of local importance and the decision will now rightly be taken at national level, he said. However the decision is likely to dismay some northern Tory MPs who were banking on the project to bring much-needed jobs and investment to the region. Workington MP Mark Jenkinson accused ministers of a capitulation to climate change alarmists. This represents a risk to signicant private sector investment in Cumbria and the Governmentaposs aposlevelling upapos agenda, he said. The announcement came after the council said last month it would reconsider the application by WCM to mine for coking coal for use in steel production. The move prompted the company to declare last week that it was lodging papers with the High Court to commence judicial review proceedings.

Ms Phillips said: In this place we count what we care about. We count vaccines done, we count the number of people on benefits, we rule or oppose based on a count. And we obsessively track that data. We love to count data about our own popularity. However we donapost currently count dead women. No current study is done into the patterns every year and the data of victims who are killed, die by suicide or die suddenly. Dead women is a thing that weaposve all just accepted as part of our daily lives. Dead women is just one of those things. Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common. After reading the list, Ms Phillips added: Her name rings out across all our media. We have all prayed that the name of Sarah Everard would never be on any list. Letaposs pray every day and work every day to make sure nobodyaposs name ends up on this list again. Conservative former minister Maria Miller opened the Commons debate by paying a tribute to Sarah Everard. Mrs Miller told MPs: I want to start by sending my thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of Sarah Everard who are going through such a painful time. Her abduction has sent shockwaves across the UK. Sarah did everything to avoid danger and, letaposs be very clear, women are not the problem here. But for many women this news story will bring back memories of threatening situations they have found themselves in through no fault of their own being sexually harassed on the streets, walking home from meeting friends, anonymous threats of physical violence on social media, sexually assaulted in plain sight in rush hour on public transport on the way to work. She added: Many choose not to talk about this, choose not to report it for fear of not being believed or taken seriously - but the research shows these sorts of events are parts of womenaposs everyday le and that is why what happened to Sarah Everard feels so very close to home. Mrs Miller added: We should not accept a culture of violence towards women, we should not be complicit in covering it up and we need to give women effective mechanisms to report what happens, to expose the scale of the problem, to call it out publicly and to punish those who perpetrate this culture of fear. But Labour former minister and Mother of the House Harriet Harman criticised Dame Cressida Dickaposs comments on Ms Everardaposs disappearance. Ms Harman said: This International Womenaposs Day debate comes in the shadow of the menace of male violence against women. She continued: Women will find no reassurance at all in the politan Commissioneraposs statement that, and I quote, aposit is extremely rare for a woman to be abducted off the streetapos. Women know abduction and murder is just the worst end of a spectrum of everyday male threat to women.

The rules in England will not permit that. The Prime Ministeraposs road map says that for the weeks after March , people should minimise travel, there are to be no holidays, and people wonapost be allowed to stay away from home overnight. If it wonapost be safe to stay overnight in England, then obviously it would not be safe for people to travel into Wales. Wales will move to a stay local requirement for at least the next three weeks as the country eases some of its coronavirus restrictions, Mr Drakeford will announce today. The current stay-at-home restrictions will be lted from Saturday and are expected to allow people from rural areas to travel greater distances than those who live in urban towns and cities. From Saturday, four people from two households will also be able to meet outdoors to socialise, including in gardens - while outdoor sports facilities, including basketball courts, tennis courts and golf courses, can reopen. Indoor care home visits will also restart for single designated visitors from the weekend. Hairdressers and barbers can reopen for appointments from Monday, the same day that all primary pupils and those in qualications years canto schools.  Secondary schools will have the option to bring year  and  learners back, while there will be flexibility to allow all other pupils to check-in with teachers on a limited amount of days ahead of a fullafter the Easter break. Non-essential retail, which was considered for reopening from next week, will start to reopen gradually from March , while restrictions will be lted on what can be sold in shops which are currently open. All shops, including all close contact services, will be able to open from April , the same date as in England. Mr Drakeford insisted ing children and young people to face-to-face education is the top priority for the Welsh Government. He told BBC Breakfast that about % of children in Wales were back in school, with that figure rising considerably from Monday when all primary school pupils and students taking exams in secondary schools will . All students in Wales will be back in classrooms on April . That is the safe way to do it, that is what we have agreed with our teaching unions and local education authorities, Mr Drakeford said. And in the meantime, it does give us a bit of headroom to do some other modest things - the reopening of hairdressers and barbers, theof visits to care homes, allowing four people from two households to meet more outdoors. So thataposs a balance weaposve struck in Wales, a phasedto school, a phasedto business, a phasedto personal le. And he said he had anxieties about the resumption of foreign travel from as early as May .  Mr Drakeford told BBC Breakfast that September  was a dficult month in Wales as people ed to the country from holidays abroad and brought Covid- with them. I do not want to see all the hard work that people in Wales have put in over recent weeks being undermined by the reimportation of the virus, he said. The Prime Ministeraposs road map for England is very clear that these are indicative dates and when Iaposve raised this with UK ministers they always emphasise that the decision would be made in the circumstances much closer to the time. I am saying that for me, that does look early. I would want to be completely confident that we are not running the risk of a reimportation of the virus, particularly now that we know there are new iants of this virus in other parts of the world. Businesses that will be affected by ongoing restrictions will be supported by an additional £ million from the Welsh Government. Mr Drakeford is expected to say: We are taking a phased approach to unlocking each sector - starting with schools. We will make step-by-step changes each week to gradually restore freedoms. We will monitor each change we make, so we know what impact each change has had on Walesapos public health situation.

The numbers of women abducted by a total stranger are small. But the fear that you could be one of them looms large. Every day, thousands of women across the country make similar calculations to those that Sarah presumably made. They change their clothes and wear trainers so they can runthe need to. They grip keys in their fist. They assess every man they come across. They take the longer route because itaposs better lit and thereaposs more traffic, or houses where they could urgently knock on the door. Friends are on speed dial and promised a text the moment theyaposre safely home.The risk is low, but most women have a story of unwanted attention or harassment or even abuse by a man on the streets. Many are questioning whether they should have to put up with it - and what more the police, the Government and society can do. Here seven women MPs from across the political parties share their experiences. Caroline Noakes Tory MP for Romsey and Southampton North, Chair of the Women and Equalities Select Committee  Very few women are abducted by a complete stranger - fact. But it’s also a fact that when I walk to my flat at night I do it with my keys in my hand, ready to poke any would be assailant’s eye out. Of course I understand the men I pass on Westminster Bridge are not all potential attackers, but I don’t know which one might be. I remember the occasion in Southampton Parkway Station car park, in the dark, when a man followed me up  flights of stairs. Questioning why he was matching me step for step. Why hadn’t he got the lt  Why hadn’t I got the lt  And the relief at floor  when he commented he wasn’t following me. He shouldn’t have had to say it, but thank God he did, because I was already weighing up my handbag and how hard I would have to swing it to give him a good clonk round the head and run. I did the Krav Maga course in Parliament, with fellow female parliamentarians and staffers. I wear my trainers into and out of work with pride, despite the comments that, “your legs look better when you wear heels”. They might, I neither know nor care, I can’t run in heels.Bell Ribeiro-AddyLabour MP for Streatham and Sarah Everardaposs local MP I’ve lived in the area where Sarah went missing my whole le. When I heard that’s where she’d disappeared, my heart sank. Part of the issue is transport. To get back to where she is, she’d have to take two buses so it makes sense to cut across. I remember having to do that walk when I was a bit younger and feeling scared. I would stay on the phone to a friend of mine called Mark for  to  minutes. I’d be yapping away and he’d be tracking me - ‘are you turning onto this road now’. And we’d talk until I got to my door. People have followed me, trying to talk to me. I had a neighbour with some mental health problems so he would throw stuff at me. People shouting horrible stuff to youyou don’t want to talk to them. People driving quite slowly next to you in the car that’s really threatening. It’s so horrible to think that we have to think about what we’re doing all the time as women we have to change our behaviour we are the ones that have to take extra responsibility. That being a woman in itself means you’re under threat. It’s beyond unfair and it’s not a way to live - we should be free to walk those streets. I’d say to men,you see a woman walking late at night and she might feel uncomfortable, the man might cross the road, so she doesn’t feel like someone is gaining behind her. We’ve been told when we were younger, ‘someone’s trying to chat you up’ - but late at night is not the time to attempt to engage with a woman, when she’s walking home all alone. It’s a very selfish thing to do. Layla Moran Lib Dem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon  I’ve walked the roads Sarah Everard walked that tragic night. So much about her seems so familiar. In her beanie hat, phone to her ear rather than with headphones. I wonderedshe was holding it like that to visibly show someone is listening who will call for help. I know I’ve done that. When I was  the mother of Suzy Lamplugh came to speak to my school. What she told us stayed with me. Stay alert and don’t listen to music. Tell people where you are. I often share my live location on Whatsapp. Work out your exitsyou have to run. If I am alone and I hear footsteps behind me, I will often cross the street. If I’m feeling very scared I will make a phonecall and hold my keys in my hand in case I need them. I don’t do that every time, but it has been more than a few times in my le. Many men online have been asking what they can do to help women feel safe. My simplest advice is just cross the road, oryou can’t then perhaps stop and wait a moment rather than overtake. I can guarantee you’ll be silently thanked. Hannah BardellSNP MP for Livingston I have a very vivid memory of crossing that ide from childhood into puberty. I remember when I was a teenager I got flashed, when I was about , when I was out running. I ran all the way home and told my mum and the police came. In London, I was assaulted in a pub. A guy grabbed my boob and I threw my drink on him. One time when I was living in Woolwich, before I was an MP, a guy followed me off a bus. He had been staring at me on the bus and I stopped as I got off the bus and told the driver, but he was really dismissive. The guy started matching me step for step across the road until we reached the square, where there were people but I knew I had a deserted road to cross. So I just screamed at him in a really broad Scottish accent and he ran off. But I walked home shaking. As MPs we can take a taxi after pm but even sometimes getting out of the taxi, youaposre a bit worried. Now Iaposm older, I feel a bit more streetwise, a bit more like I would be totally prepared for it. Truth is you can never be prepared and we shouldn’t feel like we have to be. But Iaposve been in situations, definitely, where Iaposve had my phone out and close to me, on the tube when itaposs just been one or two guys or itaposs been a lonely station or a lonely road. Weaposve all done it. The Sarah Everard case, itaposs just hit so many of us. Sort of like a mini Me Too moment. Weaposre all like, yep, this is every single one of us. Anybody that has a daughter, anybody that has a son needs to be thinking I need to make sure my son never does anything like that. Young guys can be vulnerable as well but the vast majority of the time itaposs women. I wear my bracelet and personal alarm sometimes, but even that in itself, are we saying women should go about with personal alarms in their hands and keys in their hands and not wear certain things. How much does your le get limited, just to create space for violent men  Rosena Allin-Khan Labour MP for Tooting and Shadow Mental Health Minister  Walking the long way home just so you walk a brighter, busier path. Calling your mum, partner, mates or even faking a conversationno one picks up, just to scare people off. Making sure your phone has enough battery to last you getting home in case you need to call for help. Having flats in your bag to make sure you can run away that bit faster. Knowing that your daughters will have to pick up these tips because the world still isnapost safe enough for any woman to walk home alone in the dark. My heart goes out to Sarahaposs family - she is all of us. Tracey Crouch Tory MP for Chatham and Aylesford  As the days get shorter so does the window of opportunity for women to pop in some headphones, put on a motivational podcast or some appropriate beats, and go for a lone jog or walk. The me time we need in our lives is snatched away from us because the early darkness overwhelms many, including me, with fear. Our response is to either do nothing or to adapt our routes to the more polluted but better lit streets. Outside of cities this means even fewer options and so it has often been the case that I feel less safe in my own village where the streets have limited lighting, and no-one is out after dark than I did when I lived in London. For her family and friends, I am deeply shocked and devastated by the murder of Sarah Everard but for women around the country I am also appalled by the police’s “stay at home” message. Our physical wellbeing is already at risk because of the shorter days, but please don’t make us even more frightened of the dark than we already are – instead make the streets safer and punish those who commit crimes against us.

The Welsh pubaposs owners have been told to dismantle the feature following a planning dispute. The Swansea boozer had built the dome out the back of the premises to host up to  punters at a time.But a planning inspector has said it must come down because the structure was aposunauthorised,apos according to Wales Online. Who do you think is in the right here  Share your views in the comments below... The owners of City Bar, St Thomas, had been served with an enforcement notice by Swansea Council more than a year ago requiring them to take down the unauthorised structure within two months. There was a right to appeal, which was taken up by owner Ernest Joyce, of City Eat Drink Enjoy Ltd, Mr Joyce set out to prove that the dome had been substantially completed for a period of four years before the notice was issued. Enforcement action, according to planning law, canapost be taken after four years. There was agreement by all concerned that a dome was built at City Bar by April, , which was more than four years before the enforcement notice.  But aerial photographs submitted by the council in  showed substantial parts of the dome removed. Mr Joyce said parts of the timber-framed dome were dismantled and put back together over the years to make it better withstand extremes in temperature and rainfall. Welsh Government-appointed planning inspector Aidan McCooey said construction work continued in , prior to an internal fit-out and the dome being brought into use in . He said this meant it did fall foul of the four-year enforcement rule. The photographic evidence, the appellant’s evidence and what I observed of the construction at the site visit, leads me to conclude that the dome was not substantially complete in December, , said his decision report.  But Mr McCooey extended the time frame to take down the dome from two months to four months.Mr Joyce had argued that six months was more appropriate, given the backlog faced by builders due to the coronavirus pandemic. The council felt that three months would be sufficient.The y planning dispute had involved a petition at one stage in support of the dome, which was signed by more than  people. Speaking in , joint City Bar owner Marc Strydom said around £, had been invested in the premises - formerly The Windsor Arms - to make it a more attractive destination.

The campaign is aimed at rallying society to encourage girls to stay in sports because the benefits of their participation go far beyond the field or court. Figures show  per cent of teenage girls are feeling more anxious about their future than they did before the pandemic. And research of , girls aged - revealed sports participation can help change that, with  per cent of girls currently playing sport saying it has helped them feel more confident about their future development. The study, commissioned by Always, found the benefits for girls in sports go far beyond the cheers and the wins. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section Women polled who played sports during puberty say doing so helped them build skills such as learning how to work as a teamand developing self-esteemwhich have benefitted them in adult le. In addition to participating in regular exercise and having fun, sports helped them develop important le skills including learning how to win and lose , persevereand become a better communicator . Another quarter also believed sports helped their mental health. Rachel Riley, speaking on behalf of Always which has teamed up with Sported, the UKaposs largest community sporting network, said: I played so many dferent sports at school, from hurdles to football and the skills I learned helped me in so many ways.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  The biggest impact sport had was on my confidence, especially as a teen - it taught me to be more vocal and encouraged me to take the lead and this is something that has stayed with me in my adult le. Iaposm really passionate about this partnership because I believe that playing sport has many unexpected benefits, including being able to build relationships with team members, improving communication skills and most of all, it really boosts confidence. And as someone who has reaped the rewards of staying in sports when I was younger, I really want to make sure that girls are encouraged to do the same because sport can help fuel girlsapos futures. However, despite all the value sports participation provides, nearly one in three girls will drop out of sports during puberty, because they either donapost think theyaposre good enoughor donapost feel encouraged to keep playing . The survey via OnePoll also found that half of women who dropped out of sports as teens wish they had continued to play.With sports looking a little dferent right now, even more support and encouragement is needed.In fact,  per cent of girls want more support to keep them involved in sports.Sported, the UKaposs largest network of community sports groups, reported that  per cent of community groups are not sure that their participants willin the future. Always will be donating to Sported to help hire youth centre spaces and equipment to ensure the organisation is equipped to support participants once lockdown eases.  To help show the nation that the value of sports extends beyond the field, a video has been created showing the unexpected ways sports can transform her future.

Retired banker Charles Pole, , had hoped to move into a newly-built bungalow in his garden and sell his house. But that is on hold since builders found the remains of a long-lost -year-old bishop’s palace under his lawn. Now, under planning conditions, he must pay for the archaeological dig. He says he is facing a £, bill after the -year-old Bishopaposs Palace was found under his lawn. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section The ruins of wall foundations and floor deposits in Wiveliscombe, Somerset, are believed part of a bishop’s palace complex from the th century. The ancient building was in ruins by the th Century and then disappeared. For  years historians have been baffled as to its whereabouts, believing it was at another site nearby. Charles, who lives in aptly-named Palace Gardens, said: “When the builder saw the remains, he was ordered to stop work. “It came as a big surprise. It was exciting to hear the site contains something of real signicance, but the cost of the investigation is going to cost me around £, and has delayed the bungalow. “I’m pleased they found it, but I’m also not pleased because they’ve held up the build.” He estimates the dig, redesigning foundation plans, building costs and extra materials will comes to roughly £,.

The mum-of-one is a victim of torture, suffers major depression and PTSD and requires urgent psychiatric treatment, according to a charity which commissioned a detailed medical assessment of her. Human rights group Redress said it based its categorisation of Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe as a torture victim on UN standards, and said the assessmentaposs findings were highly consistent with Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfeaposs allegations of torture and ill-treatment. Richard Ratclfe said it would take a long time for his weaposs mental anxiety to go away and the situation was still very uncertain, ahead of herto court in Iran on Sunday. Speaking about her treatment on Times Radio, he said: In fairness to the Iranian regime they are quite sophisticated about not leaving physical scars but they do an awful lot of cruel tricks. Things are still very uncertain... that fear of bad stuff happening again, of being put back in solitarywill stay with her until sheaposs safe. It takes a long time for that anxiety to go away. Mr Ratclfe, said his six-year-old daughter Gabriella was definitely weaponised against his we but that was a standard tactic. He said that guards would call their own children outside his weaposs cell, when she could not, which he described as a real studied cruelty. As Mrs Zaghari-Ratlfe prepares toto court in Iran on Sunday, Redress has called on the Government to recognise her as a victim of torture, having sent the Foreign Secretary the -page report on the mother-of-one it commissioned from the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims . Coming a day after Boris Johnson demanded her release in a call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the report says Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe has post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder because of extremely stressful, traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran and the uncertainty surrounding her immediate future. It also says at the beginning of her sentence in , Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe was interrogated for hours on end, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement. Redress says the report also shows the former Thomson Reuters Foundation aid administrator has suffered hair loss, developed obsessive compulsive disorder about washing, and was repeatedly forced to endure hearing a female prison guardaposs conversations with her daughter, exacerbating her distress at being separated from her own child. In addition, she experiences ongoing physical pain and impairment in her neck, right shoulder, and arm, which arose as a result of her treatment and the denial of medical care, Redress said in a statement.  Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe, , last week completed a five-year sentence in Tehran on spying charges levied by Iranian authorities, the last year of which was spent under house arrest due to the pandemic. The charity released a summary letter from from the IRCT detailing findings from the independent physical and psychological evaluation of Nazanin ... conducted by two doctors who are recognised forensic specialists over three days in October . That letter states Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe is in urgent need of psychiatric pharmacological and psychotherapeutic support, as well as evaluation and treatment of her physical symptoms. Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfeaposs pain and suffering have not abated due to her release from imprisonment to house arrest, the letter says.  While she is not feeling as acute stress as she did when she was in prison, she continues to relive and suffer from the serious and long-lasting traumatising issues she experienced during the past years. In the long-term, without reunication with her family in the UK and effective treatment, Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfeaposs conditions will become chronic and potentially deteriorate. Her psychological symptoms and disorders will be unable to resolve themselves and will become chronic and potentially worsen. Redress director Rupert Skilbeck said: Redress has long held that Nazaninaposs treatment by Iran amounts to torture. Based on this new evidence, the UK government should publicly acknowledge that Nazanin is a victim of torture in Iran, and do everything in its power to protect her from further harm. In their letter to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab accompanying the report, Redress said: Iranaposs treatment of Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe is based on discrimination against her for being a British citizen.Iranian authorities have intentionally inflicted severe suffering on Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe for the purpose of intimidating or coercing the UK Government into negotiating a deal for her release, coercing her into giving a confession, and forcing her to provide information about others.

He was born into the risk of kidnapping or worse but his service as a front line Army officer and Apache pilot in Afghanistan means he is a top terror target. Almost ten years ago a senior Taliban fighter claimed in an interview with the Daily Mirror his men had plotted to target Harry “many times” during his tours in Afghanistan. Qari Nasrullah, an Afghan Taliban leader, told us: “There were many plans to capture him – maybe it was his good luck he managed to escape.” Today former SAS soldier Bob Craft told the Daily Mirror: “As a royal Prince Harry is clearly a target for kidnapping, terrorism and a whole range of threats. “But his military service adds to that enormously. “He will need some form of security for a long time, particularly as it is known he served in Afghanistan and was known to be a target whilst out there.” It is also feared that whilst living in America Prince Harry may face a large number of ied threats, not just from known terror groups. Ex Parachute Regiment soldier and security expert Paul Biddiss, military adviser to film directors, told the Daily Mirror: “Ex special forces soldiers have to be discreet about their identities after they leave because they are obviously under threat. “But Harry did not choose to be a threat, he was born into it as a royal. His service, particularly in Afghanistan presents obvious threats from terrorism. “But in America, as we have seen recently, there are also conspiracy theorists, fringe groups, far right-wing networks, all kinds of armed groups who could be a threat. “Harry will need to be protected as he is one of the,not the most under threat royals there are.He needs security protection, clearly.” Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family.

A senior former military intelligence officer who also served in the British Army said: “There are a whole range of range of threats facing him in America from armed groups and other networks. “Buthe has chosen his new le in America it is likely he should foot the bill for his security, which he will definitely need. “My recollection is that it would not be the Queen who would allocate how much the UK pays for this, or even makes a contribution but it is the Home Office.

Labour MP Steve Reed was speaking on BBCaposs Question Time on Thursday during a discussion on what men can do to make women feel safe on our streets. It follows the disappearance of Sarah Everard, a -year-old woman who was last seen a week ago in Clapham. Droves of women have gone on to share their shocking experiences and fears about walking alone, and have taken to social media to list the ways they try to protect themselves when out in public. During the discussion on the BBCaposs flagship question and answer programme the Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government called on men to do their part in helping women feel safer. He said: I have been really struck today from women I have talked to and women I have seen commenting on social media just how widespread this sense of fear is and how many women have experienced abuse or harassment on the streets. The extent of it I was surprised by it, I think every woman has the right to feel safe walking around the streets of this country, anytime whatsoever, what happened today and the fear that women feel is not the fault of women, itaposs the fault of men, who have allowed women to feel this way. I think itaposs incumbent on men actually to reflect on how we act towards women, we all have to call out attitudes that are abusive towards women whenever we see it. We have to become allies of women much more. Iaposm aware when Iaposm walking around the streets at nightIaposm walking faster than a woman whoaposs ahead of me I should cross the road.

Along with many practical considerations, the emotional toll it takes can be overwhelming, creating a sense of grief that can be painful to confront. “Your parents are the people who knew you first, they know your history, they know all the stories about you,” says Claire Hewson. “They love you unconditionally. “When they’re gone, when that’s gone, and they’re not around, it’s a struggle.” Coping can depend on many things. The support you have from those around you, and the plans already laid in place. “I was lucky. My mother was a fantastic organiser,” says Claire, , a call centre manager from London. “She organised her funeral with the local Co-op Funeralcare – her coffin, the car she wanted, and even the flowers she wanted. “All I had to do was the music. Everything  was arranged and paid for. I will always be grateful to my mum for doing that. I wouldn’t have known what to choose.” Coping with loss The last couple of years have been ‘challenging and horrible’ for Claire, who lost her father, Bob, to cancer in May , and her mum, Eileen, who died suddenly in June , whilst in hospital being treated for an ongoing liver issue. “It just felt like the rug had been pulled from underneath me. No-one tells you about death or what it feels like to lose someone. There’s still a stigma when it comes to talking about it.” And yet, while she lost them both within a short period, her experience with each was quite dferent. “Dad was in a hospice so we were going in every day, and the nurses were amazing, telling us what to look out for,” says Claire. “Every day we went in, not knowing ‘will it be today’ ” Claire was still coming to terms with losing her father when her mum died.  “It was dferent dealing with each death. With dad, it’s like I knew he was gone, I saw his body. Mum’s death was sudden, so I never got to say goodbye, and that really does mess with your brain, there’s no finality. Planning ahead The fact that her mum had sorted out her funeral was a blessing. “When my mum’s sister died it was traumatic for everyone trying to arrange the funeral and sort the money out. Mum saw this unfolding and didn’t want that for me. “She said she didn’t want me to have to worry about anything with her funeral. She went to Co-op Funeralcare and had a chat and chose what she wanted. She said they were very pleasant, and it was easy to do. “I will always be grateful to mum for that because I wasn’t in my right mind and I’d urge anybody to do that. It makes that part so much easier for those left behind. All I had to do was phone them up and give them her details and that was it. It took the pressure off, and people don’t always have the money.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sarah everard familys tribute shining","story":"NewsSarah Everard familys tribute to shining example as daughter taken from usSarah was last seen in Clapham, south London before disappearing, and politan Police officer Wayne Couzens has been arrested on suspicion of her kidnapping and murdermirrorShareByJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video sarah-everard-map-key-locations-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Human remains were found in woodlands near Ashford, Kent last night after the marketing executive, , disappeared eight days ago. While formal identication awaits, Sarahaposs family said tonight: Our beautul daughter Sarah was taken from us and we are appealing for any information that will help to solve this terrible crime. Sarah was bright and beautul - a wonderful daughter and sister. She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour.  She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives. We would like to thank our friends and family for all their support during this awful time and we would especially like to thank Sarah’s friends who are working tirelessly to help. We are so grateful to the police and would like to thank them for all they are doing. We are now pleading for additional help from the public. Please come forward and speak to the policeyou have any information. No piece of information is too insignicant. Thank you.  A police officer arrested on suspicion of the kidnap and murder of Sarah has been further detained in custody, the Met said this evening. PC Wayne Couzens, , of the force, is being quizzed over her disappearance. He remains in custody at a London police station after an application to extend his detention was granted at Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court, the Met said. A woman aged in her s, who was arrested at the same time on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been released on bail toto a police station on a date in mid-April. Sarah’s family have been informed of these developments, the Met added. The family statement comes this evening after it emerged Couzens was rushed to hospital with a head injury. Scotland Yard said the suspect was injured in custody and taken for treatment before being ed. A statement said: The suspect was taken to a hospital for treatment to a head injury sustained while in custody.  He has since been discharged and ed to custody. We are not prepared to discuss further. Couzens was arrested on Tuesday night on suspicion of kidnap, before being rearrested yesterday on suspicion of murder. He is also being detained over a separate allegation of indecent exposure. It is claimed that CCTV footage from a passing bus led to his arrest, with another report claiming a car linked to the suspect was allegedly spotted on a motoristaposs dashcam. The serving cop - a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command - is thought to have been off-duty when Sarah disappeared. Cressida Dick, the Metaposs Commissioner, announced the discovery of the human remains last night. She said identying could take time and added that the force was utterly appalled that one of their own had been arrested.

The group claims the force has u-turned on its position, which had allowed the event to go ahead, in light of Covid laws. A spokesperson for the Reclaim These Streets group said it will seek an order in the High Court on Friday challenging the politan Policeaposs interpretation of coronavirus restrictions against human rights law. The vigil, due to take place at Clapham Common bandstand in south London on Saturday, was organised after Ms Everardaposs suspected kidnap and murder sparked anger over the safety of women on the UKaposs streets. In a statement tweeted on Thursday evening, Reclaim These Streets said it was organised by a group of women who wanted to channel the collective grief, outrage and sadness in our community.  Our plan was to hold a short gathering, centred around a minute of silence to remember all women lost to violence, the statement added. Under the current Covid lockdown in England, people are mostly required to stay at home and can only gather in larger groups for limited reasons, such as funerals or for education. Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of £, for someone holding a gathering of more than  people. Reclaim These Streets said it was always aware of the challenges of organising a Covid-secure vigil, but safety has been a top priority from the beginning. It claimed: When we initially proposed the event, we proactively reached out to Lambeth Council and politan Police to ensure that the event could safely and legally take place.After initially receiving a positive response, we continued to plan and promote the event and continued to update the Council and Police. The politan Police said that they were apostrying to navigate a way throughapos and that they were aposcurrently developing a local policing planapos to allow the vigil to take place and to enable them to aposdevelop an appropriate and proportionate local responseapos to the event. Since this statement, the politan Police have reversed their position and stated that the vigil would be unlawful and that, as organisers, we could face tens of thousands of pounds in fines and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crimes Act. The group said it had taken advice from human rights lawyers who it claimed viewed that the politan Police are wrong in their interpretation of the law and that socially distant, outdoor gathering of this kind are allowed under the current lockdown regulations, when read together with the Human Rights Act. Lawyers have written to the force challenging their interpretation of coronavirus legislation, the Reclaim These Streets statement added.

Every conversation on my WhatsApp is about Sarah. All of my social media feeds are about her. The -year-old was walking home when she vanished from the street. She was walking along a well-lit road, wearing bright clothes and called her boyfriend.She did all the things we as women are taught to do from childhood to keep us safe from men. We do not know what happened to her. Police say human remains, believed to be Sarah, have been found. The tragedy has deeply effected women everywhere and heightened the fears many of us face every time we go outside after dark. I like running in the evening, but I havenapost been able to do that since September as itaposs dark by the time I log off work. So I set my alarm an hour earlier every morning so I can go out before I start. Itaposs not a big deal and I donapost think much of it. But when I do think about it, it is a big deal. I have to change my routine every day just because Iaposm a woman. Winter and lockdown means I canapost see anyone in the week at the moment as I donapost feel comfortable walking to and from my socially-distanced walks in the dark. Itaposs , how are we at a point where women still donapost feel safe walking alone. And itaposs not just at night. When Sarah vanished, there was a disgusting yet predictable outpouring of aposwhy was she walking alone at nightapos comments on social media. Swathes of society have a default position of blaming women for being the victims of violence and harassment. To highlight the issue, women have been sharing what they do on a daily basis to keep themselves safe. From carrying their keys as a potential weapon in case they need to fight back to always planning walking routes in advance, these are all things we donapost even give a second thought anymore - we just have to do it. Interestingly, many men have admitted they didnapost realise the extent to which women are afraid. Interestingly, in the wake of Sarah’s disappearance men have admitted they were ignorant to the extent to which women are afraid. I am not alone in changing my day to day to avoid certain situations. Far from it. Speaking to the Mirror, a group of woman have shared the things they do every day - and how it has an impact on their lives - to highlight the true situation we still face every single day. By Rhian Lubin and Zoe Forsey Sam,   When I run I plan my route to make sure at any point I can detourneeds be, I have and still will walk with my keys between my fingers. I want to say I feel safe but I donapost. Caroline,  My husband now takes the dog round the block for his bedtime toilet trip every day since I was spooked by a group of men following and shouting at me to stop and they just wanted to play with my dog and say hi. This was not a badly lit or out of the way road. I still do the mornings in but I regularly feel I need to make a snap call whether to keep walking past my house to the main road or risk approaching my door and being trapped as I fumble for keysthere is just me and one man on the street. I cannot look forward to or enjoy these solo walks with my dog, always planning the safest roads to get to the park, hoping the park is busy enough I’m not always looking over my shoulder.  Pre-lockdown at night I used to tell my husband when to expect me and walk the five minutes from the tube station with my keys between my knuckles. I was harassed and followed by a man from a bus stop and called a c*** for not wanting to speak to him and not one person stepped in, just looked at the floor. I walked into the high street instead of home and stayed in a corner shop for  minutes waiting until I felt safe to walk home. Except it’s never really safe for us. This is just two examples of many. Karolina Ba, , entrepreneur, Edinburgh I grew up in Poland where I was always the only black person in every room. I was harassed and cat-called since I was a young girl. But a few years ago I was studying and working part time as a receptionist at a hostel in Edinburgh.  Once after finishing at midnight, I was walking home and a car passed me then turned around and parked in front of me. A man got out and opened the boot then started saying strange things to me, still standing by the boot. I had my keys in hand, my heart was beating so fast, I thought that was it. I told him that my boyfriend was waiting for me and he seemed to get spooked.I passed him quickly, still looking behind me, he got in the car and left and I just ran home.It was the single most frightening experience of my le.I never took an evening sht at the hostel after that. Clementine,   I hate talking on the phone, it makes me anxious and I can never focus on the conversation. Yet I will always call someoneI’m walking alone, no matter how short or long the journey, it’s something I know I have to do. Just in case. Kate,  Whatever time of day Iaposm out walking Iaposll always do a glance round every five or  minutes just to make sure that Iaposm not being followed, and I always avoid eye contact with other people walking past. If Iaposm meeting a friend I always make sure it is a public place andtheyaposre a bit late arriving then I make sure that I stand somewhere where there are lots of people round and try to look busy on my phone. And in the days when we could go outI am walking back late then I most often always wear flats. Samantha,  One night at university, a drunken male student broke into my room. I was asleep and he got in my bed and I woke up as he was on top of me and had his hands around my throat. He was a lot bigger and stronger than me. I thought I might die. He seemed to think it was funny. Luckily, some other male students heard me trying to call for help and came in and got him out. At the time, I didnapost want to make a fuss, I was , had just moved away from home for the first time, he was drunk so it was kind of brushed off as funny... but it really traumatised me. It was far from the first time Iaposd been harassed by a man , but I think whataposs interesting about this experience is it was a aposdecentapos man. It was a man from a nice family, who on every other occasion had been nothing but aposnice.apos Now he is married and thinks of himself as the kind of man who wouldnapost hurt a woman, Iaposm sure. He has been able to disassociate himself from that experience - and that is the crux of the problem. EVERY woman has a story like this. But hardly ANY men seem to know a man whose done it. We picture the kind of men who attack women as monsters - theyaposre aposotherapos, theyaposre not aposus.apos Actually, they are us. That is the problem. And i also feel guilty for allowing it to be brushed off. Because I donapost knowthat was the last time he behaved in that way to a woman. Because it is always on the victim to change things - itaposs always the womanaposs fault never on the perpetrators. I could not have been doing anything *less* than aposasking for it. I was in a locked room, alone, asleep. I wasnapost even safe there. Nikki Kopelman, , translator, Cardf As a student, I was accosted by men on a particular street in Cardf on my way home from nights out. It only ever happenedI was on my own.The men kept “complimenting” me as I walked past, then matched pace with me evenI walked faster. I turned a corner to seethey kept following and they did, so I ran for several blocks before eventually doubling back to my house.This happened more than once.Jane Kennedy, , magazine publisher, Wiltshire From Suzy Lamplugh to Sarah Everard, the fear has not gone away and the threat is constant.

In his first primetime televised address to the country, the US President also said he would ramp up the mass inoculation programme.He vowed on Thursday he would direct states to make all adults eligible for the coronavirus vaccine by May .But the Democrat also urged Americans to stay vigilant against the virus, hours after he signed a . trillion cash injection bill into law. In a speech from the White House on the first anniversary of the pandemic lockdown, Biden said July  Independence Day was the target for ato some normality and an independence from Covid. He said he needed aposevery American to do their partapos and added: If we do all this,we do our part,we do this together, by July  thereaposs a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to get together. In your back yard or in your neighbourhood and have a cookout and a BBQ and celebrate Independence Day. In the US the virus has killed more than , people, the most of any country. Coronavirus-related lockdowns and restrictions have also cost huge swathes of jobs. In a recounting of the grim toll the pandemic has taken on the nation, Biden said: Photos and videos from  feel like they were taken in another era. The last vacation. The last birthday with friends. The last holiday with extended family. While it was dferent for everyone, we all lost something, he said, noting that the virus was met with denials for days, then weeks, then months, that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, more loneliness. He announced he was ordering U.S. states, territories and tribes to make all adults eligible to receive a coronavirus vaccine by May . The White House has said it would have enough vaccine supply to vaccinate the population by the end of May. About  per cent of Americans have so far been fully vaccinated and the president said more U.S. troops would help in the inoculation effort. He said that families and friends should be able to gather again in small groups by July , a holiday that many Americans celebrate with outdoor parties, hot dogs and fireworks.

Moe Al Kaissey, , desperately clutched a windscreen wiper for more than km as the driver ran red lights and swerved into oncoming traffic through a Canadian city last Wednesday. The smartly dressed thief arrived at the dealership in London, Ontario with an accomplice posing as an interested customer looking at a black  BMW M worth £,. Moe kept the keys but turned the engine on to show how the vehicle ran before stepping out when the man asked to make a phone call. The salesman was standing in front of the car when the bandit floored the accelerator and ploughed right into him. He held on despite the driver attempting to ram him into a street pole in a bid to lose him, and finally tumbled off on a busy highway. Moe staggered to the curb, narrowly escaping the path of the accompliceaposs silver Audi as the pair made off. He told local CHCH News: My instinct was just to hang on.I was screaming for them to stop. Screaming for other cars to call , for somebody to just do something. Shocking footage captures the masked thief striking up conversation with Moe moments before making his getaway.Moeaposs brother Mustafa said: He was swerving right and left aggressively to try to throw Moe off the vehicle. When the BMW slowed in traffic, Moe decided it was chance to let go and thankfully escaped with only a minor knee injury and bruises.The dealership said in a post on Facebook : We are thankful for our sales rep to be alive. The more people that see this, the higher the chances of identying these criminals and stopping them from doing more harm to anyone in the future. Police are hunting the two thieves who targeted the Sport Motors dealership and encouraging anyone with information to come forward. The caraposs GPS revealed it was driven two hours to North York, near Toronto, but from there the tracker went dead.

The anonymous man explained that he met his current girlfriend around six months ago, and they hit it off immediately. He thought he hit the jackpot because not only is she “loving, caring, optimistic, beautul - basically the entire package”, but she also has long red hair - or so he thought. The -year-old revealed that all of his ex-partners had red hair and that he’s just not attracted to people with any other hair colour. So, when she mentioned that she needed to get her roots coloured, he was baffled. He said: She showed me the roots of her hair, which were hidden right at the very top, and told me she wasn’t a natural redhead and thought I would have realised by now. The colour of her roots is a dusty brown colour that I don’t find attractive at all. Taken aback by the news, he flipped out. The man added: I asked her why she had lied to me, and she said she had never claimed to be naturally redheaded. “She knew about my attraction to redheads, but said she figured it wasn’t that big of a deal.” But after confiding in his friend, the boyfriend was told he was being “shallow”.

It’s a technique that was also employed by Nasa’s previous rover, Curiosity. But Perseverance has a microphone that allows us to actually hear the laser at work. The sound of the laser hitting rocks reveals knowledge such as the hardness of the targets being investigated. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section “If we tap on a surface that is hard, we will not hear the same sound as when we fire on a surface that is soft,” explained Naomi Murdoch, from the National Higher French Institute of Aeronautics and Space, in Toulouse. “Take for example chalk and marble. These two materials have an identical chemical composition , but very dferent physical properties.” In a media briefing Dr Murdoch played three dferent sounds recorded by the SuperCam microphone. One was of the general sound of Mars, the second was of some wind gusts, and the third was the staccato pops from the laser in action.

share details of how they get active, how often and where, in a survey to help shape the future of sports and leisure provision across the region.Leading provider of sports and leisure services, charitable trust Fe Sports and Leisure Trust, is working with Fe Council, NHS Fe and Fe Golf Trust to build a picture of how accessible information is regarding opportunities to get active in Fe.The survey aims to improve the ways which service providers can better signpost the range of facilities, activities and programmes for all ages, abilities and interests.The survey is available on the Fe Sports and Leisure Trust website and closes on March , .Scott Urquhart, sport and physical activity team manager for Fe Sports and Leisure Trust, said: “The survey only takes a few minutes to complete and I’d encourage people to take part, no matter how little or often or where they currently take part in physical activity – their input can really help improve the way programmes and activities are promoted and made accessible to local communities.”The survey comes at a time when all  of Fe Sports and Leisure Trust’s facilities are closed due to Covid- restrictions.The closures will be in place until Scottish Government advice states it is appropriate for sports and leisure facilities to resume, and the trust says it will contact programme participants, health and wellbeing programme users, clubs and Leisure Active members directly with further information.Convener of the community and housing service sub-committee Councillor Judy Hamilton commented: #We all know that movement and physical activity is essential to our health and wellbeing and we want services that provide those opportunities for us.#This is an excellent opportunity to give your thoughts and suggest ways that we could mould our services to fit you.#For further details, visit the trust’s website at www.feleisure.org.uk . vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

occasions to be celebrated with cards, gts, hugs and even kisses.One milestone, though, whose passing brings only melancholy and frustration is the marking of a year since fans were at a football game in this part of Scotland.The turnstiles have not clicked, the pies have stayed unmunched and the referees have had slightly less abuse than normal.Boy, have we missed it all.Around . pm on Tuesday, March , , I sauntered up to the main entrance at Dens Park from my usual parking space near Radio Tay.By coincidence, I had also worked at what would turn out to be Dundee United#s final fixture of the campaign # the - draw with Partick Thistle at Tannadice on the previous Saturday.By then, there was awareness that a new virus – recently named Covid- # had made its way from China to other parts of the world, including Scotland.The first case here had been confirmed on March , when a patient was diagnosed after ing home to Tayside from Italy.However, we were all still working at our desks in the office, rather than occupying the couches and armchairs that have become home to so many backsides since.Masks were still things that were worn by bankrobbers, Joe Wicks was a place where you bought kitchens and the Grassy Beach path down at the Stannergate had yet to be walked by half the population of the city.Indeed, le was normal enough for , spectators to gather – not distanced, socially or otherwise # to watch Dundee play Ayr United on a freezing cold night.My match report made no mention of the health tsunami that was about to engulf Scottish football.Of more interest to me as a local hack was a good - victory for the Dark Blues.It read: “Goals from Kane Hemmings and Olly Crankshaw sent Dundee leaping over opponents Ayr into third place in the Championship.“Hemmings raced clear of the visitors’ defence as the game at Dens Park ticked into its th minute, shooting low into the net.“Substitute Crankshaw made sure with a goal two minutes into injury-time after he was found by Graham Dorrans’ cutback.“James McPake’s men have now gone six games undefeated – three wins and three draws – and are now tucked in behind Inverness Caley Thistle, who are four points ahead in second spot in the table.”None of us really thought it would be the last time fans would be in the stadium.Lockdown followed, as did a crazy summer in Scottish football, with Dundee at the heart of it all with their infamous yes no vote.Supporters’ absence has undoubtedly highlighted the privileged position of a football writer.No journalist covering the national game will have taken for granted their seat # complete with name tag and or tick sticker – while thousands around them remain empty.Being brutally honest, there have been some positives to the lack of crowds.There is the parking – no need to arrive at Celtic Park or Ibrox hours before kick-off – but even that brings with it a pang of guilt as you drive through empty streets that should be full of hustle and bustle.Also, we lucky few have been treated to the wonders of the touchline banter. This has given us all an insight into how managers conduct their players during matches, although some of the industrial language has left you wishing your mask could cover your ears as well as your nose and mouth.Interviews have changed, not for the better. Pre-match stuff is one over Zoom, while post-match has seen some players who normally talk in hushed tones become completely inaudible behind their face coverings.The wall table police tape between media and football folk doesn’t help but we all know why the barrier is there and accept it.There has been worth to the action that has taken place on the pitch this season and every official at every club deserves immense credit for making it possible.It just hasn’t been the same without the atmosphere created by people.The great Jock Stein said: “Without fans who pay at the turnstile, football is nothing.”The legendary manager was, of course, right to highlight how the game needs those who love it most.It is a diminished spectacle without them.The remarkable thing is, when the history books cover Scottish football during the Covid era, fans will still take pride of place.Tales will be told of season tickets bought with no hope of attending matches, modest bank accounts and piggy-banks raided to keep their club alive, and all manner of community and charitable good deeds done.This is not a happy anniversary we mark this week but,you can, try to imagine that first sight of the green grass when the doors finally reopen.It will seem like Christmas, holiday time and your birthday all rolled into one. vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

Fertility Centre could help to improve a women’s chances of having a baby through IVF.Part of Aberdeen University#s Obstetrics and Gynaecology department, the centre has invested in a new embryoscope which allows the team to take photos of developing embryos and utilise time-lapse technology to monitor them in more detail.Laboratory manager, Dr Elizabeth Ferguson, said: “When using conventional incubators, the embryos must be removed and monitored under a microscope to determine which are most likely to offer the best chance of pregnancy.#But this method only gives us information from a single point in time so crucial developmental changes are sometimes missed.“This new equipment automatically takes images every  minutes for the duration of the embryo culture period, which is usually  or  days, and the images are compiled into time-lapse videos.#These videos enable our embryologists to monitor development in more detail and without disturbing the embryo, which helps us to identy the best quality embryos with the most potential.”Funded by the Scottish Government, which also provides the NHS funding for the IVF service, the £, embryoscope uses articial intelligence to help embryologists assess each embryo in a more consistent way.Embryo assessments are generated automatically, and a scoring system is used to determine the likelihood of each embryo being successfully

being part of the Peterhead squad, but believes he has made the right decision to retire from playing.The -year-old defender has called time on his career, finishing up at the Blue Toon, who he made seven appearances for this term.Leagues One and Two are due to resume next week, but MacKenzie feels the time is right to hang up his boots.Explaining the reasons for his decision, he said “The stop-start nature of the things and the unknown over the last couple of months has been tough.“It was the same last year with the first lockdown, but in some ways it was a bit of a novelty.“But then once you’ve been back playing and you get shut down again with no word really for a couple of months it’s dficult.“I had been considering retiring last year before I signed for Peterhead, but with the last lockdown going on as long as it did I was desperate to get back playing.“But this time has been tougher both mentally and physically and I kind of knew it was my time to call it a day.“Mentallyyou’re not quite there you feel all your wee aches a wee bit more, the runs are a bit harderyou’re not quite there mentally.“I spoke to Jimand he asked me to take a bit of time to think about it, but I wasn’t wanting to string anyone along and pick up a wage for something I wasn’t going to be fully committed to.“The timing of this isn’t ideal for Peterhead and the boys, butI’d carried on I feel I’d have been cheating them because it wouldn’t have been the whole me.“Jim and the guys understood and I think a lot of people have found this lockdown a lot harder.”MacKenzie counts being called up for two Scotland squads, playing for boyhood heroes Rangers, winning a Challenge Cup with Dundee, playing in the English Championship with Blackpool and winning the Scottish Championship with St Mirren among his career highlights.He enjoyed his stint with Peterhead after signing last summer and admits he’s found it dficult to leave the Buchan outfit.MacKenzie added: “I really enjoyed my time at Peterhead, it was tough at the start with the delayed season and getting upto speed.“In a way it’s almost like going back to when I was a boy playing with my pals in terms of the camaraderie and atmosphere and it was a bit more relaxed than at the top level.“The hardest bit for me rather than hanging up the boots, was walking away from the boys because I’d developed good relationships with them.“Jason Brown, who I played with at the back, was gutted because he felt he was coming on as a player from me being there and playing beside him.“But I’ll always be at the end of the phoneany of the boys need me and when things are back to normal I’d be willing to go training and help them outthey wanted me.“That was probably tougher for me because physically you know what comes with football and saying to the boys that I was finished was tough because I’ve got to know them and I’ve seen them get better and there’s some really impressive players there.”For as little as

We’ve brought incomers too: piglets from Cowal, calves from Loch Awe and a flock of wild blackies from Dana. Together we’ve set up home and embarked on a mission to live off the land.It’s funny to call something so basic a ‘mission’ asTom Cruise were about to somersault through a window with a self-destructing message exploding in his fist. For millennia it was how everyone lived, yet now the idea of denying oneself a breakfast of Peruvian avocado washed down with a Calornian almond-milk-latte seems intrepid,not heroic.The most heroic thing that happens here on our croft is the odd rugby tackle of a daft ewe trailing half a bramble bush behind her, or brushing one shaggy highland calf when her two pals are desperate for their turn. Our three girls are almost a year old now and on the ridge below our house with the Sound of Jura behind them they look unarguably majestic, but take a closer look and there’s a bucket of mischief in those ginger-fringed eyes.Take too long preening one young lady and there’ll be four stubby horns threatening the backside of either the groomer or the groomed. The pushiest of these -kilo beasties will then ensconce herself in the salon seat, head thrown back, eyes closed while her gorgeous tresses are prettied.It certainly would be mission impossibleanyone were even to suggest these pampered princesses were plate-bound. Their job is to look pretty and maybe have a wee winch with a handsome local bull when they come of age, but we’re not all veggies here on the croft, so something had to be done.The meat section is a pretty strip of woodland inhabited by three of the daftest, squeakiest saddleback pigs this side of Glen Croe. They’re known as Small, Medium and Splodge in the vain hope of maintaining a strictly professional relationship. Their main carer has, however, been encouraging them to use her as a playground to be climbed on, bounced on and nibbled. She, our eldest daughter, assures me she will still happily feast on sausages when the time comes.We’re already enjoying the two lambs and the ewe who made the ultimate sacrice a couple of weeks ago, so the precedent has been set, but it’s not easy. Easy would be flinging New Zealand chops and Danish bacon into the shopping trolley, but that’s not part of the ‘mission’. We’ll cut back on the almond-lattes and avocado toasts, but will the croft yield Argyll’s finest cocoa and coffee beans – and a mountain of chardonnay grapes  This is my mission and I choose to accept it…"},{"url":null,"title":"building the glashan hydro scheme","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Many TSB customers will have a very long journey to reach their nearest branch. Not everybody can use internet banking.The FCA has already pointed out that during the Covid pandemic it will be hard for banks to reach their customers and engage effectively with them on closure proposals.They also pointed out that customers may not be able to get to a bank to make the necessary preparations before the closure, such as transferring to another bank.Instead of just pointing out these dficulties, the FCA should step in and tell TSB not to go ahead with these closures.Leaving only one TSB branch open in Argyll and Bute is unacceptable.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,After an exceptionally challenging year for older people, Age Scotland is seeking their views in the first comprehensive survey of what it is like to grow older in Scotland.The Big Survey explores all areas of le for older people including health and wellbeing, housing, media representation and the impact of Covid-.We hope to gain a better insight into what older people think, experience and care about. Survey responses will help to prioritise future campaigns and shape policy.Older people were asked to shield, the overwhelming majority of deaths took place among the over s and care home residents faced months of separation from family and friends.Lockdown has contributed to soaring levels of loneliness and the absence of regular exercise activities and sports has had an impact on physical fitness.We are pleased to be launching The Big Survey at such an opportune time. This has been a tumultuous time for older people and undoubtedly the past  months have had a profound impact across society.We want to hear how older people#s lives have been affected by Covid, what their expectations are now, how they want to live and what their requirements are for enjoying a fulfilling and happy later le.I would urge as many older people as possible to take part. Each and every response will be considered and they will help shape our policies and our work in the coming years.So please take the time to share your views and help us be there to support older people throughout Scotland in ways that make a real dference.Visit www.ageuk.org.uk scotland to find out more about The Big Survey.We look forward to hearing from you.Brian Sloan, chief executive, Age ScotlandSir,Barnardo’s Scotland foster carers look after children across the west of Scotland, giving them the best chance to have a happier and positive future.But the charity is concerned that the pandemic could lead to a sharp increase in requests to the charity for foster care and is asking for more potential carers in Argyll and Bute to come forward.The pandemic and lockdowns have increased pressure on vulnerable families, with job losses, deepening poverty and worsening mental health which could all lead to family breakdown.Fostering is an exceptional job.We are looking for people who can do a lot of juggling between work, care and home schooling under lockdown.

Indeed, it’s clear that this is the most worrying time in recent history to get a cancer diagnosis.At Macmillan, people are calling our support line every day to tell us about the heightened anxiety, loneliness and distress that they are feeling.On our support line – open seven days a week on     – specially trained nurses, counsellors and financial support advisors are available to help anyone affected by, or worried about, cancer. They can provide comprehensive information and advice, as well as emotional support, to help people with cancer cope with the additional strain of the coronavirus pandemic.We know doctors and nurses are working in unspeakably dficult conditions and are having to make tough decisions every day. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to keep cancer care on track, but we also know that some treatment – operations, for example – are being cancelled or postponed because essential services such as ITU are full of seriously ill people with Covid-.What is absolutely vital is thatthere are changes to treatment plans, these must involve the person living with cancer and be communicated clearly.Although some changes may be needed for treatment plans, this is not the case everywhere or for all treatments or tests. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to make hospitals a safe environment so it’s really important that people with cancer who have been invited for tests or treatment do attend.GPs are openyou are worried about possible cancer symptoms, and screening and other vital tests have resumed in a Covid-safe way. The NHS is still here for you.As well as our support line, comprehensive cancer information and support is also available on www.macmillan.org.uk and our online community is there to provide invaluable emotional and peer support.Gordon McLean, strategic partnership manager in Scotland for Macmillan Cancer SupportSir,Inclusion Scotland, the leading Scottish disabled people’s organisation, believes that planning for the post Covid- Scotland must be about building towards a more inclusive future for disabled people, not back to an old #normal# that excluded a lot of us.As we launch our manesto for the  Scottish Parliament elections, disabled people have told us about the problems they face daily, both before and as a result of Covid-, and what needs to change.Before Covid-, disabled people were already some of the most marginalised and excluded in society.We were more likely to live in poverty, be unemployed or earn less than non-disabled people, and less likely to leave school with qualications, because of the barriers and exclusion we face in our day-to-day lives.The Covid- crisis and responses to it highlighted this, aggravating existing inequalities and generating new ones, and putting the human rights of disabled people at further risk.Going back to the way things were before is not the answer. We don’t want to go back. We want to go forward to a more inclusive future.The manesto # Rights and Renewal # sets out what disabled people told Inclusion Scotland are the most important issues they face and what needs to be done to make a post-pandemic Scotland a better place for disabled people. It has five key asks:I call on all political parties fighting the Scottish Parliament elections and their candidates to pledge their support for disabled people’s Five Asks.Dr Sally Witcher, Inclusion Scotland chief executive officerSir,Our dilapidated roads continue to be raised as an issue by many constituents.While I understand that our roads department is struggling due to local authority budgets being cut, much more still needs to be done.It has been said to me time and time again that we are fast approaching the point of noand when it comes to our roads and that neglecting day-to-day maintenance will end up costing us more in the long run.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case. All the SNP MSPs on the committee, however, voted against its publication, meaning it will not be released.The Scottish public deserves to know the truth of what happened and why £, of public money had to be paid to Salmond.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,The personal testimony of the men and boys in the final independent report into non-recent sexual abuse in Scottish football # who have shown incredible courage # demonstrates how needed this independent review has been.The abuse young players have suffered in football is inexcusable and heart-breaking. By bravely speaking up, they provided the catalyst for the review and the changes that will come from it are thanks to them.We welcome the ongoing work the Scottish Football Associationhas carried out in light of the report’s recommendations and encourage them to continue their progress.The SFA is showing it is willing to listen and implement changes that ensure no more children suffer the experiences described in the report.We are pleased to see children and young people’s involvement in the process, including the consultation with the Scottish Children’s Parliament. The voices of children and young people are crucial to developing improvements for their own wellbeing and safety and to change a culture where children can be frightened to speak up.Safeguarding in Sport, a partnership between Children st and sportscotland, has developed the Standards for Child Wellbeing and Protection in Sport, which state children have a right to express their views and have their voice taken into account. We are keen to support the SFA in its continued implementation of the recommendations to create a culture in football where we can be sure that every child is safe to enjoy the huge benefits of participating in sport.Any volunteer or official looking for advice or support about a child can contact safeguardinginsport@childrenst.org.uk or contact the Children st Parentline service on   or online at www.childrenst.org.uk parentline.Mary Glasgow, chief executive, Children st.Sir,Zero Waste Scotland’s Energy Efficiency Business Support Service provides free, independent advice to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprisesto introduce more energy efficient technology.Businesses can apply for an interest-free Scottish Government SME loan of £, to £,, with a maximum cashback grant of £, for those eligible.Many businesses in Argyll and Bute have decided to take action to reduce their energy use, adding profit directly to the bottom line while helping Scotland meet its target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by .Since , the impartial advice given to companies in the region has identied almost £m of potential energy savings through heating, lighting and building upgrades.To find out more or to apply, visit www.energy.zerowastescotland.org.uk.

Well done to everyone involved for getting the project to this stage.A broken record we might be, but we make no apology for it.As we have said before, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland have never taken seriously, really seriously, the issue of the Rest and wider Argyll connectivity. If they had, we wouldn#t be talking about it today.Yes, a lot of work has gone into mitigation. But that is all it has ever been # mitigation and nothing like a solution. And a constant drain on public money.We need new, fresh thinking on keeping Argyll connected.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"look out for nuthatches in argyll this spring","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And this number may continue to fall uponto play, as it is anticipated that only half of coaches are expected toto paid positions.In the last year, proactive measures have been put in place in a bid to increase the number of female high-performance coaches, who currently make up  per cent of all performance coaching roles.UK Sport recently launched its leadership programme in a bid to double the representation of female coaches in the Olympic and Paralympic high-performance community by Paris . The programme involves leading coaches mentoring a cohort of  through a six-month course that aims to help them reach the top of their respective sports.And to ensure talented coaches have the opportunity to join the high-performance pathway, UK Coaching has also recently introduced its own female leadership programme, working with national governing bodies to develop female coaches and elevate the positions of women in coaching across all sports at the base of the performance pathway.Yet with UK Coaching’s research showing the importance of female role models and activity levels among this group lower than that of their male counterparts, the organisation believes female coaches will be fundamental as the nation rebuilds after the pandemic.Emma Atkins, director of coaching at UK Coaching said: #We want to see more women come into coaching, be supported to stay in coaching and,it is their goal, progress to coaching in talent and high-performance sport.#Gender equality in sport has made considerable strides in recent years but we must move towards a balanced coaching workforce # and that means showing women that coaching is for them. It is an incredibly rewarding experience. We need more female coaches and we are calling on sports organisations to work with us in our mission to achieve an equitable   split in the next five years.#Our research shows that it’s really important that when starting to get active, women and girls are more comfortabletheir coach is the same gender.

Initial surveys in  led to design work focused on new steel gates for locks one to four.Scottish Canals estimates that the total investment needed to upgrade the infrastructure on the Crinan Canal, including the replacement of all canal gates, is approximately £- million. The entire project is expected to take three years to complete.While the canal has been drained, dredging has also been undertaken at Ardrishaig Harbour and other locations along the canal, boosted by £ million of additional Scottish Government funding to Scottish Canals for dredging in both the Crinan and Caledonian canals.A spokesperson for Scottish Canals gave more detail on the work being

Melrose, Tweedbank, Earlston and Lauder are among the places within the ward.The pitches below originally appeared in the print edition of the Border on February .Jonny Adamson Jonny AdamsonIrsquom fed up with local politics not working.For  years, Irsquove had an interest in the campaign to secure an indoor tennis facility for the Borders.Last year, however, the project stalled and we were given little in the way of communication from the council on the decision.As someone who believes strongly in creating opportunities for young people, and knowing the dference this facility would have made, I felt let down and frustrated.Having engaged with hundreds of people across our community in the last year, Irsquove learned my experience is all too common. People donrsquot feel heard on issues affecting them.Instead of listening to communities, the current administration makes decisions without putting the needs and views of people first.Itrsquos not good enough, and certainly not what is needed as we look to rebuild from the pandemic.So what began as somewhat of a single issue campaign for me, has grown into something much wider.Our local services have been cut to the bone in recent years. Yes, there are funding challenges for all local authorities, but some of the spending decisions taken by this administration have been woeful.As a result, too many of our roads are not fit for purpose, bus services are under threat, playparks are being closed, recycling services reduced, outdoor spaces are not always maintained and public CCTV systems arenrsquot being funded.We can, and must, do better. This isnrsquot time for tribal party politics. We need a constructive approach that prioritises investment in our public services ensuring better roads, protection of green spaces, more opportunities for active travel, greater support for local businesses and groups and resources for our schools.An approach that always works to ensure that peoplersquos needs and views are at the very heart of decisions affecting our community.I know itrsquos possible and,you put your trust in me, yoursquoll get a councillor who will work tirelessly to make it happen.I promise to be an approachable, accessible, committed and energetic representative who will listen to you and make sure your voice is being heard.Mary Douglas Mary DouglasI have lived on a farm in the ward for over  years.My sons, who live and work in the ward, attended Melrose Primary School, as do two of my grandchildren. I worked for the NHS for most of my career before I retired.I am chair of the Scotland Multiple Sclerosiscouncil, and vice chair of the Borders MS Group. In addition, I am a Walk It leader in Earlston.As a member of the community, contributor to and consumer of council services one of my priorities will be to challenge how and why vital decisions on the use of finance and resource, which affect us all, are made.I, and many people I have spoken to, are concerned about planning processes.Permission is granted for large residential and other developments, often in questionable locations, seemingly without consideration of or investment in, the vital infrastructure required to support them.As is now evident, existing services are already stretched to capacity or facing cutbacks, including the NHS, education, social work, water etc. yet more extensive building is planned in the ward.How, for example, was the land at Melrose Gait considered a suitable location for a large residential development next to the refuse centre, on polluted ground, with an inadequate road to serve it.What consideration was given to the additional demands on the wider range of public services needed to support this scheme and its hundreds of residents.The COVID pandemic has most likely changed the way we live long term, people are now working from home, many permanently.Investment is needed in reliable broadband and mobile phone coverage, particularly in rural areas where signals can be unreliable, to support this new way of working.Existing offices, shops and other buildings that may become empty as a result of the pandemic could be repurposed for residential use, with careful planning.As we move forward the COVID Pandemic has made the most effective use of limited resources even more essential in the short and long term.The Borders must emerge from the pandemic in the strongest possible shape to best support the community and businesses into the future.I have no affiliation to any political party. I have always voted for who I believe can make a dference and contribute to local services.I believe that with my experience in public services and a knowledge of the local community I can help provide a focus for the council on the issues and problems that are faced day to day by the people of the Borders.Jenny Linehan Jenny LinehanMy professional le as both a former procurator fiscal and local solicitor taught me two things: speak plainly and never try to second guess the lives of others.Convincing you of my credentials to be your Scottish Conservative councillor for Leaderdale and Melrose is, therefore, a straightforward proposition for me: I will practice honest politics I will do my best to find out what it is that you most care about and fight your corner.Having lived in the ward for  years, I know how strong and ied our local Bordersrsquo economy is.We are lucky in Leaderdale and Melrose to have some of the best high streets in Scotland but they are under threat.I know the value of small business to our economy whether itrsquos standing up for farmers in Blainslie or supporting hotels in Melrose, to helping new businesses set up in Tweedbank.I will work tirelessly to ensure they receive the support they need.As this goes to print, the Scottish Conservatives have successfully pushed the SNP into a U-turn on extending business rates relief.Thatrsquos the kind of action I want to see from our government, not the dither and delay that wersquove seen from the SNP that threatens livelihoods and stles local enterprise.The challenge isnrsquot just to our economy. COVID- has been tough on all of us.With a vaccine on the way there is light at the end of the tunnel. Our NHS staff at the BGH have been fantastic.I would like to thank them for all the work they are doing to keep Borderers safe and healthy.As the mother of three children, education is another priority for me. Our teachers in the Borders have done an excellent job in dficult circumstances but the reality is they are being let down by the SNP government in Edinburgh, who would rather focus on independence than the future wellbeing of the next generation of Scots.I believe that education should be our priority, not further constitutional ision.I will work with our fantastic Scottish Conservative team on the council to make sure Borders schools get their fair share.Michael Needham Michael NeedhamMichael joined the Scottish Green Party several years ago after reflecting on a future with the impact of climate change, war, nuclear and pollution as key national and global concerns.Locally, however, the immediate priority is helping the Leaderdale and Melrose community to a Green recovery following the impacts of COVID- and considering how the new normal should develop.Scottish Borders Green Party welcomes the climate emergency declaration and Michael would push the local council into changing the words of the announcement into actions.Having studied the local development plan, Michael aims to drive environmental change with new builds utilising low carbon heating systems such as heat pumps, regulation has delayed mandatory use of these systems until  but we should show the carbon zero ambitions in the Borders together with improved local authority provision of electric vehicle charging facilities.With a greater gap between income levels and rental   house prices and a lack of affordable housing within the Leaderdale and Melrose areas, itrsquos vital that any new developments at least complies with the minimum provisions agreed for low cost housing.Michael would also aim to protect and improve local bus and train services throughout the Borders and ensure that the operators continue to work towards restoring timetables following the restrictions.The Scottish Green Party was responsible for changes within the Scottish Government that will mean under s will soon get free bus travel throughout Scotland.Other key local issues are: saving the high street with a shop local campaign, unemployment, which has always been more challenging in the Borders, together with people typically earning lower wages.Michael is from Galashiels, has lived most of his le in the Borders and works in the contact centre industry he is currently working from home and is acting co-lead GMB union rep and has been involved in national campaigning to make firing people to re-hire on lesser terms and conditions illegal.Michael is a disability champion within the global organisation he works for and is involved in union policy change and disability discrimination.John Paton Day John Paton DayLeaderdale  Melrose is the jewel in the crown of the Scottish Borders.Then, I may be biased, having lived, worked and raised my family here for the last  years.I have dedicated myself to standing up for numerous grassroots and vital voluntary causes that are close to the hearts of so many in our community.From co-founding the lsquoBorders Small Schools Networkrsquo to chairing Earlston Community Council, I am proud to serve those who call Leaderdale  Melrose home.Itrsquos important that our representatives within Scottish Borders Council understand the needs of local people.It is for this reason that I highlight the following three issues, on which I am seeking your vote next month.The first issue is roads.After yet another cold and wet winter our local roads require urgent repair and improvement ndash and this is not just dealing with potholes: we need to ensure all those using those roads can do so in the safest manner possible.Next is rural housing. As a committee member of Scottish Borders Housing Association, I am ready and able to hold to account those in charge of building affordable housing.I will call for increased investment to speed up the delivery of warmer, safer homes for all.And finally, recycling.Itrsquos vital we are able to do our bit to protect the environment and leave our Borders beautul for the next generation to enjoy however, many of our smaller villages are currently without facilities that make everyday recycling accessible.Itrsquos for this reason I will be seeking greater provision of recycling points that are accessible to all our towns and villages.Last, but by no means least, many of you will be familiar with the hard work and dedication of our much-missed colleague, Councillor Kevin Drum.When Kevin passed away last March after a short illness his loss was felt by so many in our community.Retaining this seat for the SNP will enable me to pick up where Kevin left off continuing his legacy of putting others first and helping to build a better Borders for all.Scott Redpath Scott RedpathThe impact of COVID over the last year has shown us the importance of working together and proved beyond doubt that it is through collective action, rather than constitutional arguments, that we can best face up to the great challenges of our times.I am neither unionist nor nationalist but a socialist and Irsquom standing for Labour in this election because I believe that jobs, wages and public services are key to our recovery from the pandemic.Born and bred in the Borders Irsquove spent most of the last two decades as a shopworker, serving my community, getting to know the problems and challenges people face.Irsquom an experienced campaigner and an active member of the shopworkers union USDAW.I successfully campaigned for changes in the law to protect my colleagues from abuse and tackle the bad practices of employers who, sadly, too often sought to cut corners when it came to their safety and pay.As a councillor I would campaign for a rise in the minimum wage to pound and would push to ensure that the key workers who have stepped up so magnicently during COVID are recognised not just by rainbows and rounds of applause but by better working conditions and proper pay.I would bring an independence of mind to the council chamber, campaigning for action to tackle the attainment gap in our local schools, ensuring people have the quality public services they deserve, pushing for a publicly owned local bus system that better meets our needs properly connecting our towns and villages and ensure that funding provided to SBC to assist people during and after the pandemic gets to those who need it most quickly and without red tape holding them back.On March  vote Labour to help achieve these goals ndash together.Karen Wilks Karen WilksI am a volunteer support officer and session supervisor at Musselburgh Citizenrsquos Advice Bureau.Previously I have worked with Domestic Abuse Advocacy Service in the Scottish Borders, Edinburgh Domestic Abuse Court Service and Victim Support Scotland ndash providing advocacy, information, emotional and practical support to victims of crime within the community and within the Scottish Criminal Justice System.From living in and around Earlston for most of my le and being a parent of a young person in secondary school, I have the same concerns as every other parent has in relation to education, especially given this past year and the dficulties our young people have had to face due to the pandemic.Currently I manage the general advice service within Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau.

Areas such as Glasgow City, North Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian could move to Level , based on cases.Unlike the previous levels system, the Scottish Government is taking a harsher approach to deciding the levels.They are taking point from the World Health Organisation, and are rebasing the indicators that are used to guide decisions on the allocation of levels on the recommendations made by WHO.It is hoped these indicators will be set out fully in the middle of this month.The framework reads: \"Although there are some dferences, this aligns broadly with our levels approach and indicates that we should lower or tighten some of the thresholds associated with each of our five levels.\"If following the WHO recommendations, levels will be based on cases per , population and the percentage of positive tests as core indicators, meaning the data in the above table details what we could expect, based on the cases per k.The Scottish Government also say they will continue to look at forecasts of hospital admissions and ICU occupancy, as well as patterns of infection in older people andthe ability of the NHS to resume paused serviced.According to their Strategic Framework update, the plan is to progress through the proposed easings for Level , \"at a pace that the data indicate is safe\", and from there to allocate protection levels again in accordance with geographical epidemiological data.They will look to the criteria set out by the World Health Organisation, and use it to assess whether it is safe to proceed with each new set of easings.However, they will also be adding one extra condition that they say \"must be met\" in addition to the six WHO criteria for easing lockdown.

Last week, it averaged. per centof the,tests reported.Family meet-ups could be back on the cardsSo what could change today It is expected that restrictions will be eased - but only on the number of people who can meet up outdoors.This is because the chances of passing on the virus are greatly reduced - but not eliminated - in the fresh air.At present, only two people from two households are allowed to socialise outdoors in Scotland.:Controversial Borders housing development proposal rejected by councillors#This was due to increase to four people from two households from March , but this is expected to be brought forward as a result of progress in suppressing new cases.This will allow more people to meet friends and family and could allow children to take part in some sports.What  is in the pipeline With some primary school pupils back at school and the rest expected to join them next week, opening up classrooms will continue.By late April, the government hopes to move back to a local \"levels\" system of regional restrictions across Scotland, albeitwith tougher rules than before.When will the statement be made The First Ministerwill address the Scottish Parliament around .pm.

At a time when Nicola Sturgeon’s press conferences dominate the airwaves and many national newspapers support one political party, local newspapers are a very important way for people of all shades of opinion to get their message across.I am very pleased that all the opposition parties worked together in the Scottish Parliament and got behind a motion which called on the SNP government to keep giving business rates relief to newspapers and to use its advertising budget to support regional and local newspapers.The SNP opposed this motion but fortunately it was passed by one vote.

We know spring will come as it always does, but will it be like last year  The coronavirus statistics are better, but will there be another surge Perhaps the hope from the emerging signs of spring or the increasing curb of coronavirus is not enough. Perhaps fear of catching the virus, of death coming knocking and of what lies beyond the grave are never far from your mind. Is there a hope to deal with these legitimate fears  The good news of the Christian message is that the answer is yes, there is.This week saw the start of Lent, a season that takes us on a journey of hope. #But how is Lent a journey of hope # you ask. Where does Lent end  With the historical events of Jesus’ death and resurrection. They are why you can have real hope. By his death, Jesus dealt with our sin and failure and defeated death so that we need no longer fear it. His triumph was confirmed by his physical, bodily resurrection.You can experience this hope by trusting in Jesus alone.

The company hopes to have the hotel open by mid summer.Key Leisure is part of the Premier Cuisine group which owns several pubs and hotels in the west of Scotland, including the Ingledene Hotel at Ardrossan.The hotel is to be called the Mull of Kintyre Hotel and Country Club. It will have  en-suite bedrooms and a leisure facility including a swimming pool, training room and sauna. Once it opens the development is expected to create  jobs.Mr Brian Morton, managing director of Premier Cuisine, said: #The group feels there is a lot of potential in the Campbeltown area for a hotel and country club of this standard.#He added the local golf courses would prove an attraction for visitors from North America and Europe.FIFTY YEARS AGOEditor#s note: The following article and this week#s photograph are used in historical context and should not be considered the view of today’s Campbeltown Courier. This was, unbelievably, the front page lead story  years ago.Hot pants# they are selling like hot cakesThe cries of despondency from the men of the world rang high when the midi and the maxi skirt looked like taking over from the miniskirt.For the past few ecstatic years, males in Campbeltown had been able to ogle at the lithe legs of the females and the thought of these lovely legs being covered abhorred these gentlemen.However, there is still hope for the leg brigade. Hot pants, it seems, are selling like hot cakes and it already looks like being a short summer!In Campbeltown, the shorts are selling well, especially among girls in their late teens.Most of the girls are buying them for wearing to dances # runner-up to Miss Campbeltown was wearing a pair of shorts # but already one or two have been spotted in the street during the day.The shorts cost, on average, about £. and are made from a iety of materials including denim, silk and wool. Shorts by themselves are going well but the bib type is selling best. The pants are also being worn with midi dresses and maxi coats thus giving the girls the best of both worlds. Popular colours are purple, black and red.Local drapers expect a big demand for the hot-pants in the summer and are stocking up accordingly.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOMishap to SS KinlochThe steamer Kinloch met with a mishap on the outward passage from Campbeltown on Monday, but fortunately it did not prove of a serious nature.When the steamer was approaching Lochranza, and was quite near to the pier, the eccentric shaft gave way, and the vessel had to drop anchor. The weather conditions were good.A telegram was dispatched for the services of a tug, and as the delay at the outset was likely to be considerable, a large number of the passengers landed and proceeded overland to Lamlash, where they caught a boat for the mainland.After a bit, the engineers were successful in effecting a temporary repair, and the Kinloch was able to resume the journey under her own steam.There was no interruption in the service on account of the accident, the necessary repair being completed in time to enable her to take up the inward run next day."},{"url":null,"title":"leader february 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It really will make a dference to our environment and is something that can be done easily on our daily walks.I would also like to say a big thank you to Jimmy Robertson, the bin man who contacted me and donated his litter-picker, bags and gloves. It is very much appreciated. I wish Jimmy a really happy retirement, and would like to thank him for all he has done over the years.I went back to work at MAKI Pups, the new outdoor nursery based in Lochgilphead, last week but I intend to continue with my litter-picking at weekends when I can. I won#t stop now I#ve started.If anyone wishes to help in any way, please phone me on  .There was an interesting letter from Ron Wilson in the February  edition of the Courier which, as with any politician#s pronouncements, was laced with spin, hyperbole or half truths and consequently tells only half the story.Regarding vaccines, nobody, except the SNP, talks about Westminster#s charity. It is my understanding that Great Britain and Northern Ireland are part of the UK and independently opted not to use the EU system and purchased vaccines for itself.This elicited the usual howls of derision by SNP politicians along the lines of: #This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic and will cost lives,# and others of a similar vein.The inept EU vaccine-purchasing system has been and still is chaotic. France, at the time of writing, with a population of  million, has vaccinated . million. Pro rata, under the EU system, Scotland would probably have received , as opposed to the . million currently vaccinated.The electorate keep hearing: #As an independent member of the EU#. This is possibly an SNP aspiration but I think there are several hurdles to an independent Scotland joining the EU.What currency would be used, what proposals are there to meet the EU fiscal rules for membership in respect of the annual GDP deficit which is currently running at . per cent, well above the three per cent required The last figures available for government debt to GDP of  per cent is well above the  per cent required. Then there is the strong possibility of a Spanish veto or perhaps they are proposing throwing Clara Ponsatí to the wolves and saying: #We are sorry we backed the Catalans in order to curry favour with Madrid.#Regarding the EU solidarity stimulus plan, I would hope that it was considerably greater than the UK there are  member countries. I understand that it is € billion, spread over three years, and the grants and loans are subject to strict requirements. I notice that you do not mention £. billion to date allocated through the Barnett formula which is separate from the money. I do not know how much, currently paid to Kate Forbes MSP, cabinet secretary for finance#s department in the furlough scheme.Regarding the comments relating to Brexiteers and leaving the EU as #Johnson#s folly#, it has obviously escaped Mr Wilson#s notice that leaving the EU, liking the decision or not, was a democratic one by the UK electorate and, unlike the EU or the SNP, in our constitution we do not send the electorate back to vote again until such time that they #vote correctly#.Banking crash  May I remind Mr Wilson that it was the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland which were the main protagonists in the UK which had a serious impact on our economy. Mr Wilson#s rather emotive #gimcrack imperial fantasies# could well have applied to the antics of the two Scottish banks# boards of directors.I am not particularly an avid supporter of politicians per se but the current SNP government by any yardstick is a really appalling administration with a record of declining education, health care and financial mismanagement, just to mention three areas.Leaving aside the first two, what should cause concern is the eye-watering amounts of taxpayers# money wasted. The new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh is at least £ million over budget and still not fully operative Ferguson Shipyard ferry project, currently £ million and no ferries, projected final cost an additional £ million and no firm delivery date other assorted projects like the BiFab yards, £ million, two of which have been bought by a UK company for £, Prestwick Airport, there is a bit of #smoke and mirrors# but somewhere around £ million is close.A bit closer to home, the Glen Croe problem up to the Rest and Be Thankful, which has been ongoing since  and is regularly subject to closure, has had at least £ million spent on it to date. It is of no surprise that Jim McColl said that #everything the SNP touch is a mess#. Added to that, we have the current internecine Salmond Sturgeon Murrell case ongoing currently swallowed up in excess of £, of taxpayers# money and rising.Mr Wilson is perfectly entitled to his point of view, as I am to mine, but as I said in my opening paragraph, and this applies to politicians of all political persuasions, please present the full narrative not some unsubstantiated wish list.The neglect of the A is a disgrace. It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago, we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said it would solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems.

God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth.#Timothy was to be a model of the Lord Jesus, the most loving man who ever lived and yet the one who disagrees with everyone. Disagrees  Really  Yes, Jesus# first word to the world in the gospel of Matthew is, #repent#, that is, #you are heading the wrong way, turn from sin to God.#Jesus isn’t addressing a particular section of society, or a particular behaviour, he is not directing his gaze at #everyone except me#. This is the most loving call in the world to everyone everywhere. And it#s good news because it comes from a saviour who paid for sin and who offers us the power to change.#I have come,# said Jesus, #that they may have le and have it in abundance.#His invitation  Come, find out how to live and how to love."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns colin joins team scotland staff","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

If we want children and families to come to the area we need to keep the school open,# he said.Argyll and Bute Council met yesterdaywhen members were asked to agree to hold informal pre-consultation meetings with representatives from  communities that may be affected by the school estate review.The council was also asked to agree to review the school estate #on an ongoing basis# and reducing the future scale of any changes which would be considered at any one time.Now the proposal is for Rhunahaorine to go into Glenbarr and Clachan and Skipness to go to Tarbert.

Not only because it#s convenient, but also to help the commercial centre of the town.#FIFTY YEARS AGOLocal choir on radioCampbeltown Gaelic choir was taped at a concert in the Town Hall on Tuesday evening.The choir will be heard on BBC radio later this month.BBC men recorded a half-hour programme of all-Gaelic songs, which were introduced by Mr Hector McNeill.The choir was conducted by Mr Charles Bonar.

This is in contradiction to what is surely the council#s main aim when setting the budget # saving money where possible.Despite many of KRL#s staff having barriers to working, they do an exemplary job and are happy in their workplace # something which is evident from a visit to the recycling centre. The fact that some of them may lose the jobs they enjoy and do so well as a result of this decision is shocking and heart-breaking.Campbeltown has seen record levels of redundancies over the last couple of years, with more than  lay-offs at CS Wind and Campbeltown Creamery alone, never mind the many people who have since lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. To potentially add to this level of unemployment for no apparent good reason is baffling.KRL not only provides an efficient and cost effective service but worthwhile jobs to people who may otherwise struggle to find employment and are no doubt very concerned about their futures right now.This decision should be reconsidered."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I immediately hung up # wondering which of my frailties had been discovered # and phoned  which tells you the last number that called.I twice noted the number given by  and ventured to phone it. On dialling this number, the phone company advised me that there was #no such number#.Over a week, adopting identical procedures, five dferent #no such numbers# were found. The job of answering morning calls was then delegated to the message answering machine and only once did it receive a call which was terminated speedily by the caller without a message.Is there a flaw in our phone companies# systems with consequent loss of income  If this flaw could be eradicated, phone scammers might be less numerous and consequently afford a little more protection for the vulnerable.Going by theof John Newall#s reply to my letter on England#s disastrous Brexit, forced upon Scotland against our democratic wishes, I had expected better than the mishmash of worn out tropes and John Bull exceptionalism trotted out by Mr Newall.Mr Newall makes great play of the successful roll-out of the Covid vaccine in Scotland and the UK. He is absolutely right, it has been a fantastic achievement, but to then go on to use this success to denigrate the EU#s vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic.Our success is an illusion until both doses of vaccine are administered, crowing about vaccines when only . per cent of the UK population has had the vital second jag, compared, for example, to . per cent in Denmark, is both presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Newall goes on to assert that Scotland has a deficit that will prevent Scotland re-entering the EU, without of course mentioning the elephant in the room, the UK#s ruinous £ trillion # and increasing # debt. Unionists need to get their own house in order before lecturing anyone .Of course, legally, Scotland has no #deficit# or #debt#. How can a country with virtually no borrowing ability have a debt  What Scotland does have is a notional #debt#, the price of Westminster failure within the UK, where spending outwith Scotland#s control is assigned to Scotland, such as Trident, HS and London’s Crossrail. Spending that Scots taxpayers cough up for.Indeed,Courier readers start counting now at the rate of one a second, they#ll reach the number of pounds spent on Boris Johnson’s failed Track and Trace system at about .am on April  in the year . Readers may well wonder where the money went and why this is being loaded on to Scotland#s ledger.Straight from the #Better Together# playbook, Mr Newall brings up the hoary old #Spanish veto# myth. The truth is that Spain has no issue with an independent Scotland in the EU so long as this is within the framework of the UK constitution # which it is.Unlike Catalonia#s predicament, Scotland is not a #region# of the UK, there is no constitutional prohibition on independence votes or indeed of Scotland abrogating the  Treaty of Union with England.This is why successive prime ministers, from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron, have repeatedly recognised the right of the Scottish people to independence # and why Boris Johnson#s oafish #No# will run into the sand.Mr Newall and I will never agree but that is the essence of democracy, and the right to choose in a free country.Scotland can either remain, semi-detached and impotent, as part of an increasingly insular Little Englander Tory Britain, bringing in its wake further austerity and diminished le chances for our young people, or Scots can vote for independence, just like our neighbours.Yes, there will be dficult choices, yes, there will be mistakes, but they will be our decisions to get right as we work for the prosperous, open and internationalist country that is within our grasp.I am delighted that our council will be investing nearly £. million to help keep Argyll and Bute going and growing.After relentless campaigning from myself and others it#s great to see, at long last, some substantial investment in our crumbling infrastructure.Building on investments made in previous years, an additional £. million will be invested to drive forward improvements and repairs to Argyll and Bute#s network of roads in rural, remote, island and urban communities, bringing the overall roads reconstruction budget to £ million for  .We are also investing more in active travel, in line with the council#s agreed priorities. This includes a further £, in enhancing and improving footpaths. This investment complements the current allocation of £, in green transport and travel.This recent Covid pandemic has highlighted more than ever the need to tackle our urban-rural ide. Even now, many of my constituents are paying primum prices for snail#s pace broadband speeds.That#s why £, is being invested in a Tackling Digital Exclusion Top-Up Fund # to support people, businesses and communities to access improved digital connections for social and commercial opportunities supporting communities and in some cases iniduals that are missing out on national programmes due to logistics and economies of scale.While this budget is not perfect and there will be challenges ahead as we start to recover from the ongoing global pandemic this is a massive step in the correct direction.Now my constituents across the Kintyre and the Islands ward will quite rightly want to see action, not more talking.So that means more help for our small businesses, improving our digital connectivity and substantial improvements to our roads which in so many areas are sadly approaching the point of no .Six years ago, I had a sudden and le-changing stroke. I’m not alone in this: stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and around . million survivors are living with its devastating effects.Despite this, research into stroke is severely underfunded.

There are some who will witness to the fact He speaks out loud to them and others who catch directions in the circumstances of everyday le, how doors open and close, through the advice of good friends and by the reaction of conscience to intentions.Those who read the Bible regularly and systematically, as opposed to opening it at random and sticking in a pin, are often amazed at how the passage for the day addresses the problems and circumstances of that day # and draw from that what they believe God is telling them.In I Kings chapter , we read of the Prophet Elijah feeling overwhelmed by the attacks of his enemies and the declaration of Queen Jezebel of a hunt to kill him. In the midst of his trauma, the word of the Lord comes to him, not in a great wind nor in an earthquake nor in a fire but in a low whisper.With all that has been going on around us over the past year, we too may be feeling overwhelmed. If we listen, we may hear God reminding us that He is always with us.

The owner just shrugged their shoulders and said, #What can I do #.#I know we cannot police these things without people#s names, but we need to be saying to the council that we must be getting out there.#Jim Smith, the council’s amenity services manager, responded: #By and large we have less of a problem than in some other areas, where it is quite disgusting.#I would say most dog owners are responsible and clean up after their dogs.#A social media campaign would assist and we will look at the council website as well to seemore information can be given out.#Councillor Currie added: #It is definitely a big problem in Argyll and Bute. It doesn’t matter where you go – it is all over the place.#I am being very strong here, but I think we need to be strong, and I would like to see a big push to try and pin down the owners, get them charged, and show people we mean business.#Social media may do some things but we will never get through to irresponsible dog owners.

Thank you for supporting us during this incredibly challenging time.I shall leave John Newall to respond to Ron Wilson#s letter in last week#s Courier,he so wishes, but I cannot let that letter from the Kintyre SNP secretary pass without comment from me regarding some factual errors contained therein.Mr Newall is quite correct in his assertion that Scotland#s deficit will be a major stumbling block to an independent Scotland joining the EU, and whatever debt the UK may or may not have is neither here nor there with regard to this. Mr Wilson is trying to muddy the waters there.Whilst Mr Wilson is correct that Scotland cannot have debt , Scotland does have deficit, and the reason we know this is because the SNP-run Scottish Government tells us so in the annual Government Revenue and Expenditure, Scotlandbut Mr Wilson contradicts himself by going on to say that Scotland has a #notional debt# . Scotland has no debt. Scotland cannot have debt. Mr Wilson needs to realise that debt and deficit are two dferent things.With regard to HS, yes, Scotland pays a two per cent share of the total cost but will receive approximately . per cent back in Barnett consequentials. THAT is a very good deal for Scotland. London#s Crossrail  Not a single penny for that will be paid for by Scotland.Mr Wilson goes on to say that there is no #prohibition on independence votes#. Another error from him. Section  of The Scotland Act , the act which allowed us to have a devolved assembly and to which the then Scottish Office signed up, lays down the exact process required. We need permission from HMGov.Oh, and the notion that Scotland can abrogate the Treaty Of Union is also wrong. Whilst Westminster is a parliament of equals, it cannot of itself dissolve the Treaty of Union of which it was not itself a progenitor. That is the prerogative of the suspended national parliaments of England and Scotland, which will require to be recalled from suspension #in abeyance ad interim# where they legitimately reside at the present time. Only the recalled national parliaments of Scotland and England may re-negotiate the  Treaty of Union.I would take this opportunity to remind Mr Wilson of two things: we had a referendum in  and voted to stay in the UK, and he should really learn to live with that and in no election ever, General or Scottish, has the SNP garnered more than  per cent of the vote.The decision by Argyll and Bute Council to stop funding Kintyre Recycling Limited is perverse to say the least.No thought seems to have been given to the level and cost of the future support for the employees who will be thrown on the scrap-heap. Will that go to the social work department and will they get the same level of support as they do now No thought seems to have been given to the effect on the mental health of the employees # what support will be available and what budget will it come from How can the expenditure of a quarter of a million pounds be justied when the council is struggling for money and how long will it take to save this amount compared with the partial funding for Kintyre Recycling Limited It is shameful that only two of our local councillors are against vulnerable people being thrown on the scrap-heap when all three should be supporting their constituents.I am pleased to support the new business group set up to campaign for a quick and permanent solution for the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A.It’s now seven months since the landslide closed the A last summer. That should have been a wake-up call for the SNP Government, but all we#ve had since then is a failed attempt to protect the Old Military Road from landslides and talk of taking  years to solve the problem.This is just not good enough. We need urgent action now.Last week#s Courier letters page didn#t offer much hope. The SNP only wrote about independence, not the real issues facing us, such as the Rest and Be Thankful.The SNP Government should be concentrating on fixing the Rest and Be Thankful and recovering from the Covid pandemic, not spending its time plotting about independence.This Mother#s Day, school feeding charity Mary#s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary#s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world#s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary#s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That#s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary#s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother#s Day.

A cat or rabbit in the house has given many people companionship they would not otherwise have had ndash but pets require lots of love, attention and care to ensure they are kept in the best of health.At Dunedin Vets, we are now seeing many lockdown pets who are adolescents and maturing. This is now the time to consideryou are going to have your pet neutered.This may sound very dramatic when your pet is still young but, in this world, where there are so many unwanted pets that often end up having to be destroyed, it is surely worth considering preventing this.In fact, there are also many health advantages to neutering your pet.This is especially true for female dogs. It prevents the messy situation of your bitch in season, which generally will be every six months. It also prevents the advances of the local male dog population, who can be very determined.I have heard of dogs scaling six-foot fences and chewing through doors to reach a bitch on heat. The determination of true love!Neuteringat an early age can prevent bitches developing le-threatening mammary tumours in later years. It also prevents the occurrence of a pyometra , which we see commonly in older, entire bitches. This condition generally requires emergency spaying, altogether a more traumatic procedure than spaying at an early age.Neutering females at the age of around six monthsis a fairly routine procedure and most owners are pleasantly surprised how quickly their pet recovers after the surgery.If bitches have been in season already, the best time to spay is three months after their season.This means the uterus and surrounding blood vessels will be at their smallest, making the operation less traumatic for the patient and the vet. If they are approaching their next season, we recommend postponing the operation until after the season to reduce the likelihood of complications.Sometimes, after a bitch has been in season, she will produce milk and show nesting behaviour, even though she is not pregnant. This is a perfectly normal phenomenon, a throwback to wild dogs, when some bitches without pups would produce milk to help feed the pups in the pack.We cannot, however, spay bitches during  pregnancies as they can continue producing milk indefinitely and be prone to mastitis and other conditions. If your bitch is in a  pregnancy when due to be spayed, hormones can be prescribed to dry the milk prior to neutering.When I spayed my Labrador Lucy at six months, I could not believe that she was wanting to chase a ball and play with her toys the following day. We do not advocate exercise for a few days post-operation, though.We ask for post-op photos to be emailed to us so we can assess the healing process. We usually provide collars to prevent animals interfering with their wounds I have to say, my Lucy chewed her collar and was not interested in the wound, but everyone is dferent.All animals before, during and after neutering are given suitable pain relief to ease their discomfort.We generally advocate neutering male dogs at around nine months of age. This allows them to mature and develop more male characteristics prior to castration.If you have a large breed dog, we would not advocate castration until at least  months of age, as they take much longer to mature.Some male dogs have only one descended testicle. If this is the case, we recommend neutering at the earliest age possible, as the abdominal or retained testicle can develop a cancer.Sometimes these can be quite tricky to find, as the lsquomissingrsquo testicle can be anywhere between the kidneyand the groin area. I have even found one down a back leg!If you have a show dog or are reluctant to neuter your male dog, there are hormone implants which can be injected into your dog every six months. This is a pretty painless procedure and it allows you to monitor how your dog would respond to neutering should the operation go ahead.When it comes to cats, both male and female cats can be neutered from around six months of age.There is no definite time nor age when they should be neutered.It does prevent tomcats from spraying to scent mark their territory and from wandering far from home. They are therefore less likely to get into fights and accidents, and become more biddable and loving.My colleague Chrisrsquos cat Marnie was up to mischief playing with his big brother Watson in the evening after his operation, with no ill effects whatsoever.An entire female cat can literally be the source of thousands of kittens over her letime. Female catscome into season from about six months of age and will keep coming into season every few weeks, especially over the summer months, until they are mated. It can therefore be dficult to spay them when they are not in season. Female cats should be at least kg in weight prior to their operation. This is known to reduce anaesthetic risks.The sutures are buried in the skin, but collars are recommended to prevent cats licking their wounds.Male and female rabbits can also be neutered from around six months of age. This prevents female rabbits from developing uterine cancer, which is relatively common in the older doe rabbit.Neutering male rabbits can help prevent some dominance and aggressive tendencies. It is best to consider neutering rabbits in the winter months, when their oies and testicles are least active. Rabbit anaesthetics do carry slightly more risk than with dogs and cats, but with careful monitoring and support they do very well and recover within a few days.It might not have been everyonersquos first thought when they acquired a new pet, but neutering generally makes animals more home-loving and biddable, and definitely prevents many problems in later le."},{"url":null,"title":"call-consultation-whether-haddingtons-new-20mph-speed-limit-made-permanent","story":"The reduced speed limit throughout the town ndash and others in East Lothian ndash was brought in last year in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris McEwan, chairman of Haddington and District Community Council, stressed the importance of members of the public having a say on whether the limits should remain in place.He said: ldquoNot everybody wanted a mph speed limit in Edinburgh when it was proposed.

A December poll in GPonline revealed that a third of GPs were facing \"very high\" levels of work-related pressure, a situation likely to worsen as the UK endures its second wave of coronavirus.While the added pressure brought on by the pandemic has triggered an immediate crisis for many within the profession, the environment for most GPs has been extremely challenging for many years, with numerous legacy issues still needing to be addressed beyond this current public health crisis.A lack of sufficient numbers of newly qualied GP candidates sits at the heart of the problem. It takes years to address this issue, meaning the UK public faces a decline in care standards or having to recruit additional experienced doctors from abroad, a costly process which denies poorer nations of much-needed medical skills.Here in Scotland, GP recruitment has been further set back by the Scottish Governmentrsquos attempted integration ohealth and social care alongside the implementation of its new GP contract. Under the new agreement, GP practices will continue to operate as private businesses with the partnersrsquo remuneration dependent on their level of profitability.The new agreement offers further Government support, in principle, by removing some of the risk burden from GP practice partners in running a business. It also provides more funding and reinstates the principle that doctors are expert medical generalists who should only focus on those patients who actually need to be seen by them.Some health boards are attempting to implement these policies but this has not been consistent across Scotland and progress has been slow. While this may be understandable in the current climate, failure to creating a stable working environment for GPs will lead to increased shortages and could trigger wider public health issues. The Scottish Government must therefore ensure all health boards take a consistent approach in implementing the new contract.There are also UK-wide issues for the Westminster Government to address which are currently preventing older GPs from working. While the Chancellorrsquos March  Budget took some steps towards addressing doctorsrsquo pensions earnings, issues around letime allowance limits still remain which are penalising experienced GPs who want to continue working beyond their retirement age.Andy Drane, partner and GP practice adviser at law firm Davidson Chalmers StewartAlong with the challenges it has brought to the profession, Covid also presents a real opportunity to revitalise GP service delivery through new, imaginative policies which will benefit those in the profession along with the wider public. However, Scottish and UK governments must firstly focus on removing the increasing level of burden that many doctors are currently facing.Given the essential role of GPs in safeguarding public health, politicians and policy-makers must ensure this is a key health priority.Andy Drane is partner and GP practice adviser at law firm Davidson Chalmers Stewart"},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-palace-cannot-allow-meghans-accusation-racism-stand","story":"The Queen is still the Head of State in our constitution, as well as head of the Church of England.

Her tale of victimhood has reverberated across the world and particularly in the Commonwealth of former British colonies. Nothing could be more damaging than the head of the Commonwealth being tainted with racism.Meghan has at her back an army of international celebrities led by Hillary Clinton, who accused the royals of ldquooutrageous cruelty astheyd held Meghan in a dungeon in the Tower. Brexit Britain was already being portrayed by the US media as a reactionary and xenophobic place. Now comes confirmation from within.It hardly matters that much of what the Duchess said was nonsense. She claimed that during her pregnancy she was not allowed to visit her friends and was only allowed out twice in four months. If thats true the royals were guilty of coercive control, a criminal offence. The isolation, she said, contributed to her mental health problems and resulted in ldquosuicidal thoughts for which she was given ldquono support.She said that she approached the human relations office and was told they couldnt help because she wasnt an employee. This is hardly surprising. The Sussexes had their own private office staffed by well-paid people whose job it was to look after her welfare. They could have bought the best psychiatric help on the planet. Her husband, Harry, even co-founded a charity for people with mental health issues, Heads Together. Did he ignore his own wes psychological deterioration Meghan complained that her son, Archie, had been blackballed by the Palace because of ldquoconcerns about his colour. She says she was told he would not automatically be a prince, which is true since the Queens great-grandchildren dont automatically take on the title. Archie could become a princeand when Charles, his grandfather, becomes king.But this was not about protocol, but race. She connected the unspecied ldquoconversations about his skin colour with the fact that Archie was being deprived of his royal title ndash at risk to his le. Its not clear which she thought was worse: the racism or the fact that she was told, again during her pregnancy, that her son would not have police protection.Was she suggesting here that her protection officers would have been withdrawn because Archie was not immediately to become a prince  That is plainly wrong. The royal protection squad would never have been taken from Prince Harry and his family while he remained an active royal. Security costs only became an issue when the couple said they wanted to leave, ldquostand back, from their royal roles and seek their fortunes in Canada and America. They couldnt have it both ways and continue to be funded by UK taxpayers after theyd departed for La La Land.Read more: Its time to abolish the monarchyIn one of many startling revelations Harry said: ldquoMy family literally cut me off financially....

Harry had around pound million from investments left by his mother and Meghan had her own millions. They are getting poundm from Netflix and Spoty. Harry said that ldquogoing to the streamers was never part of the plan. Perhaps not, but since they intended to earn large sums of money to pay for their pound million Santa Barbara mansion, media work must have been in the back of their minds.There were predictable claims of racism in the British media. The press is disrespectful, sometimes cruelly so but, unlike social media, claims of actual racism against Meghan have never been substantiated. Yet the Duchess is now offering concrete proof that the royal family itself, the pinnacle of state privilege, is racist. Just how ldquodark would Archie be This was the cruellest cut of all, and one the Palace cannot allow to stand. The context of the remark, or remarks, was not made clear. It was Prince Harry who heard it and he was refusing to ldquoshare any more of the story. Yet hed already shared the greatest possible libel of his own family. There can be no charge more damaging to a institution today than that it harbours racists.Could it have been a misunderstanding  I was once accused of racism for saying that, when watching her legal drama Suits, it had never occurred to me that Meghan was black. It was only after she hooked up with Harry that I learned she was a Person of Colour. Butit was a similarly misconstrued remark, the Palace should make that clear.

A deadline has been set for next month and any cities that dont meet the criteria for allowing fans back into grounds face being cut from the list of hosts.I sincerely hope that Hampden will be able to play its part in the Euros and we donrsquot want the impact of Covid to deny us that. If we donrsquot do the right things over the period of time until the Euros actually come around, or until a decision is made, then there is always that fear.We have to be on our best behaviour and we donrsquot want to find ourselves in the situation where Hampden doesnrsquot get the games.I donrsquot want to get into the politics of the situation but as football fans we will be disappointedthis decision goes against us. The Government run the rule here and it is a health issue before it is a sporting issue.There are some things that we can argue and some that we canrsquot win the case on and there is no doubt thatthe decision isnrsquot favourable then there will be fractures in those relationships.It would be a cruel blow to Steve Clarke and the players and certainly to the Tartan Army as well. You can see the impact that no fans has had on teams throughout the pandemic and some sides have lost that edge playing in front of empty stands.The Tartan Army havenrsquot had something like this to look forward to for so long now and the world will be wanting to see the Scotland support at it is best. We would all love to see that and to see the Tartan Army supporting a successful Scotland side.When the Euros were postponed last summer due to the pandemic, very few people would have thought that we would be in this situation all these months on. It is mind-boggling and so sad and frustrating.The virus has continued to evolve and there are new strains and iants and we are still living under restrictions. It has looked for some time that the vaccine will be the savour and hopefully that is still the case.At the moment, I would hope that the talk about not playing games at Hampden is just scaremongering and a ploy to keep us all on our toes to ensure we continue abiding by the rules.At the end of the day, it is probably above the head of the SFA andthe Government say that it is a no-go then that will be final unfortunately.It is obvious that powerful voices matter, though, and Stevie Clarke, as Scotland manager, has a powerful voice. I am sure he will sit down with whoever he needs to and put forward a caserequired but it will be a decision that is outwith his control. He will be in the talksneeded but that final decision will come from above.When it comes to health, the Government has to do what they have to do and that has to always be the priority. That is a given and everyone will realise that.But you can only hope that there will be a situation where the crowds can be back at games sooner rather than later. I donrsquot think we will see a , sell-out at Hampden with the way that things are going unfortunately though.The decision has to be made at the last minute possible to give Glasgow every chance to prove that it can host these fixtures. As football people, we will always make the case for it because it is our livelihood, our raison decirctre, and we must do everything we can here.The Scotland fans have been building up to this tournament for so long and the governing bodies that make these decisions have to do everything they can to make it happen.We know it probably wonrsquot be full houses but we need the approval of the Government and the SFA to make sure that can abide by the guidelines that UEFA have set out.In terms of the revenue that it will bring to Glasgow and Scotland, of course there is a compelling case for having these fixtures at Hampden. And there is the huge boost that it will give to the morale of the nation as well.But the health consideration has to be the most important one and that will be first and foremost I am sure.I know there will be meetings ongoing over the next few weeks and hopefully by the time a decision has to be made Scotland will be in a much better state thanks to the vaccine.We will be governed by the scientists and the numbers of infections. It is all a numbers game. I am sure the Government wonrsquot want to take a chance here.For me, the only saviour I have seen for months now has been the vaccine because we have been in lockdown two or three times and it felt like it was back to the future every time. I always thought it wouldnrsquot start improving until the vaccine programme was rolled out and effective.That could be the savour in terms of getting the Euros to Glasgow, but more importantly hopefully that is the savour in terms of Scotland moving out of this pandemic as quickly as possible."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-address-certain-celebrity-couple","story":"WE recently revealed that broadcaster Neil Oliver iniably receives his mail, even when the address on the envelope is exceedingly vague.Paisley reader Mary Christie is curious to knowother celebrities also receive letters sent with an imprecise address.

He is surely right that ldquonothing less than a revolution in the way Whitehall acts and thinks is required, and is spot on when he points out that dferent parts of the UK require dferent policies, whether for education, labour markets, immigration or many other fields.His analysis, though, stops short at the civil service. Unfortunately this inflexibility pervades the whole body politic in Westminster, and a revolution is required in the political sphere too. For example, take immigration: Tory policy is to try to reduce it, and the Conservative Party plays on this repeatedly and everywhere in its messaging. How can they possibly reconcile this with a nuanced policy of encouraging it in Scotland and parts of England, while railing against it in others This is the way the UK political system works. If the civil service finds it hard to adapt its ldquodelivery to dferent parts of the UK, that is because it is the servant of UK politicians whose whole instinct is for bold, sweeping measures. Westminster politicians, seeing themselves reflected and magnied by a metropolitan media, are trapped in this mode. They want to be seen as ldquoworld-beating and ldquoglobal. This is the ambition that Whitehall has to indulge.Asking Boris Johnson to be otherwise is to plead forlornly against nature. Tasking him with making Scotland ldquofeel hellip part of a shared endeavour asks for the impossible. Itrsquos not just Mr Johnson, though. Any UK PM is ineluctably drawn towards grandiosity, because the Westminster London universe implicitly demands it. Careful attention to Scotland, Wales or English regions gets you nowhere in that world.The remedy, Lord Dunlop, is to leave it.Lyn Jones, Edinburgh.POLICE LACKED LEADERSHIPI AM moved to write this letter by a sense of incredulity at the events surrounding Rangers fans celebrations at winning the Scottish Premiership.First, it has to be acknowledged that the sporting achievement is certainly a signicant event for the club for which they have to be congratulated. However, as a retired former police officer I am appalled at the police handling of the ious incidents. In my view it highlights the inappropriate strategy of promoting officers with limited operational experience to positions of strategic control.When we see photographs of police officers having selfies taken with people forming part of an illegal mob, escorting the same mob to the main focal point of the city to celebrate illegally and indeed openly engage in ious aspects of illegal activity, then we simply have to speak out. Who is setting the standards Where was the leadership to make decisions on what was a slowly developing situation  They had the time it takes to slowly walk from Govan to the city centre to decide what to do, yet did nothing to stop the illegalities. This is a personal affront to me as a former member and an embarrassment to those taking good money to be entrusted with our protection. I believe I can say with confidence that in my day, the early s, this would never have happened, as the police would have simply refused to accept it and tackled the group head on with the confidence that we would have had the support of our experienced leaders rather than worry about any careerists who simply donrsquot know what to do.Unfortunately, there seems to me to be a cadre of senior officers who are more worried about their next promotion than in looking after our wellbeing.The demands of society havenrsquot changed in hundreds of years. People still lean out their windows shouting for help and ldquoGet me the Polis\", not ldquoGet me the statistical quality analytical unit.If these senior officers arenrsquot confident to carry out their duties, I know a number of very senior retired officers who would be more than happy toand advise.Brian Murphy, Glasgow.BLAME LIES WITH THE FANSIT is utter nonsense for Nicola Sturgeon, and indeed, for other members of the Holyrood Parliamentthey support the SNP line on this, to put the blame squarely on Rangers for this past weekendrsquos crowded fan street celebration . That is squarely on the fans themselves.The Government canrsquot stop mass gatherings in any circumstance ndash even the present Covid pandemic ndashthe public are intent on going out to themso how on earth is a vastly smaller entity such as a football club going to do so Rather, I see this as a cynical attempt to ert the attention of the public from the SNPrsquos in-fighting woes.

The rate of side-effects was less than expected from any of the clinical trials.: It was incredible news: Dozens of people in Glasgow learnthey were protected from Covid-Nurses involved in the care of adults with congenital heart disease said there had been reports of some patients suffering irregular heart beatsafter vaccinations.A  of experts drawn together to comment on the findings, said it was reassuring that those with underlying health conditions were no more likely to suffer side-effects than healthier iniduals.The app asks participants to record the date of vaccinations and any side-effects and found that in some cases symptoms were actually Covid- infections.Eli Barnes, a professor ofexperimental medicine at Oxford University, said: \"The side effects that you get are related to your innate immune response, which is your immune systems first line of defence to either an infection or to a vaccine.\"That is quite a separate thing from the kind of T-cells and antibodies that protect you from subsequent infection later on, which takes much longer to evolve.\": Coronavirus: Estimated  Scots living with cancer as experts warn many cases will be detected too lateProf Barnes said that while both vaccines were considered safe for patients with weakened immune systems, it is not yet known howeffective they are for patients in this group including those with cancer.New real-world data published yesterday found cancer patients are much less protected against Covid- than other people after one dose of the Pfizer vaccine.Three weeks after one dose, an antibody response was found in % of people with solid cancers, compared to % of people with no cancer.Dr Sheeba Irshad, oncologist and senior study author from Kings College London, said the findings were \"really worrying\" and cast doubt on whether cancer patients should face a -week wait for the second dose.Up to  patients are being recruited in three cities including Glasgow to investigate the efficacy of the vaccine in patients with compromised immunity.Prof Barnes said there were \"interesting\" reasons why more women were more likely to report vaccine side-effects.She said: \"The two genders have a dferent immune system to some extent.

Because it is.But, unashamed, the UK Governmentrsquos argument is  the SNP, despite its rhetoric, does not believe in devolution, ie sharing power, because it wants to have it all in an independent Scotland and  it has used the devolved settlement not to improve Scotsrsquo lives but merely to further the push for independence.This week, the mother of all shovels-in-the-ground projects was highlighted with the UK Government announcing that a multi-billion plan for a bridge or tunnel across the Irish Sea would be scoped by two top civil engineering experts.It may come as a surprise to some that a plan for a ldquofixed link across the Irish Sea is not new.As long ago as  when the Act of Union between Britain and Ireland came into being, William Pitt, the PM, had a doozy of an idea to build a bridge between Holyhead and Dublin to cement the new relationship, quite literally.A century later, architects were eagerly drawing up grand designs not for a bridge but an undersea tunnel in the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland.In , when a Tory MP in the Commons enquired about the project, Arthur Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury, told his colleague dryly: ldquoThe financial aspects...are not of a very promising character.Yet the dream persisted.MPs throughout the th century continued to broach the possibility of a tunnel across the Irish Sea.While the Dublin Government insisted it would not be economically viable, the idea was revived by Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionists, who even made a feasibility study into a tunnel or bridge a precondition of their support for the UK Government in the event of a hung parliament in the  General Election. Thankfully perhaps for David Cameron, the Tories won a majority.But it was when the idea was resurrected by an academic three years later that Borisrsquos imagination suddenly took flight and he insisted a bridge would create a ldquoCeltic powerhouse fuelled by increased trade across the water.By the time he became PM in summer , Mr Johnson was firmly committed to exploring the fixed link idea, hence this weekrsquos scoping plan in the Union Connectivity Review.However, of the two options a road bridge seems the unlikeliest.As one engineering expert pointed out maintaining a -milelong bridge would be an even greater task than building it. Costs would be ldquoeye-watering, he warned.And to put the scheme into context, a Celtic Crossing on this scale would make it the second longest road bridge in the world after the Bang Na Expressway in Bangkok. It cost poundm back in .So, a tunnel then This project would be comparable into the Eurotunnel but it has been pointed out it would have to be erted to avoid Beaufortrsquos Dyke, a ,ft deep trench, which is loaded with more than m tonnes of munitions dumped there from the days of the Second World War.The Eurotunnel cost pound.bn to build a new version would cost at least three times that today. So, a Union Tunnel would be one of the biggest infrastructure projects ever to be built in the UK. From the PMrsquos point of view, it would solidy the ldquowonderful Union and be part of his legacy alongside Brexit.But will Britain, and more specically Scotland, buy into the Unionist vision of a Strategic Transport Network with better road, rail, air and sea links, making the UK a simpler place to get around.On Wednesday, the Scottish Secretary snapped that the Scottish Government was ldquopathetic for not engaging in the connectivity review because its title contained the dreaded word lsquoUnionrsquo while Michael Matheson, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, huffed that transport was a devolved issue, dismissing the fixed link idea as Borisrsquos ldquovanity project.While some people will admire the PM for his Panglossian outlook, others will feel the idea of a Union Tunnel will simply go the same way as those much-loved flights of fancy: the Boris Island airport hub the garden bridge across the Thames and le grand pont to la belle France.All of which have been quietly filed away in a distant Whitehall drawer under B for bonkers."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12403340.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sas-red-notice-outlanders-sam-heughan-action-role-rival-james-bond","story":"The Outlander star, , plays special forces operator Tom Buckingham in SAS: Red Notice, an adaptation of former SAS soldier Andy McNabrsquos novel of the same name.:Outlanders Sam Heughan inspires fundraising duo to raise pound, for Lyceum TheatreThe film finds Buckingham on a train to Paris in the Channel Tunnel when it is hijacked by heavily armed mercenaries, who hold all the passengers hostage.Heughan, best known for his role as Highland warrior Jamie Fraser in the historical drama Outlander, explained that filming the movie had been \"very physical.\"He said: ldquoIt is an action movie and there are a lot of fights but strangely I loved it.

That appeal has been held up due to COVID- restrictions and remains within the appeals system.With reserves now running low at Cursiter, OIC is now urgently attempting to maintain supply hence the ,-tonne order, and now, this new order.Meanwhile, an internal OIC investigation is currently taking place to understand the methods in which the Glensanda stone was procured, with its findings set to be heard at the next meeting of the council#s monitoring and audit committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This ensures that local authorities are fully funded to operate their internal ferry services.“This delivers a key ask from the Scottish Government#s local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Of course for Orkney it facilitates the introduction of Sunday services and Road Equivalent Tarfon inter-island ferries.“The Scottish Government has stated that it is well aware of the growing need for local authorities to replace ageing ferry fleets and infrastructure. While responsibility for funding replacement infrastructure remains with the councils, Scottish Ministers are committed to continuing engagement.“The passing of the budget also means £. million is coming Orkney Islands Council’s way, up £. million on last year — a . per cent hike.”Both Mr Leslie and Orkney#s MSP, Liam McArthur, welcomed increased spending in areas such as mental health services, education, green initiatives, business support and agri-environment.Mr Leslie added: “I am sure folk across Orkney will join me in welcoming this budget, there is plenty in it for islanders to be pleased about as we look to build a better, fairer and greener future for us all.”Meanwhile, Mr McArthur welcomed a number of concessions included in the budget, notably the additional funding for Orkney#s internal ferry services.But he says this now needs to be a long-term commitment from the Scottish Government and backed by support for new vessels.Commenting on the budget, Mr McArthur said: “Over the last year, along with my Scottish Liberal Democrat colleagues, I have sought to hold the government to account over its handling of this crisis. I have done so, however, constructively and with the interests of supporting constituents and our community at the forefront.“That approach has remained the same during this year’s budget negotiations and I’m pleased that we’ve secured funding for a number of areas that will be important for our country’s recovery. A signicant increase in investment for mental health services, for example, delivers on a key ask from the Scottish Liberal Democrats as we look to address our country’s mental health crisis.“The additional funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services is also very welcome after years of broken promises and Orkney being short changed.  It’s vital, though, that this is not just a one-off pre-election gesture but part of a long term commitment by government that also includes addressing the urgent need for new vessels.“Meantime, I’m glad that cross-party agreement could be reached on this budget at a time when politicians from all parties should be absolutely focused on putting the recovery first.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Centralisation remains the most expensive and most economically damaging option and yet HIAL are determined to continue with it.“The proposal of yet another independent study on generating further economic activity falls far short of what is required here. HIAL should immediately pause this project and commission a genuinely independent report considering the feasibility of an alternative localised model,they refuse to do so then the Scottish Government must step in.“This is a major test of the credibility of the Islands Act which was intended to stop projects like this and ensure organisations considered less damaging alternatives. If organisations are allowed to simply ignore these Assessments then the whole Act will be rendered little more than a PR exercise.”On the issue of staffing he added: “The report also confirms Prospect own survey which found that staff in island communities will not relocate to Inverness. HIAL need to explain how they intend to live up to their promise of no compulsory redundancies as all evidence suggests that widespread redundancies now seem inevitable.#While HIAL has claimed that the report proves that an alternative local surveillance solution is #not viable#, Prospect fundamentally disagrees with this assessment.Mr Avery said: “HIAL’s claim that local implementation is not viable or that this report endorses their position is simply not true. This report states HIAL’s position, it very clearly does not endorse it. Any attempt to claim the contrary is just more desperate spin.“Local implementation of air traffic services including surveillance is how air traffic is implemented at almost every airport across the UK including at HIAL’s own Inverness airport. It is a viable workable and resilient alternative but HIAL refuse to consider it.#Meanwhile, HIAL has promised to engage with local authorities across the Highlands and Islands region as it seeks to deliver #viable solutions# to secure the future of leline air services.The company#s managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “We have always known there would be impacts by undertaking such a signicant and complex change management programme.“To date, there have been no alternative proposals that provide a solution that fully addresses all of the challenges HIAL currently faces.”“We hope that everyone with a vested interest in the long-term future of air traffic services in the Highlands and Islands will work us to deliver viable solutions that will maintain leline services and essential connectivity for generations to come.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is always a balanced decision that requires a host of issues to be taken into consideration.Here are a few things to consider for those asked to respond to Stornoway Community Council’s consultation.The island grid, supplied by a shaky distribution link from Fort Augustus through Skye, is full to capacity and closed to new connections – it has been for years.SSEN have decided to replace the failed Skye to Harris cable with a like-for-like kV cable.The new kV cable will offer  per cent more export capacity, enough to provide firm connections for our existing community generators .SSEN will not build a second kV cable without solid demand for it, in terms of prospective wind farms with approved planning permission and solid grid connection contracts.This effectively means that the only way to achieve additional capacity for the islands is to back the planned MW transmission link with its MW of ‘headroom’ for future projects.Only the commercial wind farms, Stornoway Wind Farm, Uisenis Wind Farm and Druim Leathann Wind Farm , have the financial wherewithal to underwrite the planned transmission link .Ofgem will authorise the transmission link onlyStornoway Wind Farm goes ahead.• Any attempt to derail Stornoway Wind Farm is an attempt to derail the £ million deep water terminal, since it is premised on a renewables and a hydrogen economy.With no transmission link, no commercial wind farms, no community wind farms, no low cost electricity, continued dependence on imported fossil fuels, an undermined deep water terminal, an undermined Arnish fabrication yard and a hydrogen economy set back by ten years what is the alternative I love my wild and unspoilt vistas, my beaches and my hills as much as the next islander.I’d love the notion of population growth and sustainability, based on gin, tweed, tourism, crofting and salmon farming to be a reality but it isn’t.There needs to be, and I’ve said this before, a ‘mix’ of the strands that make up the fabric of our island#s economy.And we need to add another strand to move in anyway the right direction to reverse the current trend.There are several sides to every argument.We count the peatland, the visual impact and the hen harriers on the one hand and all the rest, outlined above, on the other.We take everything on board and hope that we are making the right choices for the benefit of more than just Stornoway.If there are any better alternatives, they’ve managed to remain hidden from view for far too long."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARMADALE-STORES-OPEN-1-scaled.jpg","title":"new shop opens its doors in south","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhen the old shop, post office and petrol station closed in , the Sleat Community Trading board, management and staff expected to be operating out of their temporary container in Ardvasar for six months.Covid caused understandable delays, but eighteen months later the staff have now left their cold and draughty temporary shop behind.Shop and post office manager Mhairi Cousins said: “I can’t praise the staff, board and volunteers highly enough.

We’re not complaining about that — the ferry pays its dues — but we have to find a way of reconciling the effect that has on Ullapool#s tourist trade because the place where visitors congregate to admire the loch and the view is Shore Street.In addition, the -year-old sea wall will be replaced with a higher structure to protect the village from rising sea levels.As part of the pre-application consultation, an online Zoom meeting will be held tonight at pm when the proposals will be presented for the first time and as many people as possible are being urged to take part.To join the meeting people can visit the website: http:www.ullapool-harbour or phone    and enter meeting ID:  to listen in.Anyone who wishes to make representations can do so by contacting Fiona Henderson, Affric Limited, Lochview Office, Loch Duntelchaig, Farr, IV AW, or by email: consultation@affriclimited, by th March ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ARCHIVE-CENT-ANGUS-OG-6.jpg","title":"chust lovely angus og finds a new home in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe collection of the comic strips were handed over to the Skye and Lochalsh Archive Centre in Portree, in recognition of Angus Òg creator Ewen Bain and his family links to Skye.Ewen was brought up in Maryhill, Glasgow but his father John hailed from Waternish and his mother Flora from Staffin.

Neil Gibson, who is chief economist with EY Ireland, said businesses will be able to compete for funds as we exit lockdown.The potential for a strong consumer recovery is signicant with perhaps £bn of consumer spending but we have to be mindful that not all of that will flow back in so there is the potential for prices to rise quite signicantly, which will bring challenges, he said. A phasedto full-time office working is planned for step three of the Executive plan for easing Covid- restrictions.However, analysis of day-to-day costs shows the financial benefits from home-working.At the start of the pandemic last March, fuel prices fell to their lowest level since the  financial crash. The AA had reported last February that Northern Ireland had the lowest prices in the UK, amounting to .p per litre for unleaded on average, and diesel at .p per litre.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNeil Gibson, chief economist with EY Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNeil Gibson, chief economist with EY IrelandA motorist with an average commute of , miles a year and a car that drives around  miles per gallon of petrol would save over £, in petrol costsasked to work at home.Many office workers enjoy a coffee to start the day. In one of Northern Ireland#s more ubiquitous cafes, Costa, a medium cappuccino costs £.. Buying just one cappuccino a day for  days of the year - which does not account for weekends or  days of holidays - will cost £. In comparison, a coffee made by a Nespresso machine at home costs anything from p to p per pod and a spend of £ a year for two drinks per working day alone in comparison. Or Lidl#s Deluxe Columbian Roast and Ground Coffee weighs in at £.. For a bag a week, this will cost £. a year. At lunchtime, workers may avail of a £ meal deal at supermarket chain Tesco, around £ a yearbought daily. Lunch still needs to be eaten at home and a g block of cheese will cost £. at the same supermarket. Buying a loaf of bread for less than a pound and a packet of ham for £ on average, will provide lunch for the week - and some money to spare. Commuters could also save, with an adult travelling by bus from Antrim to Belfast city centre usually being charged £. for a Translink  journey ticket. From Ballyclare to Belfast, a Smartlink ticket is £ or to travel from Coleraine to Belfast by train is £ for a monthly ticket. Even in the Belfast area, a dayLink ticket costs £ for a working week, adding up to £ a month. The American financial planner Pete Dunn has said % of our take-home pay should be spent on clothing. For those earning the average Northern Ireland wage of £, a year, take home pay might be in the region of £, a month. That equals £ a month for clothing. We can now get away with wearing leggings to our desks and are left with £, annually. Many households have found their spend on utilities has increased, having amounted to £- a year for electricity and £ to almost £ for gas or £. on average for  litres of home heating oil before lockdown, according to the Consumer Council. These bills can see a signicant bump now double the time is being spent there during the day. In the financial year ending March , UK households spent £ per week on activities now largely prevented by coronavirus restrictions, allowing room for spending or making up shortfall in other areas. HMRC has now launched a microservice that means even those required to work at home for just a day can claim tax relief for being asked to do so, accepting expense claims for a full tax year worth £ or £ depending on your tax bracket.Dr Esmond Birnie, a senior economist at Ulster University, said those of us who are now working largely from home have gained by not having to pay or spend time commuting, a reduced spend on lunch and relaxed dress code - but we have had to spend in other areas. In the opposite direction, perhaps more is being spent on heating the house, running gadgets, buying paper and ink for the printer and even getting more practical furniture, he said.Belfast Most ReadEntire terrace of Belfast homes is infested with rats, says councillorNI judges killed by IRA should be beatied by Pope, says ex-Provo bomberBBC#s Stephen Nolan says many of , signing petition to cancel show #anonymous and made-up names#Davy  scandal: The Belfast developer in eye of Republic#s financial stormMy run-in with Piers Morgan was horric, admits Apprentice star Grainne McCoyTop VideosPlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayMichelle O#Neill ‘fell asleep’ during Harry and Meghan interviewLatest CoronavirusNobody should be #greedy# with stocks of Covid vaccine, says O#NeillStruggling NI hospitality trade welcomes rates holiday extensionBallymena shop offers to visit homes to measure up young children for footwearMother#s Day and St Patrick#s Day celebrations could delay fullof schools, warns O#NeillPublic urged to be #very careful# celebrating Mother’s Day and St Patrick’s DayLatest from Belfast Bullring owner Hammerson reveals worst year for rents on recordMarcelo Bielsa won’t reveal reason behind Kiko Casilla’s absence at West HamForeign Office urges Britons to flee Myanmar due to violence from military coupLG to invest billions in US battery business amid electric cars driveTyson Fury says Anthony Joshua fight is ‘nowhere near’ being finalised,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amanda Wallace - mum of Laceyand Lily- said the visiting service was amazing. My kids are in McKillens every four or five months to get their feet measured. They grow that quickly and I was wondering how would I get them done, she said. You can buy in Tesco or Asda but I think footwear is one of the most important things you can fit for your child. Wearing ill-fitting shoes isn#t great for their development. I#ve been going to McKillens since my eldest child got her first shoes. My kids like to pick their own and within a couple of hours they had new shoes.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseShoes: Amanda Wallace FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueShoes: Amanda WallaceIt was a pleasant and efficient service. You wouldn#t get the service in a supermarket and McKillens didn#t charge for delivery. For a door-to-door service, it was amazing.Mr McKillen said well-fitting footwear is vital for youngsters because it affects their development and walking.Small children grow every eight weeks on average and we#ve been in lockdown for longer than that. I#ve had a couple of customers I sorted out in January who said their children have already grown out of their shoes. Feet don#t stop growing in lockdown, he said. The service started after the family-run business approached the Department of Health to askchildren#s first shoes could be deemed an essential health requirement, but this was refused. They listened but gave a generic response to say essential retail stores selling food are also allowed to sell shoes, he said.Offering click-and-collect wouldn#t solve the issue as children need to be measured to be fitted properly for shoes, he said. The father-of-two said first shoe measurements are also a milestone for parents. You need to fit the feet properly because they can develop problems.The Department of Health said: From  March, a controlled #click and collect# service for retail can operate for baby equipment, clothing, footwear and electrical goods. Retail bodies worked closely with the Executive to develop an approach that has allowed these particular businesses to operate contactless click and collect services in a safer, regulated manner.Belfast Most ReadEntire terrace of Belfast homes is infested with rats, says councillorNI judges killed by IRA should be beatied by Pope, says ex-Provo bomberBBC#s Stephen Nolan says many of , signing petition to cancel show #anonymous and made-up names#Davy  scandal: The Belfast developer in eye of Republic#s financial stormMy run-in with Piers Morgan was horric, admits Apprentice star Grainne McCoyTop VideosPlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayMichelle O#Neill ‘fell asleep’ during Harry and Meghan interviewLatest Northern IrelandDonaldson backs #terric# Conservative plan to see NI host House of Commons meetingsHughes Insurance moves staff to permanent home working with more jobs and cash paymentBoris Bridge: Foster left bemused by critics of proposed Northern Ireland-Scotland connectionNI man admits assaulting two Quinn executives days after father lost job at firmStockbroker Davy to be sold in wake of scandal Latest from Belfast Tyson Fury says Anthony Joshua fight is ‘nowhere near’ being finalisedOld Firm game could be postponedassurances not given, says YousafEFL delivers one million food parcels to support people in needDonaldson backs #terric# Conservative plan to see NI host House of Commons meetingsIran arrests producers in pop music video crackdown,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You are entitled to say you don’t like it and there will always be a place for you to do so,” said Mr Nolan.“I’m absolutely comfortable with giving you a  to criticise me and criticise this show.“I am not comfortable talking about some anonymous entity which has launched a tirade of abuse against women from that anonymous account.“That has celebrated the fact that they have trolled many, many people – including Arlene Foster.“It is an account that has celebrated the fact that they have trolled many people. That’s the bottom line.“There is a big conversation to be had in Northern Ireland about people who get abuse online.” Belfast Most ReadEntire terrace of Belfast homes is infested with rats, says councillorNI judges killed by IRA should be beatied by Pope, says ex-Provo bomberBBC#s Stephen Nolan says many of , signing petition to cancel show #anonymous and made-up names#Davy  scandal: The Belfast developer in eye of Republic#s financial stormMy run-in with Piers Morgan was horric, admits Apprentice star Grainne McCoyTop VideosPlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayMichelle O#Neill ‘fell asleep’ during Harry and Meghan interviewLatest Northern IrelandDonaldson backs #terric# Conservative plan to see NI host House of Commons meetingsHughes Insurance moves staff to permanent home working with more jobs and cash paymentCo Down man Colm Quinn dies after construction site accident in AmericaBoris Bridge: Foster left bemused by critics of proposed Northern Ireland-Scotland connectionNI man admits assaulting two Quinn executives days after father lost job at firmLatest from Belfast McIlroy has no answers to slump in form as he shoots a horror  in first round of Players ChampionshipMyanmar junta kills more protesters and makes new accusation over Suu KyiCo-chairman Avram Glazer puts some of his Manchester United shares up for saleBullring owner Hammerson reveals worst year for rents on recordMarcelo Bielsa won’t reveal reason behind Kiko Casilla’s absence at West Ham,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I#m somewhat bemused by the fact that our Infrastructure Minister does not think it is a good thing. You would think that the Infrastructure Minister would welcome the fact that government is focusing on infrastructure across the UK.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePrime Minister Boris JohnsonGetty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePrime Minister Boris JohnsonMs O#Neill however, described a bridge or tunnel as a pipe dream that is just a way of creating a smokescreen to distract from the UK Government#s handling of Brexit and its reckless and partisan approach to the Withdrawal Agreement.For me that#s all about deflection, [Boris Johnson] would be better spending money on giving healthcare staff additional wages, proper wages, she added.One major factor that could sink any fixed link before it even breaks ground is Beaufort#s Dyke, an area of the Irish Sea where surplus munitions from the two World Wars and radioactive waste were dumped.It is thought that in excess of one million tonnes of munitions dumped there by the War Office and its successor the Ministry of Defence up until the mid-s.The UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities campaign group said it would be a real challenge to develop either a bridge or tunnel project between NI and GB.One leading bomb disposal expert said either project would be impractical but not impossible.Former Royal Navy clearance er Michael Fellows told the Belfastearlier this month that a tunnel would be a dodgy operation, considering the volume of munitions on the seabed.Whatever you put in place, be it a tunnel or a bridge, it#s going to need supports, so you#re going to have to be very careful where you place those supports so that you don#t hit something while drilling. You#ll also have to conduct regular surveys to stop any explosions, he added.The idea of a connection between Scotland and Northern Ireland is a brilliant one but you have got to get rid of the explosive problem initially, which is an almost impossible task.Belfast Most ReadEntire terrace of Belfast homes is infested with rats, says councillorNI judges killed by IRA should be beatied by Pope, says ex-Provo bomberBBC#s Stephen Nolan says many of , signing petition to cancel show #anonymous and made-up names#Davy  scandal: The Belfast developer in eye of Republic#s financial stormMy run-in with Piers Morgan was horric, admits Apprentice star Grainne McCoyTop VideosPlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayMichelle O#Neill ‘fell asleep’ during Harry and Meghan interviewLatest Northern IrelandDonaldson backs #terric# Conservative plan to see NI host House of Commons meetingsHughes Insurance moves staff to permanent home working with more jobs and cash paymentNI man admits assaulting two Quinn executives days after father lost job at firmStockbroker Davy to be sold in wake of scandal Latest from Belfast Tyson Fury says Anthony Joshua fight is ‘nowhere near’ being finalisedOld Firm game could be postponedassurances not given, says YousafEFL delivers one million food parcels to support people in needDonaldson backs #terric# Conservative plan to see NI host House of Commons meetingsIran arrests producers in pop music video crackdown,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Chair of the inquiry, Mr Justice O#Hara, was scathing about the fact that some witnesses had to have the truth dragged out of them.He also said that doctors and managers can#t simply be relied upon to do the right thing at the right time and urged them to stop putting their own reputation and interests first. Professor Young became involved in the inquiry as he carried out an independent review of Claire#s treatment following a request by the medical director at the trust at the time, Dr Michael McBride - now Northern Ireland#s chief medical officer.

He also criticised Prof Young#s assertion at the inquest that doctors caring for Claire had followed good clinical practice. While the coroner found hyponatraemia contributed to Claire#s death, he said it was as a result of natural causes rather than fluid mismanagement.Prof Young self-referred to the GMC following the publication of the Hyponatraemia Inquiry report, which initially decided not to proceed with a formal investigation. This decision was challenged by Claire#s father, Alan, and the GMC subsequently reviewed the matter and decided to reverse the original decision.It moved to investigate three allegations - that Prof Young contributed to a letter to Mr and Mrs Roberts which included highly questionable content, that he provided misleading evidence to Claire#s inquest and that he failed to acknowledge failings in care and or provided misleading dishonest information to Mr and Mrs Roberts. Prof Young, who denies all the allegations, launched High Court proceedings to argue that the GMC was wrong to overrule its original decision not to carry out an investigation. Following yesterday#s ruling, the GMC can carry out an investigation to decide whether the matter should be examined by a fitness to practise .Belfast Related ContentPlayNorthern Ireland PremiumFather of Claire Roberts welcomes ruling allowing probe into NI chief scientic adviser’s role in hyponatraemia tragedyThe father of a girl who died from hyponatraemia has welcomed a High Court ruling allowing an investigation into how Northern Ireland’s chief scientic adviser carried out a review into the nine-year-old’s care.Most ReadEntire terrace of Belfast homes is infested with rats, says councillorNI judges killed by IRA should be beatied by Pope, says ex-Provo bomberBBC#s Stephen Nolan says many of , signing petition to cancel show #anonymous and made-up names#Davy  scandal: The Belfast developer in eye of Republic#s financial stormMy run-in with Piers Morgan was horric, admits Apprentice star Grainne McCoyTop VideosPlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayMichelle O#Neill ‘fell asleep’ during Harry and Meghan interviewLatest Northern IrelandDonaldson backs #terric# Conservative plan to see NI host House of Commons meetingsHughes Insurance moves staff to permanent home working with more jobs and cash paymentBoris Bridge: Foster left bemused by critics of proposed Northern Ireland-Scotland connectionNI man admits assaulting two Quinn executives days after father lost job at firmStockbroker Davy to be sold in wake of scandal Latest from Belfast EFL delivers one million food parcels to support people in needDonaldson backs #terric# Conservative plan to see NI host House of Commons meetingsIran arrests producers in pop music video crackdownJamie Conlan confident Lewis Crocker will take step towards British title bidIt#s time we updated our Covid rules, insists Warrenpoint boss Barry Gray,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are also tributes from other friends and family who share their memories of the actor and other people who talk about how they were inspired by his legacy.Adrian said: Jimmy was a great actor, friend and mentor to me. His presence will always be missed. He found himself at the forefront of the theatre after leaving Queen#s University and his work with the Group Theatre and then with playwright Sam Thompson propelled him across the water where he once again found himself at the forefront of a TV revolution in the s promoting his own people.James, who also starred in the Billy plays, in Ballykissangel and Only Fools and Horses, released a record of him singing Johnny Todd, the theme song of Z Cars.Adrian and fellow Northern Ireland man James Nesbitt were among a large number of theatre and TV actors who attended James Ellis#s funeral in an east Belfast church before he was buried in a churchyard at Castlereagh.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAdrian DunbarPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAdrian DunbarFour years ago the James Ellis Bridge was named in his honour on the Connswater Community Greenway close to his family home in Park Avenue and it is on their social media site that the video will be posted next week.On Friday, March  there will be an online celebration of James#s le via Zoom.The organisers EastSide Greenways said: The evening will also reveal for the first time the unpublished and surprising written talents of James Ellis.Michele Bryans from the Eastside Greenways said James Ellis was an actor, director, writer and trailblazer who inspired many people.James# widow Robina said: The Ellis family are very grateful for this th birthday celebrations and we also fondly remember the fourth anniversary of the opening of the James Ellis bridge.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In Box of Butterlies, Roma, best known as the angel on the television showTouched by an Angel, shares stories from her le, alongside quotes, poems, scripture and artwork that she believes will uplt the reader as they have her. Flled with encouragement and hope, each chapter of the full-colour book covers topics such as courage, strength, gratitude, love, and kindness. Ever since she was a little girl, the former Thornhill College pupil says she has seen butterflies as a reminder of God’s presence. googletag.cmd.push They have appeared to her in moments when she needed encouragement and reminded her she is not alone. She said that reminiscent of the message of Touched by an Angel, the book’s central theme is that there is a God. “He loves you, and that even in your most dficult moments, He is by your side. That though you may feel alone, you are never truly alone. “The subtle butterfly theme reminds us that the wonder of God’s love and kindness is sometimes reflected in the gentle whispers of his creation and that we all have the power to transform from simple caterpillars into exquisite butterflies.” googletag.cmd.push The Foyle Hospice, of which Roma is patron, has signed copies of book for sale at a price of just pound. The normal retail price is pound. The hospice said the book would make a great present for Mothers Day. Copies of the signed book can be ordered through the Foyle Hospice website.       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Liam Tunney: Why did you get into politics  Aaron Callan: My family has always been a family of service. My grandfather served for  years in the fire service and Ive had cousins and family members whove served in the RUC and the army. I was never going to join the army or anything like that, so the best way I could give service was through politics and giving back to the community. Im very proud to be from Limavady, very passionate about the area and I like to be part of the solutions and bringing some good to the area googletag.cmd.push  LT: What would you say has been your best achievement on the council  AC: One of the things Im very passionate about is our local area, and seeing the play park come to fruition. Internally on the council, things that maybe arent as important to constituents, making the running of the council better has been pleasing. For example, I pushed for a Finance Committee to be set up and I think its helped to make the business of the council more productive.  LT: What has you biggest challenge been  AC: You had four dferent council areas coming into one and developing those relationships, not only within your own party, but with other colleagues across the Borough has been challenging at times. googletag.cmd.push Everybody is fighting for their own area, and its making sure we get an outcome for the council as a whole.  LT: Youve touched on co-operation there. The council has a reputation for a lack of co-operation. How can that be improved  AC: People have their own viewpoints and discussion points, but we agree on bringing further investment, more jobs and prosperity to the area. It goes back to building relationships and making sure you can maintain them. Sometimes they are a bit fraught. Its about making sure, when we come to those decision points, we can do it in a manageable way. I miss being in the chamber and being able to have a chat with my own colleagues and other parties.      LT: Politics and people are constantly evolving. You started with the UUP. Could you tell me why you started with the UUP and then why you moved to the DUP  AC: My family were always Ulster Unionist. My great-great grandfather ran for council for the UUP in Bellarena during the s. The reason I changed over was because I felt the UUP was no longer favourable for unionism. The DUP was the leading voice and I also felt unionism needed to be working together more and felt I had to show myself that I could work for other unionists. Cllr Callan with former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt. The Limavady councillor began political le in the UUP. LT: You were a major driver in the Portrush Air Show plans that came to council last month. Many of your constituents in Limavady might ask whats in it for me  Could you tell them  AC: The air show brings eyes to the area and means people will come and visit. It opens up the door for people to see other parts of the area. Having big events like the air show, showcases our area in a good way and it means that people who come to the air show might think they want to visit Limavady.  LT: One of the main reasons for objection is the link to the Queens Jubilee. Does the opposition frustrate you  AC: The Queen is one of the most respected people in the world. When she turned  she visited the area. At the time the mayor was nationalist and welcomed the Queen with open arms. You dont have to be a royalist to be part of this or celebrate what the Royal family stands for, but it would be a way of tying into a larger, signicant national event. Its frustrating that people cant see the positives. I think we can create events we all can share in, but sometimes it comes down to trying to create an orange and green situation.  LT: You have a big interest in local history. How has that shaped you and your politics  AC: British and Irish history is full of ironies and paradoxes. When the Act of Union came about, the Orange Order, now seen as a firm supporter of the Union, was originally opposed to it. Reading through old newspaper records, issues that have come up in council in recent years are issues that have come up in council  or  years ago. We have a very short-term institutional memory. Were focused on the here and now and sometimes its good to have that longer perspective.  LT: Council set the rate last week at .%. Since then Mid Ulster have set a % rate. The outworking is that Kilreas rates went up, but just down the road in Maghera they were frozen. Do you still feel the rate set is appropriate  AC: Yeah. Over the letime of our council, we have set the second lowest rates in Northern Ireland. We have been as prudent as we can. We are a very lean council, but there are other factors at play as well. We want to maintain services that all the community rely on and that are vital to what the community does, especially coming out the other end of Covid-. If we had gone any lower it was going to impact on what we do as a council and what services we provide.  LT: Finally, have you any goals you want to achieve in the rest of the council term  AC: There is a never-ending list of things wed like to see done, but the Limavady play park is one I know all councillors in Limavady have been developing for the best part of four years. I think that Roe Mill Playing Area can be developed into a real hub of activity for the local community, whether you want to play football, go to the park or just do a walk.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The red glow of tail lights shepherds motorists down Coleraine Road to the traffic lights, the sound of their engines reverberating off the closed shutters of Walshs Hotel. A khaki-clad mannequin stares ominously from the window of Crawford Field Sports, a silent sentry keeping watch on the crossroads. Through the filter of early Spring, youd be forgiven for thinking normality had ed. The sight of a woman rushing across the road, face visor steaming up with the effort, shatters the mirage. googletag.cmd.push Frustrated faces peer from stationary vehicles on Main Street. Childrens voices carry down Station Road, in contrast to the eerie quiet of the Lurach Centre play park. Crows cackle in the trees above the Walled Garden and the smell of freshly slurried fields attacks the senses on the way through. The Largantogher Walkway cuts through the town. Through the dense trees lies the disputed Maghera High School site, ground zero in a long-running battle between the council and a local environmental group over its new purpose. Planning permission for an industrial park has been granted, but Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is set to have the final say. googletag.cmd.push Asto underline the point, a council van sits outside the gate. Keep Out notices are festooned along theof the fence. On the corner, two metal slats have been prised off for access. On the way back up the Tobermore Road, two children come down on their bikes, their mum running alongside them. A treat on the final day of homeschooling, perhaps. Back on Main Street, tattered Slaughtneil flags hang outside the Dugout Bar, clinging on in defiance as it continues to wait for a reopening commitment. Two men in caps are chatting outside Kellys Eurospar. A woman opens the door of the pharmacy across the road and calls out. She wants to knowhes going in for the paper.     “Ive no money on me,” comes the reply. The chapel and Fairhill Youth Centre are deserted, but at Crawfordsburn four children move in tandem on the swings. Two teenage girls walk down Glenview, eating from a bag of chips. Its a case of small mercies for the young amid the pandemic. An empty playground at Crawfordsburn. Children have been hit hard by the pandemic. A mounted sign at the entrance to Crawfordsburn Drive urges Solidarity with Palestine. Across the road, a more understated sign from Watty Grahams GAC urges people to take home their rubbish. On the way back in the road, the play park is once again deserted. Neither young nor old are hanging around too long these days. At the corner of Fairhill, McKennas Bar is operating their off licence, and doing a brisk Friday afternoon trade. A table cordoning off the entrance and a screen that drops down from the ceiling bring a sobering reality to the scene. Caitliacuten McKenna is actually reading the Derry Post as I arrive and says it might be the first time shes given us her real name. Shes referring to the Out and About pictures, smiling revellers appeasing the photographer for a two-page spread that is sadly no longer a possibility. For now. Caitliacuten, Caoimhe, and owner Sean McKenna, are all pining for those better days. “Last summer was good craic out in the beer garden,” says Caitliacuten. “Wed always had that space but we revamped it a good bit to make more use of it. Even people who knew it was there were surprised at how big it was when it was overhauled. “Its not too hard to get your , steps a day carrying pints out there.” “Its been a big change, serving people through the hatch and not letting anybody in. Youd have been used to people around the bar a lot of the time,” adds Sean. Sean, Caoimhe and Caitliacuten McKenna hard at work in McKennas Bar. “This is a social hub, youd have had people in and out all the time, whereas out there, though they may be some of the same people from the bar, theyre only staying for a minute and away they go again. “Another change is Im sitting at home on a Friday or Saturday night from  oclock thinking I should be doing something.” The flow of customers interrupts our chat. People finishing up work for the weekend, some calling in on a whim, others a more regular sight. Caoimhe tells me it has been hard on those regulars for whom the pub is very much an arena for conversation. “You do get some who will stand and have a wee chat, because its maybe their only social interaction,” she says. “Its been a while since theyve seen some people, so you get a wee bit of gossip out there that you miss out on having the bar closed. “Then when it gets to  oclock, its mad out there, just before closing. Everybody ends up having a chat with each other at the hatch. “Theyre more likely to meet someone they know then. You also get a lot of people waving in while they are out for their exercise as well.”  We mention the general dferences between the current period of restrictions and the previous lockdowns, but its interesting to view them through the lens of the pub owners. “People arent buying as much drink as they were the first time round,” says Caoimhe. “The weather isnt the same and people cant sit outside in their gardens at the minute. It was a novelty, and people were almost treating it like a holiday. “The town is busier than last time round. It was really, really quiet before, but there is definitely more traffic and more people about than the previous lockdown. “We have noticed a wee bit of a change with a lot more people buying craft beer that they might have had access tothey were out in bars further afield – Belfast or Derry maybe. “A lot of people were making cocktails the first time down. People were asking for all sorts of things at the start that wed never had before because they were making cocktails.” On the way out, Sean draws my attention to the crystal Kalashnikov hanging above the off licence tills. From Russia with love. Covid-, a less welcome import from the East, has brought down a muffled filter on the streets of our towns and villages. Conversation is terse, interaction limited. Hope might spring eternal but you cant gulp on it forever. Magheras Covid rate fell into double figures last week, and despite a slight increase this week, expectant eyes turn towards the decisions of the NI Executive. Heading home on the Coleraine Road, the site of the old police station is busy with construction, the new leisure facilities moving closer to completion. Maghera is poised and ready when normality gets the green light.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The red glow of tail lights shepherds motorists down Coleraine Road to the traffic lights, the sound of their engines reverberating off the closed shutters of Walshs Hotel. A khaki-clad mannequin stares ominously from the window of Crawford Field Sports, a silent sentry keeping watch on the crossroads. Through the filter of early Spring, youd be forgiven for thinking normality had ed. The sight of a woman rushing across the road, face visor steaming up with the effort, shatters the mirage. googletag.cmd.push Frustrated faces peer from stationary vehicles on Main Street. Childrens voices carry down Station Road, in contrast to the eerie quiet of the Lurach Centre play park. Crows cackle in the trees above the Walled Garden and the smell of freshly slurried fields attacks the senses on the way through. The Largantogher Walkway cuts through the town. Through the dense trees lies the disputed Maghera High School site, ground zero in a long-running battle between the council and a local environmental group over its new purpose. Planning permission for an industrial park has been granted, but Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is set to have the final say. googletag.cmd.push Asto underline the point, a council van sits outside the gate. Keep Out notices are festooned along theof the fence. On the corner, two metal slats have been prised off for access. On the way back up the Tobermore Road, two children come down on their bikes, their mum running alongside them. A treat on the final day of homeschooling, perhaps. Back on Main Street, tattered Slaughtneil flags hang outside the Dugout Bar, clinging on in defiance as it continues to wait for a reopening commitment. Two men in caps are chatting outside Kellys Eurospar. A woman opens the door of the pharmacy across the road and calls out. She wants to knowhes going in for the paper.     “Ive no money on me,” comes the reply. The chapel and Fairhill Youth Centre are deserted, but at Crawfordsburn four children move in tandem on the swings. Two teenage girls walk down Glenview, eating from a bag of chips. Its a case of small mercies for the young amid the pandemic. An empty playground at Crawfordsburn. Children have been hit hard by the pandemic. A mounted sign at the entrance to Crawfordsburn Drive urges Solidarity with Palestine. Across the road, a more understated sign from Watty Grahams GAC urges people to take home their rubbish. On the way back in the road, the play park is once again deserted. Neither young nor old are hanging around too long these days. At the corner of Fairhill, McKennas Bar is operating their off licence, and doing a brisk Friday afternoon trade. A table cordoning off the entrance and a screen that drops down from the ceiling bring a sobering reality to the scene. Caitliacuten McKenna is actually reading the Derry Post as I arrive and says it might be the first time shes given us her real name. Shes referring to the Out and About pictures, smiling revellers appeasing the photographer for a two-page spread that is sadly no longer a possibility. For now. Caitliacuten, Caoimhe, and owner Sean McKenna, are all pining for those better days. “Last summer was good craic out in the beer garden,” says Caitliacuten. “Wed always had that space but we revamped it a good bit to make more use of it. Even people who knew it was there were surprised at how big it was when it was overhauled. “Its not too hard to get your , steps a day carrying pints out there.” “Its been a big change, serving people through the hatch and not letting anybody in. Youd have been used to people around the bar a lot of the time,” adds Sean. Sean, Caoimhe and Caitliacuten McKenna hard at work in McKennas Bar. “This is a social hub, youd have had people in and out all the time, whereas out there, though they may be some of the same people from the bar, theyre only staying for a minute and away they go again. “Another change is Im sitting at home on a Friday or Saturday night from  oclock thinking I should be doing something.” The flow of customers interrupts our chat. People finishing up work for the weekend, some calling in on a whim, others a more regular sight. Caoimhe tells me it has been hard on those regulars for whom the pub is very much an arena for conversation. “You do get some who will stand and have a wee chat, because its maybe their only social interaction,” she says. “Its been a while since theyve seen some people, so you get a wee bit of gossip out there that you miss out on having the bar closed. “Then when it gets to  oclock, its mad out there, just before closing. Everybody ends up having a chat with each other at the hatch. “Theyre more likely to meet someone they know then. You also get a lot of people waving in while they are out for their exercise as well.”  We mention the general dferences between the current period of restrictions and the previous lockdowns, but its interesting to view them through the lens of the pub owners. “People arent buying as much drink as they were the first time round,” says Caoimhe. “The weather isnt the same and people cant sit outside in their gardens at the minute. It was a novelty, and people were almost treating it like a holiday. “The town is busier than last time round. It was really, really quiet before, but there is definitely more traffic and more people about than the previous lockdown. “We have noticed a wee bit of a change with a lot more people buying craft beer that they might have had access tothey were out in bars further afield – Belfast or Derry maybe. “A lot of people were making cocktails the first time down. People were asking for all sorts of things at the start that wed never had before because they were making cocktails.” On the way out, Sean draws my attention to the crystal Kalashnikov hanging above the off licence tills. From Russia with love. Covid-, a less welcome import from the East, has brought down a muffled filter on the streets of our towns and villages. Conversation is terse, interaction limited. Hope might spring eternal but you cant gulp on it forever. Magheras Covid rate fell into double figures last week, and despite a slight increase this week, expectant eyes turn towards the decisions of the NI Executive. Heading home on the Coleraine Road, the site of the old police station is busy with construction, the new leisure facilities moving closer to completion. Maghera is poised and ready when normality gets the green light.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its a brilliant opportunity to showcase those who have gone before. One thing you notice is the pleasure people get from chatting about the past. Everyone has a story to tell. And in a way, it is a therapy for the sporting landscape they crave. In recent weeks Danny Quinn lted the lid on Derrys progression through the eighties. At a glance, it was a mixture of a competitive club scene and school conveyor belts feeding a minor and U group that took Ulster and beyond by story. Danny puts the current Derry football landscape alongside the one he toiled in. And everything comes in cycles. googletag.cmd.push I agree wholeheartedly. Things are starting to pick up again. Since Derry minors chinned All-Ireland favourites Donegal in a  Clones ambush on the way to a first Ulster title in  years, the Oakleaf has been rising. The digger man is long since gone. The foundations have been poured, the first floor joists have been laid and the brickies are shaping the house towards wall-plate height in project Derry. In an aside, Damian Cassidys new football development committee have peeked into Kerry and Dublin, to see what it takes to turn one house into a new development. They have jotted down their findings, dotted their is and crossed their ts. The planning permission has been applied for. Its a waiting game now to see how much their proposed development can grow. googletag.cmd.push For now, Rory Gallagher is finding a way to get Derrys current side to roof height and beyond. Its often said that defeats are analysed more than wins. There always needs to be a reason for loss. Rory will no doubt have picked through the rubble of their championship defeat last year. The manner in which Donegal pulverised Armagh would suggest that a first Ulster title since  was beyond Derry. But one thing is for certain, victory that night in Celtic Park was well within their grasp. Chrissy McKaigue suggested it as much before the game. Theyd certainly be competitive, he assured me, as I briefly wished him good luck a few hours before the game.     Defensively,theyd have got anything out of the first  minutes, theyd have won a first Ulster championship game since . They were carved open too easy for the first four points. Possession was coughed up and when play ed to Derrys defence, there wasnt a hand put on Rory Grugan , Jamie Clarke or Jarlath Oacuteg Burns as they kicked Geezers charges into a grip of a game they never lost. Trailing by six at the break, Derry were a dferent animal in the second half and had more about them. Had they not been as wasteful during Armaghs  minutes without the black-carded Jamie Clarke, it was another reason why theyd have won. In time, Derry have the tools to build a team to oxter their way into the top table in Ulster. Like Cavan did, to lever themselves inside Donegal and Tyrone at the head of the queue. For now,we are going to break the mould and take a championship performance to a level where we are putting tiles on the roof, a medium to long kick-out strategy needs to be added to the locker. Of Odhraacuten Lynchs  kick-outs on his championship debut against Armagh,  of them found a red and white jersey. All but two of those won were uncontested and mainly in the defensive parish, eight of them by Padraig McGrogan who peeled into space. It is possession, but it only takes you so far. At the other end, when Derry had the full press on and were gnawing away at Armaghs lead, Blaine Hughes kicked over the top of midfield. It hurt Derrys defence. Three of the kick-outs in particular were won by impact substitute Niall Grimley. It was enough to stem the tide. Odhraacuten Lynchs legs are like rocket launchers. Roll back the years to the  MacRory semi-final over Maghera when he thumped the ball well into their defence. The previous year, when Bessbrook looked like they were taking the semi-final replay to extra-time, Lynch had other ideas. No sooner had the umpires white flag signalled Liam Kerrs equaliser, the Convent netminder grabbed a second ball from behind the goals and arrowed his kick-out down the wing to Conal Devlin. It was instinctive and in the white heat of championship. And seconds later Kevin Smalls winner had Magherafelt into the final. The conundrum for Gallagher is an absence of natural midfielders. Those who will pluck a ball when needed. Conor Glass is only back in the country five minutes and Oisin McWilliams has a paltry  minutes inter-county experience behind him. Aside from Emmett Bradley, thats Derrys out and out midfield options. Niall Holly is not on the  and the rest of the midfielders in the county are mobile runners. The Padraig Cassidys, Ciaran McFauls and the Danny Heavrons. Players who mainly operate there at club level because of their engines rather than a leap to pluck kick-outs. At club level, Lynch, Slaughtneils Antoacutein McMullan and new Glen keeper Connlan Bradleys games all revolve around using the spaces to find these men. Its effective. But, at county level, Derry need to find a couple of longer options. One could be an overload of players on a given wing, something built around a set of signals. For example, plonk Conor Glass on one flank, with breaking ball scavengers within running distance. A tactic could be a low trajectory kick in Glass direction and the area is flooded to create an overload. It wouldnt work every time, but it only needs to come into the game to offer iation. A second option would be the kick to the outside, something Steelstown used to perfection. A line of men down the middle and once goalkeeper Marty Dunne began his run, blue jersies peeled left and right to give him options. Like Conal Devlin did for Lynch in that aforementioned MacRory game. Another example was Michael McEvoys selfless decoy runs, from wing to wing, in the  league final against Leitrim in Croke Park. He rarely handled the ball, but it opened so many doors for others and Thomas Mallons kicking into the spaces was a joy to watch. Kick-outs dictate so much of what direction a game takes. The kicking tees helped coaches find a way of convincing slender U keepers to stay between the posts a year later when faced with kicking a bigger ball, the size five, off the ground. With Stephen Cluxtons high standards, now the number one jersey is an attractive option for young players. Goalkeeping is now cool, but it is only as successful as the tactics further out the field and runs made. Rory Gallagher has found a goalkeeper with an age profile that can helphim grow into a long-term option for Derry. If a short-term success story is found to the countys terrible Ulster championship record, safe possessions in defence must be replaced with winning the ball further up the field to hurt teams and keep them guessing. Only then, will the ridge tiles find themselves on the roof. Rome wasnt built in a day. Neither was a house.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chivers, the current Club Chairman, was an advocate of kicking the ball. He would later train the All-Ireland winning team he helped build. The relentless kicking drills instilled the message that led to their first All-Ireland final goal. Johnny McGurks high ball created panic in the Salthill defence. Alan Mulholland made a catch, but then he tried to play himself out of danger, Seamus Downeys tackle led to Don Mulholland finding the net. Spirit and kicking in the same sentence, on the biggest of days. “Sometimes we gave it away, but we were a smaller team and the quicker we moved the ball the better,” McGurk adds. “If the full forward line was out in front you kicked it andthey werent, you took another hand to toe. You didnt hold the ball unless you had to.” Hugh Martin McGurk, at , was the oldest player on the starting team. But it took a brave decision at the start of the  season to set them on their way. A defeat to Dungiven in , McGurk felt, was a watershed moment. When John Brennan came in as manager the following year he had a decision to make. Back youth, or go for what had been before. “John had a big part to play in our overall determination and our healthy attitude for winning, he put that into us,” McGurk added. “John came in and bred a pile of young ones from those minor teams. At the risk of being caught out badly, he had the faith in us and it was a big thing.” It paid off when they saw off Newbridge and  years after watching Hurley lt the cup, McGurk looked on as Henry Downey did likewise and he could reach out and touch the championship medal he craved. *** By the start of the  season Brendan Convery took over as senior manager, with Paddy Chivers on board and Laveys dream season was about to get off the ground. Also part of the management team was Paddy Dillon and Brendan Henry, who mixed secretary duties with his magic sponge. “Nerowasnt a man for coaching and ball drills,” Johnny points out. “He wouldve watched training and picked up things about players, it helped him to make changes at important times. “He didnt get too annoyed at any stage. He had the character of a golfer, which he was, so he was relaxed and just watched.” Laveys road to glory began with a very testing game with Castledawson. After a convincing win over Ballerin, it set up a semi-final clash with Dungiven, a rivalry that seemed to pen a new chapter every year between football and hurling. “They were a serious outfit,” McGurk said. “Theyd players with county titles and plenty who had represented the county over the years at all levels. “It was always dog eat dog until itwas over but there was a healthy respect. Lavey and Dungiven wouldve always have got on off the pitch, wouldve sat and had a pint with each other.” After a tight opening spell, Brian McCormicks long kick from defence, won by Seamus Downey, led to Collie McGurks goal and Lavey went on to control the game. With Paddy McGurk and Liam McElhinney clawing for a loose ball, it ended up in the Lavey net to give Dungiven a leline. When Eunan OKane later levelled matters, it took points from McCormick and Johnny McGurk to put Lavey into the county final. After shipping an early Sean D ONeill goal in the final, a similar fisted effort to the Screen net by Seamus Downey had Lavey back in the game. In the final quarter, McCormicks goal opened up a six-point lead before Hugh Martin McGurk netted a third to put the result beyond doubt. “There was never a moment when we felt wed have a chance of winning an All-Ireland,” McGurk replied. “Most teams, they think about the next game and its one less and you just keep going... you think two games ahead, youre gone.” Donegal champions Naomh Columba were waiting in the first round of Ulster in Ballybofey, a team that included county stars John Joe Doherty, Paddy and Noel Hegarty. Two Felix Convery points saw Lavey emerge from a tough encounter. As the players mingled with supporters after the meal back in Jacksons Hotel, there was a sense that something special was brewing. To help create a matchday atmosphere, the team travelled by bus for the rest of the season, even their home semi-final with Armaghs Sarsfields in Ballinascreen. “There was a routine for the last  or  minutes before coming out and wed always have Sean South of Garryowen belting out in the bus as we arrived at the pitch,” McGurk remembers. It was a tempestuous game and another one of inches. In the dying moments, Brian McCormicks scrappy goal, greeted by Collie McGurks somersault to celebrate amid a deafening din of air horns, told Lavey they were in an Ulster club final. The final against Kingscourt was a walk in the park. Despite having Cavan county players Jim Reilly, Pat and Michael Faulkner, Lavey cut through them and won by  points. The party was in full flow when word filtered through out of the blue of their pending All-Ireland Quarter-Final with a star-studded Tir Chonaill Gaels, who boasted Mattie McGleenan and James McCartan in their ranks. “We thought we had the Christmas break and well have a few pints all week,” McGurk remembers of their celebrations eventually put on the back burner. A lack of preparation or knowledge of their London opponents left it another sticky game. It wasnt helped with the wintry weather leaving the game in doubt less than -hours before. “They gave us a fright,” McGurk said, of Laveys three-point deficit as the final minutes ticked away. James Chivers won a throw-in in front of the stand before feeding Seamus Downey, who kicked the ball forward. Their coaching drills always had them finding the man in space. This was dferent. It was the pressure cooker. All shape went out the window. It was all hands to the pump. In the end it was the old dog for the hard road. When corner-back Damien Dohertys low shot came back off the butt of the post,  year-old Anthony McGurk slam dunked the rebound to the net to level the game and Lavey won after extra-time. It was David versus Goliath in the All-Ireland semi-final at Celtic Park against Dublin giants Thomas Davis, who had Dublin players Paul Curran and Dave Foran in their side. Lavey had prepared a scouting trip to watch them in the Leinster final that turned into a bonding day in a Kildare hostelry. The fog had descended by the time the bus, with both players and supporters, arrived in Newbridge and the game was postponed. It took two goals to get Lavey over the line against Thomas Davis, with James Chivers having a hand in both. His fist past teased the Dublin keeper off his line, but the incoming Don Mulholland, who was second favourite to get to the ball, had no reverse gear. He got a hand to the ball, and seconds later Seamus Downey slammed to the net. In the second half, Chivers high ball forward saw Hugh Martin McGurk fouled. He took the kick himself and when it somehow squirmed to the net, Lavey had one foot in Croke Park. They still had to breathe a sigh of relief when a late Thomas Davis snapshot, the last kick of the game, flashed across goal “Theyclapped us off at the end of the game and that was a very fitting thing to do,” McGurk remembers. Teenager Brian McCormick kicked - as Lavey finished the job against Salthill to seal their All-Ireland. It was the final step in an enthralling journey. The outpouring of emotion befitted the endless hours of toil and development to reach the pinnacle. It was a victory for community and channelling everything into putting themselves on the map. Johnny McGurk raises the Andy Merrigan Cup at Croke ParkLater in the year, the Derry championships competitive edge was again evident when Dungiven knocked them off their perch, taking all three titles in one swoop in another tense encounter at Glen. Lavey won Ulster again in  before retaining their title the following year, the last time John McLaughlin paid a visit. There is always the regret of missing a second All-Ireland. After having two men sent off, they left themselves too much to do against Skibbereen, who went the whole way. McGurk feels the sendings off were harsh. “I think wed have won it had we got over them,” he laments. “People say we got lucky the year we won the All-Ireland, but there were other years when we were unlucky not to have won a county title. It was hard to win the Derry championship and like most Derry sides, wed have been competitivewed got into Ulster.” When the parish of Lavey wakes up next Wednesday, the first thing theyll remember will be that magical day,  years ago, when a wave of emotion, on the back of years of toil, carried the Andy Merrigan Cup into their lives.\",\"keywords\":\"Lavey,,Johnny McGurk,All-Ireland Champions,Derry\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Thirty years ago Lavey were crowned All-Ireland club champions.

Captain Johnny McGurk looks back on a year of memories and what made their journey special. Michael McMullan tells the story...Spirit. Johnny McGurk may be scanning back  years, but his answer is instant. What immediately comes to mind when he reflects on  and Laveys -game march to dreamland  Those two syllables say it all for the skipper. The Andy Merrigan Cup in McGurks grasp is like the parish he represented on that magical March Sunday. Small in appearance, but massive in every other way. Joxer was just  years of age when Niall Hurley held aloft the John McLaughlin Cup to end a -year Derry championship famine in . Hed always dreamt of winning a championship. “I remember standing behind the goals with a pile of other wains,” McGurk said of that afternoon in Magherafelt when Paddy Chivers pass set up Joe Boyles clinching goal in a - to - win over Ballinderry. googletag.cmd.push Standing in the Hogan Stand, on St Patricks Day , the clubs greatest day, the entire parish congregated below him, awash with orange and black. They emit pride and joy in equal measure. For McGurk, every man, woman and child represented the players the same as the players did for them. It was a two way street. Right down to Parish Priest Fr ODonnells fanatic support of the team. “After games, you werent as much a player, you were just part of the whole setup,” McGurk outlines. “Everybody was in the middle of it and nobody got any special treatment. There was a wave and everybody was on it...thank God it kept going. The spirit and atmosphere in the parish is something that always sticks with me.” googletag.cmd.push The Lavey team and some of their young supporters after the  Derry county final Lavey needed every ounce of their resilience in a season littered with turning points. On the face of it, their Derry, Ulster and All-Ireland finals offered the most daylight on the scoreboard. “Its easy to say that after a final,” McGurk says in disagreement. He digs deeper. Finals were there to be won. Moments from Laveys five-point win All-Ireland final win over Salthill were tense enough. It took a fullsave from Brendan Regan to prevent Mark Butler a certain goal that wouldve levelled the game in the second half. The same player denied Collie McGurk, Don Mulholland and the Downey brothers Hogan Cup glory with a late winning point seven years earlier.     “I dont relax in games, the only time I enjoyed was after them,” Johnny admits. Growing up, to win a Derry championship wouldve been a focus. Winning the top prize was never in his wildest dreams. “To come home with the cup on the Sunday night after the All-Ireland final was one of the most special moments youd ever have in your le.” After stepping off the bus, the kit-bags were stowed away in the dressing room before they paraded into the packed hall. On the stage behind them was a series of stars, each with their name. Goosebumps stuff. “It was a packed house for most of the nights that year,” McGurk recalls. “Population wise, we hadnt the greatest of numbers, but whoever was in any way attached to Lavey was there.” Last autumn, his sons Patrick and James retained their minor championship title on a team playing a ied brand of football. Johnny and Seamus Downey coached the team that includes their sons. The new crop are beacons for the future. Like all the clubs teams, the black star on the back of their jersies is the imprint of , when Lavey stood tallest. *** A November birthday isnt an underage players best friend. Especially one as slight as Johnny McGurk. Derrys U leagues didnt begin until he was overage. After primary school, there was nothing until U. Coming from a family of  and one of eight boys, sport was never far away. Their mother Catherine Bradley came from a family steeped in music and dance in Tobermore, while also lining out for Desertmartin camogs. “To throw a ball or a hurling stick out in the evening was as big a rest for my father and mother as anything,” Johnny said. Sadly, their father Hugh A tragically died after taking ill while watching his sons in championship action for Lavey against Newbridge on at Greenlough in . Growing up, he had high standards. Three things werent accepted, as Johnny outlines pulling out of a ball, not putting in the necessary effort and needlessly lying down. As a  year-old, Johnny shipped a decent tackle on a wet night against Banagher. A voice from outside the pitch, told him, in no uncertain terms, to get back on his feet. It was his father. “I got up brave and sharp, I can tell you,” Johnny laughs. “Hed let you know, but he was your biggest fan at the same time.” Packed into the car, with more bums than seats, to watch his older brother Anthony play for Derry in far flung corners of Ireland ignited a desire to play at the highest level. GAA was always top of the menu, but the local soccer games between Lower and Upper Gulladuff sharpened the competitive edge, the sort that end at dark or a call for dinner. “We were known as Upper Gulladuff. There werent too many of us and there were plenty of them, but that was kicking lumps out of each other every evening,” Johnny remembers. “There was a competitiveness about it which stood to us in later years.” At U level, Lavey were on the wrong side of a few hidings and the dream of winning a championship medal was light years away. Glenullins talented teams were ahead of them. They couldnt compete with the numbers Glen, Bellaghy and Dungiven had, while Kilrea also dished out hammerings. “We were well down the pecking order coming up,” was Johnnys take on the early years. Persistence was an important ingredient in the process. An U title arrived, followed by back to back minor titles in  and . It would form the backbone of a senior team on the cusp of making the breakthrough. “Paddy Chivers wouldve been instrumental in the younger years and the Doctook us as well, he was a great influence,” Johnny points out. Chivers, the current Club Chairman, was an advocate of kicking the ball. He would later train the All-Ireland winning team he helped build. The relentless kicking drills instilled the message that led to their first All-Ireland final goal. Johnny McGurks high ball created panic in the Salthill defence. Alan Mulholland made a catch, but then he tried to play himself out of danger, Seamus Downeys tackle led to Don Mulholland finding the net. Spirit and kicking in the same sentence, on the biggest of days. “Sometimes we gave it away, but we were a smaller team and the quicker we moved the ball the better,” McGurk adds. “If the full forward line was out in front you kicked it andthey werent, you took another hand to toe. You didnt hold the ball unless you had to.” Hugh Martin McGurk, at , was the oldest player on the starting team. But it took a brave decision at the start of the  season to set them on their way. A defeat to Dungiven in , McGurk felt, was a watershed moment. When John Brennan came in as manager the following year he had a decision to make. Back youth, or go for what had been before. “John had a big part to play in our overall determination and our healthy attitude for winning, he put that into us,” McGurk added. “John came in and bred a pile of young ones from those minor teams. At the risk of being caught out badly, he had the faith in us and it was a big thing.” It paid off when they saw off Newbridge and  years after watching Hurley lt the cup, McGurk looked on as Henry Downey did likewise and he could reach out and touch the championship medal he craved. *** By the start of the  season Brendan Convery took over as senior manager, with Paddy Chivers on board and Laveys dream season was about to get off the ground. Also part of the management team was Paddy Dillon and Brendan Henry, who mixed secretary duties with his magic sponge. “Nerowasnt a man for coaching and ball drills,” Johnny points out. “He wouldve watched training and picked up things about players, it helped him to make changes at important times. “He didnt get too annoyed at any stage. He had the character of a golfer, which he was, so he was relaxed and just watched.” Laveys road to glory began with a very testing game with Castledawson. After a convincing win over Ballerin, it set up a semi-final clash with Dungiven, a rivalry that seemed to pen a new chapter every year between football and hurling. “They were a serious outfit,” McGurk said. “Theyd players with county titles and plenty who had represented the county over the years at all levels. “It was always dog eat dog until itwas over but there was a healthy respect. Lavey and Dungiven wouldve always have got on off the pitch, wouldve sat and had a pint with each other.” After a tight opening spell, Brian McCormicks long kick from defence, won by Seamus Downey, led to Collie McGurks goal and Lavey went on to control the game. With Paddy McGurk and Liam McElhinney clawing for a loose ball, it ended up in the Lavey net to give Dungiven a leline. When Eunan OKane later levelled matters, it took points from McCormick and Johnny McGurk to put Lavey into the county final. After shipping an early Sean D ONeill goal in the final, a similar fisted effort to the Screen net by Seamus Downey had Lavey back in the game. In the final quarter, McCormicks goal opened up a six-point lead before Hugh Martin McGurk netted a third to put the result beyond doubt. “There was never a moment when we felt wed have a chance of winning an All-Ireland,” McGurk replied. “Most teams, they think about the next game and its one less and you just keep going... you think two games ahead, youre gone.” Donegal champions Naomh Columba were waiting in the first round of Ulster in Ballybofey, a team that included county stars John Joe Doherty, Paddy and Noel Hegarty. Two Felix Convery points saw Lavey emerge from a tough encounter. As the players mingled with supporters after the meal back in Jacksons Hotel, there was a sense that something special was brewing. To help create a matchday atmosphere, the team travelled by bus for the rest of the season, even their home semi-final with Armaghs Sarsfields in Ballinascreen. “There was a routine for the last  or  minutes before coming out and wed always have Sean South of Garryowen belting out in the bus as we arrived at the pitch,” McGurk remembers. It was a tempestuous game and another one of inches. In the dying moments, Brian McCormicks scrappy goal, greeted by Collie McGurks somersault to celebrate amid a deafening din of air horns, told Lavey they were in an Ulster club final. The final against Kingscourt was a walk in the park. Despite having Cavan county players Jim Reilly, Pat and Michael Faulkner, Lavey cut through them and won by  points. The party was in full flow when word filtered through out of the blue of their pending All-Ireland Quarter-Final with a star-studded Tir Chonaill Gaels, who boasted Mattie McGleenan and James McCartan in their ranks. “We thought we had the Christmas break and well have a few pints all week,” McGurk remembers of their celebrations eventually put on the back burner. A lack of preparation or knowledge of their London opponents left it another sticky game. It wasnt helped with the wintry weather leaving the game in doubt less than -hours before. “They gave us a fright,” McGurk said, of Laveys three-point deficit as the final minutes ticked away. James Chivers won a throw-in in front of the stand before feeding Seamus Downey, who kicked the ball forward. Their coaching drills always had them finding the man in space. This was dferent. It was the pressure cooker. All shape went out the window. It was all hands to the pump. In the end it was the old dog for the hard road. When corner-back Damien Dohertys low shot came back off the butt of the post,  year-old Anthony McGurk slam dunked the rebound to the net to level the game and Lavey won after extra-time. It was David versus Goliath in the All-Ireland semi-final at Celtic Park against Dublin giants Thomas Davis, who had Dublin players Paul Curran and Dave Foran in their side. Lavey had prepared a scouting trip to watch them in the Leinster final that turned into a bonding day in a Kildare hostelry. The fog had descended by the time the bus, with both players and supporters, arrived in Newbridge and the game was postponed. It took two goals to get Lavey over the line against Thomas Davis, with James Chivers having a hand in both. His fist past teased the Dublin keeper off his line, but the incoming Don Mulholland, who was second favourite to get to the ball, had no reverse gear. He got a hand to the ball, and seconds later Seamus Downey slammed to the net. In the second half, Chivers high ball forward saw Hugh Martin McGurk fouled. He took the kick himself and when it somehow squirmed to the net, Lavey had one foot in Croke Park. They still had to breathe a sigh of relief when a late Thomas Davis snapshot, the last kick of the game, flashed across goal “Theyclapped us off at the end of the game and that was a very fitting thing to do,” McGurk remembers. Teenager Brian McCormick kicked - as Lavey finished the job against Salthill to seal their All-Ireland. It was the final step in an enthralling journey. The outpouring of emotion befitted the endless hours of toil and development to reach the pinnacle. It was a victory for community and channelling everything into putting themselves on the map. Johnny McGurk raises the Andy Merrigan Cup at Croke Park  Later in the year, the Derry championships competitive edge was again evident when Dungiven knocked them off their perch, taking all three titles in one swoop in another tense encounter at Glen. Lavey won Ulster again in  before retaining their title the following year, the last time John McLaughlin paid a visit. There is always the regret of missing a second All-Ireland. After having two men sent off, they left themselves too much to do against Skibbereen, who went the whole way. McGurk feels the sendings off were harsh. “I think wed have won it had we got over them,” he laments. “People say we got lucky the year we won the All-Ireland, but there were other years when we were unlucky not to have won a county title. It was hard to win the Derry championship and like most Derry sides, wed have been competitivewed got into Ulster.” When the parish of Lavey wakes up next Wednesday, the first thing theyll remember will be that magical day,  years ago, when a wave of emotion, on the back of years of toil, carried the Andy Merrigan Cup into their lives.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Job Retention Scheme was introduced last March to support businesses and organisations who had to temporarily lay off staff due to the pandemic. The government said it would pay up % of the salary of employees placed on furlough. At one stage, the local council had placed  employees on furlough. The council had agreed to pay the remaining % of the furloughed workers salaries during the lay-off period to ensure they received their full pay. Almost half of the council employees have ed to work but  remain on furlough. Details on the money saved by the council as a result of the furlough scheme were outlined on Tuesday at a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Committee. googletag.cmd.push A report shared with councillors at the meeting revealed that from March last year to January this year, the council had recouped a total of pound,, from the furlough scheme. The furlough scheme had been due to end on April  next. However, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, this week announced that the scheme would be extended to the end of September this year. The Job Retention Scheme has protected more than  million jobs since its inception last year and has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as businesses remain shut. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two years ago, the council commissioned Playboard NI to carry out a detailed audit of all the play facilities available in the local area. The findings of the audit were outlined yesterday at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. Alan Herron, Director of Service Delivery and Development with Playboard NI, told the meeting that they had inspected  play parks in the council area in November and December . They had also consulted with the local communities to find out their views on the play facilities. googletag.cmd.push Mr Herron said the parks had been awarded scores in relation to their standards. The audit report showed that in the council area, only six play parks secured enough points to be placed in the top band. These included Brooke Park, Pennyburn Play Trail, Ballyarnett Play Park and Strathfoyle Park. A total of  parks were assessed to be in the upper mid band category which means they offer a good level of play value but require ongoing maintenance. Some of the local parks in this bracket were St Columbs Park, Galliagh Park, Irish Street Park, Rose Court and Lapwing Way. googletag.cmd.push The next bracket was lower mid band and  parks in the Derry and Strabane council area were placed in this category. In Derry, these included Oakland Park, Shantallow Park, the Fountain Park, Bull Park and Primity Crescent. According to the Playboard NI report, these parks offer a low value of play value and will require upgrading to bring them up to an adequate standard. The final bracket was called the lowest. A total of  parks within the council area were placed in this category by Playboard NI, who said the facilities currently offer a minimal level of play value.     Among the local parks listed in this lowest bracket are Stevenson Park, Fountain Hill, Currynierin, Rossdowney Drive, Hazelbank and Ballynagard. The Playboard NI report put forward a number of recommendations on how the local play facilities can be improved. Karen McPhillips, the councils Director of Environment and Regeneration, said they have started to consider the high level costs needed to improve local play facilities and how the funding can be secured. She said the cost would run to tens of millions of pounds. “We do need to think about how we are actually able to do that and the number of funding sources and cocktail funding that we have in the past been very successful at using to refurbish and develop play facilities and can continue to do so, she said. “The better the funding strategy and the more finances as a council we are able to both lever in and create through our own capital plan, the quicker we will be able to get through all of these.” It was agreed at the meeting that a detailed plan should be put together on the costs involved in upgrading the play facilities and brought before councillors later this year for approval.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two years ago, Derry City and Strabane District Council commissioned Playboard NI to carry out a detailed audit of all the play facilities available in the local area. The findings of the audit were outlined yesterday at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. The report found that more than a third of the  parks in council area were of a poor standard. This included the Currynierin park. Speaking at the meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson said the details of the audit report highlighted the scale of the task that is in front of us all in relation to improving local play facilities. googletag.cmd.push He said he had a number of concerns, particularly in relation to areas of the Waterside. Cllr Jackson said many of the issues had been red-flagged for a considerableof time. He said a consultation had been carried out with the community in Currynierin and a new play facility had been designed for the area and taken through the planning process. He said the project has been spade-ready for a number of years but work has not started. “As a council we have built up expectation in the local community but we delivered absolutely nothing,” he said. “It is not good enough that we bring play facilities or schemes up to the stage where it is spade-ready and then it sits on a shelf.” googletag.cmd.push Cllr Jackson asked for a report to be prepared by council officers specically on the Currynierin park plans to show what funding opportunities have been explored and what barriers have been put in place in relation to the delay with the project. Cllr Jacksons comments were supported by Alliance councillor Philip McKinney who described the current play facilities in Currynierin as an absolute disgrace. Cllr McKinney said thatchildren from the area wanted to use good playing facilities they have to cross two busy roads to access a play park in Drumahoe. In response, Colin Kennedy, the councils Parks Development Manager, said that a funding application for the Currynierin park had been submitted to the Department of Justice but it had been unsuccessful.     He said a further application had been made to the Department of Communities for the necessary funding but added that bid had been left underdetermined. Mr Kennedy said they would bring back a comprehensive report on what has been done to date in relation to the proposed Currynierin park and what the next stages are. He added that there was a huge amount of work to be done on how the council is going to find the funding to deliver on all the proposed play schemes in the local area. DUP Alderman David Ramsey described the park at Rossdowney Drive in the Waterside as dangerous and said that what equipment remained needed to be removed and replaced. It was agreed at the meeting that a detailed plan should be put together on the costs involved in upgrading the play facilities and brought before councillors later this year for approval.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The redevelopment plan has the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades.News of progress to redevelop the town centre site comes after recent confirmation that the location is one of a number of high profile schemes included in a real estate portfolio designed to attract potential national and international developers and investors.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local councils which are part of the Belfast Region City Deal consortium and is hoping for a share of a near poundbn Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive investment package.As work to secure city deal funding continues, the local authorities which form the consortiumhave come together to launch a new portfolio of real estate development opportunities within their respective areas with the aim of attracting global investment, boosting tourism and creating sustainable regeneration.The Irish Street regeneration proposal is one of  schemes being showcased in the so-called Belfast Region Investment Guide which have been identied by the ious councils. The portfolio details potential uses for each site with the guide used to market the development opportunities to developers and investors, both locally and overseas.City Deal members say the compilation of the portfolio is the next step in the progression of the consortium with the overriding aim of creating more and better jobs and attracting investment.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure money from the city deal for a multi-million pound flagship tourism project in Newcastle, with the so-called Mournes Gateway proposal a series of ambitious projects which includes a gondola ride into the heart of the Mourne mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10Mar2021-Council.jpg","title":"Council 159% rates rises third lowest in province  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has imposed the third lowest rates rise in Northern Ireland.The above inflation .% hike to fund the local authorityrsquos poundm budget was unanimously agreed last week by local politicians who described the increase as ldquofair and balanced.New figures confirm that the rise was the the third lowest across the provincersquos  councils, while three local authorities mdash Antrim and Newtownabbey, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid Ulster mdash froze their district rate.The smallest increase of .% was made by Mid and East Antrim Council with the second lowest imposed by Fermanagh and Omagh Council mdash .%.With Newry, Mourne and Down in third spot in terms of the lowest increase, fourth place went to Derry City and Strabane Council which increased its rate by .%.Belfast City Council hiked rates by .%, while Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon sanctioned a .% rates rise.

He had also urged local authorities to also freeze their district rates.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is to create two new funds to help the district recover from the devastating impact of the coronavirus.The Covid revitalisation fund is designed to help the business community, with the local authority also establishing an economic recovery reserve as the district plots its way out of the global pandemic.The local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year represents an increase of pound.m on last year with the rates rise meaning that homeowners with a property valued at pound, will be paying pound. more a year or  pence a month.The organisation also has poundm in its cash reserve.Politicians say the .% increase is needed to cover the cost of delivering economic regeneration, planning services, leisure and community facilities, refuse collection and street cleansing across the district over the next year.Council chief executive, Marie Ward, said when the organisation struck last yearrsquos district rate, it had no concept of the challenges it would face over the following  months due to the global pandemic.She said Covid- had presented ldquosignicant financial challenges to all councils, with Newry, Mourne and Down no exception.Mrs Ward said the local authority was able to sustain many services and play a key role in responding to the pandemic, moving quickly to make its services safe.ldquoWhether it is supporting businesses through virtual workshops, helping residents stay active or connected during lockdown, working with community partners to get help to our most vulnerable residents, or carrying out environmental improvements works in our towns and villages, we have not stood still, she said.With infection numbers reducing and the coronavirus vaccination programme gathering increasing pace, Mrs Ward said that ldquoambitious thinking is required now more, welcoming progress on major plans to regenerate the district which will help bolster the local economy.The chief executive said the local authority has progressed business cases for both the Newry City Centre Regeneration and Gateway to the Mournes projects, while working with its Belfast Region City Deal partners, on progressing number of regional innovation and skills programmes which will produce benefits for the district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10Mar2021-Covid.jpg","title":"Covid cases increase locally  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK and Ardglass are included in a list of  postcode areas in Northern Ireland which have recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases between March  and .Out of  people tested,  positive cases were confirmed on Monday by the Department of Health.The news comes after visitors again flocked to Newcastle and other popular beauty spots across the district last weekend, but the numbers in some other areas were not as high as reported the previous Saturday and Sunday.Police confirmed that last Sunday that they were made aware of reports of traffic congestion and parked cars causing an obstruction within the vicinity of the Trassey Road and Burrenreagh Road near Bryansford.There were also issues at the Bloody Bridge area on the outskirts of the town with a number of tickets issues to drivers for causing an obstruction, while cars were prevented from entering Castlewellan Forest Park on Sunday afternoon for a period as paramedics and the air ambulance crew responded to a medical emergency.Police had promised that they would be providing a ldquovisible presence in the Newcastle area in particular and had asked motorists to adhere to the designated parking areas provided. Cars parks across the resort were full for most of the weekend.People who live in the resort are particularly concerned that with the deadly coronavirus still in circulation, such a large influx of visitors has implications for public health.Local politicians had also highlighted the need for people to continue exercising social distancing and adhering to public health advice, insisting that there was no room for complacency at this crucial time, despite and increase in positive Covid cases across the district and the roll-out of a comprehensive vaccination programme.Senior Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials had met with police ahead of another anticipated busy weekend in a bid to signicantly reduce the number of visitors, with council officials placing cones in the Tollymore and Bryansford areas, with others located at Carrick Little near Slieve Binnian and in the Mournes.In addition, police set up a number of rolling checkpoints on the main approach roads to Newcastle last weekend, with officers also deployed in the heart of the resort.Police also managed parking at the hugely popular Bloody Bridge area on the outskirts of the resort, expressing concern that some drivers had shown little care or attention for pedestrians or other road users by the way they had parked their vehicles, one of which was a Transit van.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke, has praised the response from PSNI, local council, the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the emergency services and others for their response to managing visitors to main tourism hotspots.He said there was a greater presence on the ground which has been welcomed by residents following the ldquodangerous level of visitors who flocked to Newcastle and other ious parts of the district the previous weekend.ldquoI welcome the co-operation between all the ious agencies to improve the safety of residents, continued Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe local council placed traffic cones in a number of areas popular with visitors, while the PSNIhad vehicle checkpoints at main arterial routes into Newcastle area. There were also a number of mobile police patrols in the resort, with tickets issued to motorists for causing an obstruction at a number of areas including the Trassey Track and Bloody Bridge.Cllr Clarke said these measures helped ease the pressures on what he described as ldquonatural environmental treasurers as the district moves into the Covid recovery phase.He added: ldquoIt is clear that extra resources are required to manage and maintain our rights of ways, forests, beaches and our parks. The local council and PSNI will continue to share social media messaging on restricting travel to within  miles, with police confirming that they will continue to remain active across the entire district, not just Newcastle.Many people took to social media after another busy weekend to ask why visitors from outside the district who had travelled quite a few miles were not stopped and sent home.

So I started to think about what I could do and this is where the business came from.After  years of working with adults with learning disabilities, Louise came up with the idea of creating sensory boxes.ldquoRiley is registered blind and is deaf, so he needs a lot of sensory input. I came up with the idea of providing affordable sensory toys and products for children who need them, explained Louise.ldquoAs a special needs mum, I find thatyou go online to find sensory toys, they are hugely expensive.ldquoIrsquove spent four years buying stuff for Riley and I have a good idea of the things that you wouldnrsquot necessarily buy as a sensory product, but that will provide a similar sensory experience.ldquoI tailor my boxes to the child and find out about their sensory needs to determine what type of things would help them, such tactile items or fidget stuff to help with concentration and children who are hyperactive, or visually stimulating items such as light-up toys, calming products or growing products for a darkened room. There are so many sensory needs out there.Louise has been supported from the Go For It Programme in association with Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The programme is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Louise sells mostly through her Facebook page and word of mouth recommendations.ldquoI put up a post on Shop Ireland and I wasnrsquot really expecting the numbers of responses that I got. In the run-up to Christmas I had  orders. I had to turn people away, she explained.The support of the Go For It programme was a key part of the impetus to get the business up and running.The programme is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies and provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Louise joined the Go For It scheme through Down Business Centre and was able to access training.ldquoIt gave me the expertise in what to concentrate on first - I went and saw the accountant and got registered, she says.ldquoI was a bit apprehensive because I had absolutely no business experience, just a good idea. But the project gave me the reassurance that it was a good idea and we have put together a business plan.ldquoJoan OrsquoHara has helped me massively throughout the last few months and continues to be available for guidance should I need it or would recommend the best people to talk to in the subject I need.More recently, Louise has got her mum involved, branching out into making tactile and fidget cushions which are suitable for dementia patients and people with ADHD, autism and anxiety.Cllr Laura Devlin, chairwoman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council said: ldquoThe Go For It Programme provides new entrepreneurs with accessible, free and tailored support in the start-up stage of her business in areas such as financial and business planning, and sales and marketing to help get their business up and running.ldquoI wish Louise every continued success in developing and growing her enterprise and encourage anyone thinking about starting their own business to get in touch with the Go For It Programme.Joan OrsquoHara, business advisor at Down Business Centre added: ldquoItrsquos great to see Louise doing so well with a product that will undoubtedly support a childrsquos development through sensory play.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni.

While friends with John and Junior, Alan said he was also proud to have known their father very well.ldquoTo say that Jim was an acknowledged engineering genius is no overstatement, he continued.ldquoJim told me that he served his apprenticeship at Stewartrsquos Motor Works in Downpatrick before World War Two and thought the world of James Stewart whom he referred to as lsquogolden handsrsquo because he could turn his hand to anything.ldquoJim then worked for the former Ulster Transport Authority during the war and opened his Antrim Road Garage in Ballynahinch in late  which he purchased with a loan from a family friend.Alan also revealed that Jim and his son John sponsored him when he used to race cars.He continued: ldquoOnce Jim, or JN as he was known, started to help me with mechanical development, I quickly moved from being a back marker to a front runner in no amount of time. Jim always said that % of winning was done in the workshop before the race meetings.ldquoJim was very much a self-made man with an independent pattern of thought and kept his motorcycling hobby quite separate from his business interests, Alan explained.ldquoWhile he preferred not to align himself with any dealership other than David Brown Tractors, for whom he did development work and sold numerous new and second-hand tractors, he steadfastly refused to repair road going motorcycles.Alan revealed that it was Jimrsquos love of motorcycles and an interest in tuning and modying British machines, a process later adopted by manufacturers like BSA, Norton and Triumph in the s that earned him a much-envied reputation.He said James was ldquoalways extremely modest about his dramatic successes as he was happy developing innovation after innovation in his own workshop.ldquoJim was certainly well ahead of his time when explaining in simple terms that engines had to be enabled to breathe easily to make them perform better, Alan explained.ldquoHis new thinking about breathing, valve and camshaft design, carbureation and compression ratios brought phenomenal output at , rpm from an ordinary production BSA machine when the company was the worldrsquos biggest motorcycle producers in the mid-s, long before the surge of Japanese two-strokes.Many years later, Alan said he still finds it hard to understand that Jim Brown was given motorcycles by leading manufacturers with an instruction to keep them winning at world class level, which is exactly what he did.He also revealed that a lot of Jimrsquos ideas were incorporated into the BSA cc Victor machine that Jeff Smith used to win the motocross world championship in  and .Alan revealed that in earlier years, Jim provided Irish champion road-racer Wilfie Herron with a race-bike, as he did for Ian McGregor, Campbell Gorman and Tom Herron.ldquoHailed as a wizard, he personally tailored the BSA bikes which brought Mervyn McConkey so much success on grass tracks and motocross events throughout Ireland, he continued.The Crossgar man said that when Jim lost interest in the motorcycle industry because of its domination by Japanese-built machines, he turned to Cosworth, who employed him as a consultant.ldquoJim became great friends with Keith Duckworth, the English mechanical engineer famous for designing the Cosworth double four valve cylinder engine and cylinder head, and was also great friends with Sir Frank Williams and Sir Patrick Head from the Williams Formula One team, said Alan.ldquoThrough my friendship with Jim and his we Minnie and their sons John and Junior, I met some wonderful people.

Wearing the No  shirt, he helped his new team-mates to a - victory. He would go on to make  appearances for the Gunners.Arsenal, like so many post-war clubs, were one in ious stages of flux. The team would change regularly with players often struggling to keep their place for one reason or another.In his second season at the club, he did not feature until December.Arsenal would end the campaign ninth in the table.Despite his infrequent Arsenal appearances, international honours came along.

He came to Perth from Woolwich Arsenal, having already been capped for his country ndash which was Ireland.ldquoA tricky, pocket-sized left winger, he had an unfortunate start to his Muirton career. He signed in January , and made his debut on the sixth of that month in a First Division match against Motherwell.ldquoSaints lost -, but the Perthshire Advertiser, displaying an unusual degree of inaccuracy noted: lsquoThe Englishman [sic], who is by no means a giant, gave indications of being a sound investment for the Saints.

It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The final decision on the way forward will be taken by Mr Weir who met via Zoom with a delegation of parents and St Patrickrsquos Grammar representatives last Wednesday.The Board of Governors at St Patrickrsquos is opposed to the merger, while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos are in favour of the plan going ahead.Members of St Patrickrsquos Board of Governors have urged parents, past pupils and the public to respond to the ongoing consultation, asserting that the outcome ldquowill have a lasting impact, not just in the school, with staff and pupils, but its ramications will be felt throughout the local community in East Down.The Board of Governors and school management say they do not believe the case has been made for the proposals as currently outlined and will be re-stating the reasons for this as part of the public consultation process and insist that they are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.De La Salle High School says the merger will ensure that families in the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority, while St Maryrsquos High insists that an all-ability school can cater for the gted and talented and also support children who need it.Mr Harvey said he was delighted to be able to secure the meeting with the education minister on behalf of St Patrickrsquos representatives and the ldquomany concerned parents who have contacted him on what he described as ldquothis important issue.He said has been working with them over recent days to ensure that their opposition to the current proposals is made clear to Department of Education officials.ldquoThese efforts culminated in last weekrsquos meeting with the education minister and served as a productive opportunity to enlighten him in respect of many of the key issues on the ground that, I believe, make the current amalgamation plans wholly unworkable, said Mr Harvey.ldquoThe plans, as proposed by CCMS, would reduce academic choice for parents and children from Downpatrick and the surrounding areas.ldquoIt would deny many Catholic schoolchildren the opportunity of attending a local selective Catholic grammar school and the proposed intake criteria would place children living in the rural areas beyond the urban Downpatrick area at a severe disadvantage in terms of the likelihood of being offered a place.Mr Harvey is

Please try again later.Submitting...\"Letter to the editorOn Tuesday,newspaper published an article  describing Oprah Winfrey’s interview as masterly and her “singular genius” as a broadcaster.The topics of mental health and racism are serious and should never be ignored. Yet, because Oprah and Meghan drew attention to these topics, it seems that no-one is permitted to criticise, or disagree with the content of the interview. There are questions that need to be asked about that content.Just one example: Meghan mixed three issues together at the beginning: Archie not being a prince Archie not being offered security and concerns over Archie’s skin colour. Oprah Winfrey seemed to imply that the absence of a title and security were due to skin colour. Yet, those first two concerns are easily explained, and had nothing to do with Archie’s skin colour – the first is due to King George V’s letter patent in the , and the second due to limited resources that come from the UK taxpayers. Later, Harry spoke of one conversation about skin colour that took place “in the early days of our relationship” — maybe this conversation took place even before the ‘culprit’ had met Megan  Questions like that will always be politically incorrect, at best, indelicate and at worst, racist. However, there is a dference between asking that question before knowing Meghan and after knowing her as a family member who is carrying the Queen’s great-grandchild. Oprah Winfrey allowed the contradictions to stand without being teased out.Journalists have the responsibility to see and pinpoint errors or contradictions in interviews, and especially so with an interview like this one. This interview provided Meghan and Harry the freedom to speak openly about an institution that everyone knows will not reply in the same open and unguarded manner. It was always going to be an unfair fight.My personal opinion, for what it is worth, is that we watched a prime-time promotion for the new brand of Megan and Harry, at the expense of the British royal family. What is more concerning though, is that the majority of journalists in the UK seem to be content to take it all at face value. ‘My truth’ and ‘your truth’ cannot both be true when they contradict each other.Alan Dickey, Stewartstown• Ben Lowry criticises Harry and Meghan’s self pity• Joanne Savage says claims of racism are no surprise——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Already the Orange Order has postponed its own main event, a huge parade to Stormont.Mr Lewis told the News Letter:“I’m going to be very unabashed aboutcontinuing to promote and push the positivity of that becausewe’re not trumpeting what’s brilliant about Northern Ireland, and the reasons to invest in Northern Ireland, we can’t expect others to do it for us.“It’s for us as those who have an understanding of, and a love for, Northern Irelandto do that.”Vowing to promote Northern Ireland and the Union, he said: “I’m not going to apologise - I’m going to be quite punchy about that I think part of my job in the UK government is to promote all parts of the UK and Northern Ireland is a hugely important part of the UK.“One of the other points I feel very strongly about is that I make the argument...that it’s important for Northern Ireland to be part of the UK. We’ve seen through covid what the Treasury could do because of the strength of the four nations together financially.”He said that “the UK is stronger because Northern Ireland is in it”.When askedit was not deeply problematic to be advertising Northern Ireland as a place for investment at a time when the Irish Sea border has disrupted trade and there is uncertainty about the future trading environment, he said that “it’s not just about the centenary year – this is using the centenary year to give a  for the future growth of Northern Ireland.“I would hope that as we get further into the year, as we solve these issues for trade for Northern Ireland, that people would see that there is that potentially competitive advantage as a reason to be based in Northern Ireland.”However, he said that even aside from the terms of Brexit, Northern Ireland has exceptional globally-leading talent in areas such asadvanced manufacturing, cyber security, financial technology, renewable energy, and weapons manufacturers such as Thales which supply the Armed Forces.The programme outlined by the government last night will include academic events which explore the historical context of the centenary.And a partnership with Royal Mail and the Post Office will mean that a special postmark reading ‘Our Story in the Making – Northern Ireland Beyond ’ will be applied to stamped mail sent around the world.Stamped mail across the UK will receive the postmark from  April to  May.

It is judged on those awards and the quality of your signings, and wersquore proud wersquove managed to gain that title.ldquoPenarth is also home to drum and bass clothing brand Concrete Junglists which has become known worldwide, and High Contrast ndash who is a drum and bass icon ndash was born here.Talking more about how he got into the industry, Mr King said: ldquoI always wanted to be involved in the industry and realised by  I wasnrsquot going to make it as a musician.ldquoIt just wasnrsquot coming together and didnrsquot feel like it was me.ldquoItrsquos something Irsquom really passionate about but it started off as quite a light-hearted thing just giving away free music.ldquoThen it started to grow slowly and some people started to approach us, and then in  it just boomed with the top  acclaim. We started getting lots more people approach us, and wersquore now in a great position. Itrsquos been surprising.A host of top DJs including Miaszmafrom Florida, and Austrian duo Divisionand Seculahave signed up to the label, and Incurzion has grown exponentially in Florida, Austria, Germany and Russia.But strangely, Mr King says, he doesnrsquot think the label is known about by many people in Penarth.ldquoI feel wersquore starting to get rewards now for the way wersquove tried to really stand out in what is a saturated market, he said. ldquoWe feel wersquove done that by trying to offer a dferent sound and brand.ldquoOur style is deep and dark drum and bass, dark branding and graphic design ndash almost like horror.ldquoBut most of all itrsquos about bringing on board top quality musicians, and thatrsquos what wersquove managed to do.ldquoItrsquos been a massive shock to see how much interest our music is getting from Florida since Miaszma signed. Itrsquos really exciting.ldquoI donrsquot think people living in Penarth really know about this townrsquos standing in the drum and bass industry. Itrsquos quite unbelievable for a small town to have such a big connection, and I think it needs to be celebrated more.As lockdown hit last March, so did all of Incurzionrsquos events, which kept Mr King busy every week.He believes musicians have been ignored throughout the pandemic, which he worries may have caused a mental health crisis in the industry.ldquoAs live events go wersquove been absolutely decimated, he said. ldquoThe financial impact of that on venues and on companies like ours, as well as inidual musicians, has been unbelievable.ldquoBut fortunately for us our digital sales have been through the roof. That might be because people have more time on their hands at home to explore dferent genres, and itrsquos great they feel they want to purchase our music.ldquoBut the major thing for this industry is the live events, wersquore nothing without those, just like every other label and performer.ldquoThe funding has been awful, and the impact this will have on mental health seems largely ignored.ldquoThis is what we do every single week, and to have that stripped away from you for so long is dficult. Itrsquos also our place to network, so to not have that space will have long-term ramications.ldquoI know venues in Cardf that have had next to no support, andit carries on you canrsquot see how theyrsquod survive.With cases going down by the week, he hopes the music industry will be able to start up just in time for those venues and for musicians.ldquoWersquore obviously very eager to get back to le as it was, and to pick up where we left off.To find out more about Penarthrsquos Incurzion Audio, visit https:www.incurzionaudio Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He was advised there will be a .m high fence around the play area.Councillor Tim McClelland askedofficers were content the parking provision remains adequate at the site.The planning officer advised the Department for Infrastructure had been consulted and accepted that this new attraction may well increase visitor numbers but said despite this, officers are content with the number of spaces available.Alderman Kenneth Twyble said both he and Councillor Declan McAlinden represent this area and described the Lough Neagh Discovery Centre and its surroundings as “the jewel in our crown”.“I think this is wonderful and we must give it our total support,” said Alderman Twyble.“There is a y road down to it but that is part of the facilities. This is a welcome piece of good news for the area.”Councillor Ciaran Toman askeda safety barrier had been considered for users of the park and his question was answered by Alderman Twyble who informed him there was a one-way system in operation and the paths keep people separatefrom vehicles.Councillor Declan McAlinden said the redevelopment of this play park would be an “excellent addition to what is already there”.and proposed the recommendation to approve the planning application.This proposal was seconded by Alderman Twyble and the committee voiced its agreement.Call for action over troubled GP Practice - read hereEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

The decision, which was agreed by the Executive today, means that the youngest pupils will continue with face-to-face teaching for the remainder of this term. Decisions on the timing for theof other primary and post-primary pupils will be considered next Tuesday as part of an overall review of the current restrictions. Students in years  to , who will be awarded qualication results this summer, willto full time face-to face teaching with effect from March , . Education Minister Peter Weir said: “I welcome the decision by the Executive today to allow the youngest pupils to continue with face-to-face teaching until the start of the Easter holidays. “I know that many schools, parents and other pupils want clarity on when more year groups will be ing. I will continue to make the case for all pupils toas soon as practicably possible and in line with public health advice and scientic evidence. “It is clear that long periods away from the classroom has a signicant impact on the mental health and well-being of our children and young people.
